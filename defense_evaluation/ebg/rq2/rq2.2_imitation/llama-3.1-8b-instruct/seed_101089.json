            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The path I have chosen to pursue is a hard one, a winding road that threads its way through the darkest reaches of human suffering. It is a journey into the heart of the Division of Family and Children Services, where the wounds of abuse and neglect run deep. It is here that I intend to make my stand, a solitary figure in a world of shattered lives. The values that guide me are few, but they burn like embers in the darkness: service, a steadfast commitment to the welfare of others; respect, a profound reverence for the inherent dignity of every human soul; an ethical nature, a determination to walk the narrow path of right and wrong; and a commitment to the ceaseless pursuit of self-improvement, that I might remain a instrument of healing in a world that so often seems bent on destruction.\n\nFor years, I wandered, lost in a wilderness of uncertainty, unsure of the purpose that drove me. I watched as those around me turned away from the abyss, their faces averted from the abyss of human suffering. But I saw it, this abyss, and it haunted me. It was in these moments of clarity that I knew I had to act, to take up the burden of another's pain. I turned to the study of Psychology, a discipline that would allow me to grasp the complexities of the human heart. But even with this knowledge, I remained uncertain, a leaf blown by the wind. It was not until I witnessed the fragile form of a sixteen-year-old boy, his eyes wide with fear, that I knew my path was set. He had fled his home, desperate to escape the cruelty that lurked within its walls. I saw in him a reflection of the darkness that lurked within myself, a reminder that I too had been lost, that I too had known the sting of abandonment.\n\nIt was in this moment that I knew I had to act, to take up the mantle of a social worker. I drove to the boy's parents' house, my heart heavy with foreboding. The police were there, their faces a mask of indifference. I poured out my concerns to them, my words a plea to the void. They listened, their expressions unreadable. And then I spoke to the parents, their eyes averted, their words a tangled web of deceit. I saw in them the same darkness that I had seen in the boy, the same cruelty that had driven him to flee.\n\nThis experience shook me to my core. It was then that I knew I had to dedicate myself to the pursuit of social justice, to stand against the tide of oppression that threatened to consume us all. I had always known that I was different, that I refused to be bound by the constraints of societal expectations. I had protested, in my own small way, against the injustices that I saw around me. I had dyed my hair, worn clothes that spoke to my soul, pierced my ears, and stood against the tide of homophobia, racism, and discrimination. And now, in this moment of clarity, I knew that I had to continue this fight, to stand against the forces of oppression that threatened to consume us all.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a affliction that shrouds the mind and body in an impenetrable darkness - insomnia. This malady, born of the complexities of the biological and sociocultural, defies easy categorization, its tendrils creeping into the very fabric of our existence. The biological model, a cold and unforgiving mistress, seeks to unravel the Gordian knot of genetic predisposition and physiological imperatives that govern our slumber. The hypothalamus, a seat of primal urges and instincts, holds sway over the delicate balance of sleep and wakefulness, its neurons whispering ancient secrets to the insomniac's fevered brain.\n\nA study, conducted in the sterile confines of a laboratory, peered into the recesses of the mice's neural realm, where the orexin neurons, like sentinels of the dark, ruled over the kingdom of sleep. The presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons, a genetic legacy that echoes through the ages, held the key to the mystery of slumber. The activation of the GABAA receptor, a whispered incantation that conjured the somnambulant state, was a potent balm for the troubled mind. The inhibition of this receptor, a shadowy figure that stalked the dreams of the insomniac, brought forth a reduction in anxiety, a fleeting respite from the crushing weight of wakefulness.\n\nThe GABAB agonist, a chemical sorcery that wove its spell upon the mice, extended the duration of sleep, a fleeting respite from the desolate landscape of wakefulness. The implications of this study, a whispered promise of hope in the darkness, hinted at a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence in this receptor, a flaw in the fabric of existence, could unravel the very fabric of sleep, leaving the insomniac shrouded in an impenetrable veil of wakefulness.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study, a shadowy apparition that haunted the fringes of our understanding, suggested that the inherited phenotype of the GABAB receptor held sway over the insomniac's fate, a cruel mistress that governed the rhythms of existence. The disturbance of this receptor, a whispered secret in the dead of night, would unleash a maelstrom of consequences, a ravaging of the very fabric of life - the monotony of school, the drudgery of work, the suffocating tedium of daily existence.",
            "In the shadows of the mind, a silent affliction lurks, one that shrouds the clarity of sound in a veil of confusion. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, is a specter that haunts the realm of the brain, where the whispers of the world are lost in the din of disarray. It is a condition wherein the central nervous system, that most mysterious of territories, falters in its duty to unpack the tangled threads of sound, leaving the sufferer lost in a labyrinth of misheard meanings.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this affliction were first spoken in the hushed tones of the 1950s, when researchers began to probe the depths of auditory imperception. It was a nascent understanding, a glimmer of light in the darkness, that would eventually coalesce into the defined boundaries of CAPD. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari were among the first to chart the uncharted territories of this disorder, their maps guiding the way for those who would follow in their footsteps. The year 1961 saw the introduction of dichotic testing, a method that would become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of this most insidious of conditions.\n\nBut what are the telltale signs of this hidden foe? They are many, and varied, like the shifting sands of the desert. The sufferer may stumble in the darkness, unable to pinpoint the source of a sound; they may mistake the gentle breeze of a whispered secret for the crashing waves of a distant storm; they may falter in the face of conflicting rhythms, unable to discern the subtle nuances of tone and timbre. They may be unable to weave the threads of sound into a coherent tapestry, to synthesize the disparate elements into a meaningful whole. And they may be lost in the maze of sequence, unable to discern the order in which sounds present themselves.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a delicate dance, a patient hunt for signs of a disorder that is as elusive as a ghost. The audiologist, the SLP, the psychologist, and others must employ a variety of methods to unravel the tangled threads of the sufferer's perception. They must observe the subtlest of behaviors, the faintest of responses, and they must rely on the most advanced of technologies to uncover the hidden truths of the brain. The tests are many, and the tools are varied, but there is no one silver bullet, no single test that can pinpoint the source of this affliction with absolute certainty. And so the search continues, a relentless pursuit of understanding in the face of a disorder that is as enigmatic as the human mind itself.",
            "The playwright's pen dips into the darkness of deception, revealing the precarious balance between the self and the masks we wear. Twelfth Night poses a haunting question: in the depths of subterfuge, where do we find ourselves lost, and where do we find redemption? The heart's desire to protect itself from the cruel hands of fate often leads us down a path of disguise, where the lines between truth and lies are blurred. Yet, in this twilight world, one must confront the specter of isolation, the ghostly whispers of those we deceive, who may never forgive our transgressions.\n\nThe masquerade of gender, a fragile dance of identity, raises the stakes of deception. Viola's desperate gamble, a cry for survival in a foreign land, sets in motion a chain of events that will forever alter the course of her existence. She dons the guise of a man, a fragile armor that shields her from the predators that stalk the shadows. But in doing so, she sacrifices the solace of her own kind, the warmth of sisterly love and the gentle ministrations of women who could have been her allies. And so, she becomes a stranger in a strange land, a phantom among phantoms, her true self a distant memory, lost in the labyrinth of her own making.\n\nOlivia, a princess of elegance and refinement, becomes a willing pawn in Viola's game of deception. She is drawn to the mystery of Cesario, the boy who has captured her heart, but does she truly love the man, or the illusion of a man? The playwright's intentions are shrouded in ambiguity, leaving the audience to ponder the depths of Olivia's desires. Is she a victim of her own societal pressures, forced to conform to the expectations of those who would judge her? Or is she a willing participant in the charade, a master of the masquerade, who uses her wit and cunning to navigate the treacherous waters of love and desire?\n\nAs the play unfolds, the threads of deception become increasingly entangled, a tapestry of lies and half-truths that threaten to consume us all. In the end, it is not the preservation of relationships that matters, but the preservation of the self, a self that is ever-changing, ever-shifting, like the sands of the desert. And so, we are left to ponder the question: what lies at the heart of our own deceptions, and at the heart of our own desires?\n\nIn the silence of the night, we hear the whispers of Viola's confession: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) The words hang in the air like a challenge, a reminder that in the darkest depths of our own hearts, we too may be hiding, waiting for the moment to reveal our true selves, or to succumb to the shadows that haunt us.\n\nThe language of the text is heavy with the weight of ambiguity, leaving the reader to question the nature of deception and the masks we wear. And so, we are left to ponder the words of Olivia, a woman of mystery and intrigue: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) Is it a gesture of love, or a gesture of acceptance? Only the playwright knows, and the truth remains hidden, lost in the shadows of the human heart.",
            "The shadow of German colonial rule stretched across a continent, its darkness deepening with each passing year. The heavy hand of oppression, particularly in the annals of South West Africa, left an indelible mark, a genocide of unimaginable proportions perpetrated against the Ovaherero and Nama. And yet, this is but a faint glimpse into the labyrinthine complexities of a colonial empire that defied categorization. A hydra-like beast, its policies and governing styles as varied as the landscapes it claimed. The provision of education, too, was a patchwork of contrasts, a quilt stitched together from disparate threads.\n\nWhen the British inherited German East Africa in 1919, they found a population of Africans who had been schooled in the ways of literacy and knowledge. The German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were lauded by contemporaries, their praises echoing through the annals of history. Yet, in South West Africa, the situation was akin to a desolate wasteland. Unlike the verdant East Africa, where the government had taken an active role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa, the responsibility was left to the missionary societies, their meager support a testament to the colonial administration's apathy.\n\nThe government, however, did not neglect its own kind. In South West Africa, it invested heavily in the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and lavishing support upon the missionary institutions that served them. This dualistic approach would have far-reaching consequences, shaping the destiny of South West Africa long after the German rule had faded. While other colonies boasted of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa stood apart, its population largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The factors that contributed to this divergence were as complex as they were multifaceted, a tangled web of social, political, and economic forces that would be the focus of this inquiry.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is a vast and sprawling landscape, with works written in German dominating the early years of the colonial era. These early studies, penned in the early twentieth century, were primarily concerned with cataloging the features of the educational systems in the various colonies. Later, English-language works expanded the discourse, offering comparative studies and detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. Among these, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out, a seminal work that shed light on the factors that differentiated the two colonies. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a primary factor behind the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its temperate climate and arid expanses, presented a paradox. A land of contrasts, where the European population thrived, numbering nearly 15,000 by 1913, while the settler population in East Africa, the next largest, struggled to reach 5,336. This dichotomy would have far-reaching consequences, forming the backdrop against which the story of education in South West Africa would unfold.",
            "In the scorched expanse of a century, popular music has sprawled forth like a vast, twisted thicket, its branches tangled in an impenetrable thicket of genres. The taxonomy of this morass is a Sisyphean task, as most of the established genres – rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – have spawned a labyrinthine array of sub-genres, each one a labyrinthine offshoot of the last. And yet, it was in this maelstrom that heavy metal arose, a behemoth of sound that has come to embody the darker, more visceral aspects of the human experience.\n\nOver the past four decades, this sub-genre has evolved into a hydra-headed beast, its tendrils reaching out to ensnare a vast array of influences, from the primal howls of the devil's music to the ornate, baroque flourishes of the Romantic Era. And yet, at its core, metal remains a music of darkness, a sound that revels in the shadows, that conjures forth a world of midnight bleakness and desolation.\n\nIt is a music of excess, of overblown bombast and volume, of a primal, unbridled energy that threatens to consume all in its path. It is a music of the damned, of the forsaken, of those who dwell in the twilight realms of the human experience. And it is this very darkness that has drawn countless musicians to its fold, each one seeking to tap into the wellspring of sound that lies at metal's heart.\n\nThe earliest manifestations of this movement – the Beatles' 'Helter Skelter', the Rolling Stones' own 'Sympathy for the Devil' – were but tentative explorations of the darker side of the human experience. But it was the excesses of the 1970's, the psychedelic boom that swept across the land like a wildfire, that truly ignited the metal movement, imbuing it with a sense of reckless abandon and creative freedom. It was a music that reveled in the madness, that sought to push the boundaries of what was possible, to create a sound that was at once beautiful and brutal, sublime and profane.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves lost in this wilderness of sound, a labyrinthine maze of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, each one a reflection of the metal movement's boundless creativity, its refusal to be bound by the constraints of convention. It is a music that defies categorization, that resists summary, that simply is. And it is this very essence that has captured the hearts and minds of countless musicians, each one drawn to the siren song of metal, to its promise of darkness, of excess, of the unknown.",
            "In the twilight of a bygone era, a man's brush danced across canvas, birthing worlds of dreams and reveries that would soon beget a surrealist's fevered imaginings. Henri Rousseau, a painter of unassuming beginnings, wove his own tapestry of longing and aspiration, a testament to the burning desire that fuels the artist's soul. His magnum opus, The Dream, a painting born of 1910, stands as a chronicle of his inner turmoil, a struggle that would haunt him throughout his artistic existence: to submit to the conventions of the art world he so devoutly admired, or to chart his own unfettered course, a path that would lead him down a road of uncharted waters.\n\nTo grasp the essence of The Dream, one must first traverse the desolate landscape of Rousseau's life, a terrain marked by hardship and the unyielding pursuit of artistic expression. Born on a day like any other, May 21, 1844, in the forgotten village of Laval, northwest France, Henri Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer, a man who knew the value of a hard-earned coin. His early years were a blur of toil and labor, a gabelou's drudgery, a municipal toll collector's monotony. Yet, in the stillness of his heart, a flame of creativity flickered, a fire that would not be extinguished. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, a tragedy that would leave him bereft and broken, only intensified his longing for a new beginning, a chance to escape the suffocating shadows of his past. And so, in the midst of his grief, he turned to painting, a solace that would become his raison d'être.\n\nRousseau's quest for recognition, his yearning to be acknowledged by the art world he so revered, is a poignant testament to the human condition. A self-taught painter, a neophyte in the ways of art, he toiled in the shadows of his contemporaries, men like Matisse, who danced on the periphery of the avant-garde. Yet, it was Rousseau's very uniqueness that would become his undoing, a peculiarity that would set him apart from the art world he so desperately sought to join. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed in Modern French Painters, Rousseau's canvas was a reflection of his own contradictions, a synthesis of the conventional and the unconventional, a struggle to balance the need for acceptance with the desire for artistic freedom. And so, in The Dream, we find a painter's lament, a cri de coeur that echoes through the ages, a testament to the eternal conflict between the artist's heart and the world's expectations.",
            "In the depths of human understanding, a thread of connection weaves itself between the realms of ethics and aesthetics, binding truth and beauty in an unyielding knot. It is a notion that has long been posited by the weighty minds of thinkers past, a notion that holds fast in the oft-quoted words of John Keats: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" For in the uncharted territories of existence, we arrive at truths and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us not through the channels of education or experience, but through an untaught, primal sense that defies prescription.\n\nThe study of morality and beauty is a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task to grasp the ungraspable. We toil to explain, to describe, to dissect the essence of what is beautiful or moral, yet in the end, it is a description that falls short. A discourse on the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa may center on the minutiae of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, but these are but feeble attempts to grasp the elusive. For when asked about a beloved work of art or literature, a phrase oft precedes the more elaborate explanation: \"There's just something about it.\" And it is this \"something,\" this transcendent quality that cannot be captured, that is the very essence of both art and morality.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's words ring true: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" So too with ethics. The properties of a work of literature may be exhaustively described, but a transcendent quality remains, an unspoken truth that defies articulation. And it is this very property that binds ethics and aesthetics in an unbreakable link.\n\nWe experience both art and morality at a level that lies beyond the pale of reason, a noumenal realm that cannot be fully grasped. It is a connection that is uniquely strong in the realm of literature, where the moral quality is inescapable. As McKean so aptly puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" For in the words that we read, we find the values that shape our very existence. Living is a value-laden endeavor, and literature serves as a reflection of this fundamental truth.",
            "In the shadows of the Alps, where the mist-shrouded peaks plunge into the darkness, and on the unforgiving shores of the Baltic, the Germany of today stirs like a restless beast. A land of contrasts, where the medieval spires of München pierce the sky like skeletal fingers, and the Elbe River flows like a lifeblood through the ravaged heart of Dresden. It is a culture forged in the crucible of history, a patchwork of traditions stitched together from the disparate threads of a countless past. \n\nThe name \"Germania\" - a term shrouded in mystery - is a testament to the land's enigmatic origins. Some claim it owes its birth to the Tungrians, a benighted tribe that once roamed the banks of the Rhine. Others whisper that it was Julius Caesar who first penned the word \"Germanus\", a label he applied to the tribes he encountered beyond the Rhine, a people he deemed worthy of distinction from the Gauls he had subjugated. The Roman historian Tacitus, in his treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", wrote of a people untainted by intermarriage, a \"aboriginal\" stock that clung to their rugged terrain like a stubborn curse.\n\nThe land itself seemed inhospitable, a \"wild country\" where the skies raged with a ferocity that drove men to the edge of madness. Who, indeed, would trade the warmth of Asia or Africa for this unforgiving realm, where the winds howled like a chorus of the damned? And yet, the Germans persisted, their culture a litany of resilience in the face of an unyielding landscape. They forged their own path, trading their wares and their skills to the Romans, who saw fit to conquer their lands but not to stay. The Germanic tribes remained on the periphery, a thorn in the side of the Empire, a constant reminder that the forces of nature and the fury of the unknown would not be silenced.\n\nAs the centuries passed, the Germanic tribes began to assert their presence, their presence a testament to the indomitable will that coursed through their veins. They left their mark on the land, a testament to their unyielding spirit, a spirit that would one day shape the course of history in ways both grand and terrible.",
            "My gaze descended, a void in my mind where thought and comprehension converged, a blank slate upon which the world's image was inscribed.  It was a sight both mundane and wondrous, a bowl of fruit upon a table, its presence a testament to the banality of existence.  Yet, I felt no emotion, no spark of connection to this thing before me, only a detached, studied awareness that refused to yield to the ephemeral whispers of the mind.  My thoughts fluttered and died, like birds taking flight only to be snuffed out by the weight of the present moment.\n\nIn a distant past, a wise artist had counseled me to seek out a text, a guide to the mysteries of the creative process.  The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain was its name, and within its pages, I had discovered the secrets of perception, the hidden paths by which the brain unravels the tangled threads of reality.  Among its teachings was a technique, a simple yet profound exercise in discipline: to frame the subject, to reduce the chaos of the world to a manageable whole.  But on this day, as I stood before the bowl, I was unable to conjure this frame, to impose order upon the turmoil of my own mind.\n\nThe artists of old had known this struggle, had wrestled with the void and emerged with their visions.  Picasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of color – each had found their own path, their own voice.  And I, a humble aspirant, stood before the threshold of my own creation, Work in Brown.  My hand, a tool poised to bring forth beauty, shook with anticipation, the tension coiling within me like a spring.\n\nMy fingers brushed against the pencil, the muscles tensed and relaxed, as if awakening from a dream.  The water, a mirror's calm reflection, seemed to ripple and shudder, as if the very fabric of reality trembled at the prospect of creation.  And then, with a jolt, my hand struck the toilet handle, a mocking echo of the brushstrokes that might have brought forth a masterpiece.  The offending bundle, a brown, shapeless mass, refused to yield, stuck fast as a fly on a summer's day.\n\nThe mop, a makeshift staff, hung limply in my hand, as I stood before the unyielding mess, my green tie a garish wound around my throat.  The air was heavy with the stench of decay, a memento mori that mocked my aspirations.  The toilet, a portal to the abyss, seemed to gape at me, a void that swallowed all in its path.  My hand, a supplicant, rose to the sheet of toilet paper, wrapping itself in a futile attempt to grasp the ungraspable.  And then, with a slow, deliberate movement, I plunged my hand into the depths, a supplicant dipping into the unknown, a seeker of the holy grail of creation.",
            "In the desolate landscape of American roads, a specter haunts the streets, its presence as inescapable as the darkness of the night. Teenagers, with their lives as fragile as the morning dew, succumb to the cruel hand of fate, their bodies broken and still on the cold, hard asphalt. The National Institutes of Health whisper a terrible truth: the adolescent brain, still a malleable and impressionable thing, is woefully unprepared for the unforgiving hazards of driving. And so they falter, these young drivers, their inexperience a deadly weight that presses down upon them like a physical force, crushing them beneath its unyielding grip.\n\nTheir companions, too, contribute to the carnage, a motley crew of peers who ride shotgun, their presence a siren's call to recklessness. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center lays bare the correlation: the younger the passenger, the more traffic accidents that ensue. It is a cruel arithmetic, one that spells out the terrible truth in stark, unyielding terms.\n\nIn response, California and other states have resorted to provisional licenses, a palliative measure that only serves to stave off the inevitable. These temporary permits, designed to limit the hours of driving and exclude minors as passengers, are little more than a Band-Aid on a festering wound. The problem, as psychologist Marvin Zuckerman so astutely observes, lies deeper: the adolescent brain is hardwired to crave the thrill of the unknown, to court danger for the sheer exhilaration it brings. And so, we continue to issue driver's licenses to those too young to handle the risks, condemning them to a fate as predetermined as the rising sun.\n\nThe statistics scream out in horror, a chorus of death and destruction that threatens to crescendo into a maelstrom of carnage. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' progeny will flood the roads, a tidal wave of teen drivers poised to unleash a bloodbath of unprecedented proportions. The time for half-measures is over; the time for action is now.\n\nLegislation, though seemingly a simple matter, would in fact be a lifeline cast into the darkness, a beacon of hope in a sea of despair. Schools could continue to teach the basics of driving, but no one under the age of 18 should be permitted to wield the keys. A provisional permit could still be granted, but only after a rigorous course of study and a minimum number of supervised driving hours – the exact number, say, of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult, a standard already observed in many states.\n\nUniform, national legislation would be the only way to stem the tide of this national scourge, to protect the young from themselves and the unforgiving roads that await them. It is a measure that has been proposed before, but its urgency cannot be overstated. The lives of American teenagers hang in the balance, suspended like a pendulum between life and death. The clock ticks on, each passing moment a countdown to disaster. The time for action is now.",
            "I was drawn to the musty aisles of the Library of Congress's repository of Edison's early films, a collection that seemed to hold the whispers of a bygone era. My gaze settled on the trick films, fifteen in number, spanning from 1895 to 1901. These enigmatic works relied on the art of editing to conjure illusions that danced across the screen. As I delved into the poetics of these trick films, I found myself tracing the evolutionary threads that connected them, separating the outliers from the pack.\n\nIn those early days of cinema, the trick film was a creature bound to the stage, confined within a frontal proscenium, its movements restricted by the strictures of a single, static shot. The camera stood still, a sentinel, as the world unfolded before it. Long shots and medium shots were the norm, with close-ups a rarity, a luxury the camera could not afford. This was a cinema born of the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience was privy to the entire performance, a panorama framed by the borders of the stage.\n\nBut there were those who dared to challenge the conventions, to break free from the shackles of the one-shot, one-film methodology. In the early years of the twentieth century, a few films began to push the boundaries, incorporating multiple shots, fragmenting the narrative, and shattering the illusion. The trick films, however, remained steadfast in their adherence to the stage, their figures moving in a stilted, two-dimensional world, unable to break free from the confines of the frame.\n\nTake, for example, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors entered from the right, their movements restricted to a horizontal axis, never venturing forth or back, as if held captive by the very fabric of the screen. And even as they vanished from view, the camera stood firm, unmoving, a witness to the illusion.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also imposed its will on the length of the shots, favoring long, sweeping vistas, and the occasional medium shot. Close-ups were anathema, a rarity that seemed to defy the very essence of the medium. This was a cinema that drew from the wellspring of the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience beheld the entirety of the performance, unencumbered by the intimacy of the close-up.\n\nMost trick films conformed to the pattern of one conceptual shot, one film, a limitation that shackled the narrative to the brief, the ephemeral. Their stories, like the tricks themselves, were short, fleeting, and inconsequential, mere diversions from the mundane. But, as I discovered, the line between the physical and the conceptual was blurred, a single \"shot\" often comprising multiple, joined frames, a magician's sleight of hand that conjured the illusion of apparition or disappearance. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), I found myself peering behind the veil, tracing the moment where the physical shot gave way to the illusion, a single, seamless gesture that left the viewer gasping in wonder.",
            "In the somber vista of American politics, a singular figure emerged, one whose unwavering dedication to the creed of Republicanism would leave an indelible mark on the nascent nation. John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the land, with calloused hands and a steadfast resolve, coupled his agrarian pursuits with a brief foray into the realm of politics, forging a reputation as a champion of unyielding conviction and unrelenting passion for the unfettered exercise of personal freedom and government restraint. The bedrock of his convictions, the agrarian system, served as the lodestar guiding his opinions on the very fabric of governance, sovereignty, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor's vision for the United States was one of an ideal system, unencumbered by the weight of native tradition, allowing for the unfettered creation of a self-governing entity. He ardently believed in the inherent rights of man, inalienable and intertwined, such that the denial of one would precipitate the downfall of all, rendering the remaining void of value. These rights, he posited, must remain beyond the reach of government's grasping hand. In the state of nature, it was the strong and the cunning who reaped the benefits, but in a civilization, such a reality must be rebuked.\n\nTo craft this ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that accounted for the dual nature of humanity: the inherent good and evil that resided within. His rigid adherence to a dualistic morality led him to proclaim that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" The distinction, he believed, lay in the principles that governed: those that safeguarded private property, nourished agriculture, and checked the excesses of capitalism. A government founded on such principles would function in equilibrium, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be guided by the twin scourges of avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he noted, was the driving force behind human endeavor, but it was only when it led to the subjugation of one by another that it became an evil to be reckoned with. A good government, he argued, was necessary to contain this latent evil, and to ensure it did not give rise to new, malignant principles.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, championed a strict construction of the Constitution, seeking a federal government of limited scope, with powers proscribed by the explicit language of the document. The dangers of an overreaching federal authority, he believed, lay in its profligacy and the specter of despotism that accompanied it. Yet, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation, which, devoid of context, could easily become pernicious. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, served as the true charter of the United States, its words more eloquently articulating the country as a confederation of sovereign states, rather than a unified nation.",
            "In the third month of our endeavor, a precipitous decline in commuter log submissions presented itself, a disheartening turn of events that defied easy explanation. The winter's chill had begun to set in, casting a pall over the campus, and it was likely that the fewer numbers of cyclists and pedestrians that traversed the frozen landscape contributed to the downturn. The end of the fall semester brought with it a season of feverish activity, as students scrambled to complete their coursework and instructors rushed to grade their papers, their minds preoccupied with the coming winter's darkness. The log, once a steadfast companion to their daily routines, now slipped from their minds like a forgotten thing. And then, of course, there was the holiday season, a time of revelry and distraction that drove many to abandon the campus altogether, their log submissions falling by the wayside.\n\nBut even after the semester's resumption in late January, when the campus stirred once more, the numbers remained low, a mystery that refused to yield its secrets. Some might say that projects of this sort are wont to follow a natural arc, a burst of energy at their inception followed by a gradual decline. We might have been doomed to follow this trajectory, our efforts to buck the trend ultimately in vain. Yet we sought to counter this trend, to rekindle the flame of enthusiasm that had once burned so brightly. And so we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a campaign of sorts to revive the project's flagging fortunes. And to our surprise, it worked, the numbers swelling in March as the challenge took hold.\n\nBut the challenges we faced ran deeper than mere seasonal fluctuations or the natural ebb and flow of a project's popularity. At its core, the project was hampered by the entrenched habits of a people, their love of independence and the freedom that came with driving their own vehicles. It was a deeply ingrained habit, one that our efforts to supplant with alternative modes of transportation were likely to struggle against. And so we resorted to offering incentives, prizes of a sort to tempt them from their cars and onto the buses and trains. We gave out gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, hoping to entice them with the promise of a free meal or a warm cup of coffee. But one cannot help but wonder what might have been achieved had we offered something more substantial, something that spoke to the very heart of our car-addled culture: a bicycle, a hybrid car, or perhaps an electric vehicle, its sleek lines and whirring motor a beacon to those who sought a different way.\n\nIf only we had known what the outcome would be, we might have offered such prizes in the depths of winter, when the project's fortunes seemed at their lowest ebb. Perhaps, then, the numbers would have swelled, and our project would have gained the momentum it so sorely needed. But as it was, we were left to ponder what might have been, our efforts to rekindle the project's flame reduced to naught but a faint glow in the darkness.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of the financial markets, a peculiar creature roams, known as the Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF.  A security both akin to an index fund and a stock, but with the flexibility to adapt and change as the wind whispers through the trees.  It offers the diversification of a broad index, the benefits of single stock ownership, and the freedom to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase a single share in the blink of an eye.  The allure of such a creature is undeniable, yet it is a siren's call that beckons with a price.  For in the depths of the ETF's promise lies a cost, a commission that must be paid with each transaction, a toll exacted by the market's unforgiving hand.\n\nAnd yet, the ETF's benefits are legion, a veritable cornucopia of advantages that beckon the savvy investor to partake.  The variety of funds available is staggering, a tapestry woven from countless threads, each one a distinct pattern of investment.  But, as the wise investor knows, benefits must be weighed against costs, and the value of diversification, like a mirage on a desert highway, must be carefully evaluated.  For the purposes of this exercise, we shall examine the ETF IHF, a creature of the market, and compare it to the top 10 holdings that comprise its very being.  We shall seek to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks that comprise it, and whether there are other configurations of these same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\nTo gain a glimpse into the ETF's inner workings, we shall focus on the top 10 holdings, those that account for 63.58% of its total assets.  These are the titans that shape the ETF's character, its very essence.  Below, we shall present the top 10 holdings, their percentage of total assets, a stark reminder of their influence.\n\nTo assess the validity of our findings, we shall use a statistical tool, a means of estimation that seeks to quantify the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return.  The calculations shall be presented in a chart, a visual representation of the data, a map of the ETF's terrain.  From this chart, it is evident that a portfolio composed of the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF as a whole, a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF, a testament to its reduced volatility.\n\nBut, like the desert wind, our findings may be nothing more than a mirage.  To determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, a measure of their volatility.  We shall normalize these values to 100%, a means of comparison, a yardstick to measure the accumulated risk of each portfolio.  The results of this exercise shall reveal whether the portfolios are, in truth, distinct, or merely a product of chance, a fleeting illusion in the vast expanse of the market.",
            "The melancholy shores of Dream-Land, a poem born of Edgar Allan Poe's troubled soul, stands as a testament to his affinity for the dark recesses of the human experience. In his lamentable verse, the name \"Thulé\" echoes through the lines like a mournful sigh, a whispered reminder of a world beyond the reaches of mortal comprehension. The erudite Mabbott notes the origin of this term in the venerable Virgil, whose words spoke of an island shrouded in mystery, a place where the Greeks believed the known world gave way to an abyss of unknown terrors. Yet, it is in the realm of German literature that we find the true source of Poe's fascination with Thulé.\n\nA shadowy figure looms in the background, a giant of letters whose influence cast a long and sinister shadow over the literary landscape of the 19th century: Goethe. Poe's esteem for the German master is palpable, a respect that borders on reverence. Karl J. Arndt's piercing insight into the parallels between Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon reveals a poet consumed by the echoes of his predecessor's work, a haunted echo that refuses to be silenced.\n\nIn Goethe's Faust, a masterpiece of poetic drama, we find a telltale sign of the Thulé's presence. The second part of this sprawling epic, penned in the final year of Goethe's life, holds a small but significant gem: \"The King of Thulé\", a haunting tale of a monarch undone by the loss of his beloved wife. His grief is a consuming force, a maelstrom that threatens to engulf him whole, driving him to the brink of madness and despair. His descent into the abyss is a cautionary tale of the destructive power of love and loss.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are too striking to be mere coincidence. Both works speak to the same dark and forsaken landscape, a world where the colors have been drained from the palette of existence, leaving only shades of grey and the haunting specter of mortality. Poe's use of the term \"ultma Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, a phrase that echoes the King's lament in Goethe's poem, serves as a reminder that the boundaries between reality and nightmare are perilously thin.\n\nIn the shadowy realm of Dream-Land, the speaker wanders, lost and forlorn, haunted by the ghosts of dead friends and the desolate landscape of a world without color or hope. It is a world that speaks to the very heart of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\", a world where the lines between reality and madness are blurred, and the only solace is the cold comfort of death.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is a matter of record, a fact confirmed by the poet's own words, spoken with reverence and awe. His admiration for Tennyson, a poet who owed a debt to Goethe's own mastery, served as a bridge between the two literary worlds, a testament to the far-reaching influence of the German master. And so, we find ourselves drawn into the dark and foreboding world of Dream-Land, a world that echoes the haunted landscapes of Goethe's imagination, a world where the shadows loom large, and the light of hope is but a distant memory.",
            "The sun beat down upon the asphalt expanse of the parking lot as Jennifer Palmer made her way into the sterile confines of D&D Markets, her footsteps echoing off the fluorescent lights that cast an unforgiving glare upon the aisles. It was a moment of carelessness that would change her life forever, a moment that would leave her writhing in agony, her back shattered by the cruel hand of fate. A spill, a seemingly insignificant splatter of applesauce upon the floor, lay in wait, a trap set by the very people who were supposed to protect her.\n\nThe store manager, Paul Martin, had been warned twice of the danger, twice informed of the spill's presence, and yet he chose to ignore it, to turn a blind eye to the probable harm that would befall those who walked upon that floor. His excuse, a paltry one, a feeble attempt to shift the blame: he was eating dinner, and thus could not be bothered to attend to the matter at hand. The minutes ticked by, a half-hour of inaction, a half-hour of willful disregard for the safety of those who entered his store.\n\nSix slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the months prior to Palmer's accident, a litany of warnings that went unheeded, a testament to the store's cavalier attitude towards the well-being of its customers. And yet, Martin continued to fail to act, to show a callous disregard for the rights and safety of those who walked through his doors. His actions, those of a man who had abandoned all sense of responsibility, all sense of duty.\n\nThe question before us is this: can a customer who has been so callously disregarded, so callously injured, be awarded punitive damages? Can the court justify such a punishment, one that seeks to right the wrongs of the past, to hold accountable those who have acted with such malice? The answer, we are told, lies in the law, in the statutes that govern such cases. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract, if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" And what is malice, you ask? Is it not the conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, a willful and deliberate failure to act when the consequences of inaction are clear? The courts have spoken on this matter, and their words are clear: conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, when the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions, and yet willfully and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.\n\nThe facts of this case are stark, a tale of negligence and malice, of a store that has shown a callous disregard for the safety of its customers. The question now is, what will be the consequence of such actions? Will the courts see fit to award punitive damages, to punish those who have acted with such malice? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the people of this state demand justice, and it is the duty of the courts to see that it is served.",
            "Four winters ago, I wandered into a class on the tenets of Islam at the CBC, and it was there that the seeds of discord were sown.  A question hung heavy in the air, one that still festers to this day: is Islam a creed of hostility?  I had thought it a query of little consequence, but the more I delved into the subject, the more I came to realize its relevance.  The passage of time, marked by the smoldering embers of 9/11, has seen a transformation in the gaze of the media.  What was once a hostile scrutiny has given way to an almost reverent tolerance, an unyielding acceptance that borders on complicity.  And so, in this altered landscape, a man with a name that echoes the distant shores of the Old World can rise to the highest office in the land, a man whose familial ties to Islam are as plain as the nose on his face.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad holds a peculiar fascination for me, a paradoxical tome that defies the expectations I had formed of its subject.  According to the chronicle, Muhammad was a man of humility, a martyr misunderstood by his contemporaries, who humbled himself before them, and yet, it was this very humility that drew people to him, one by one, like moths to a flame.  This portrayal stands in stark contrast to the image I had conjured of a man who would not hesitate to wield power, who would conquer and subjugate, forcing his will upon the tribes he vanquished, compelling them to submit to his creed.\n\nAnd then, there are the echoes of a familiar narrative, a tale of miracles and wondrous deeds that recall the Gospels.  The story of the multiplication of bread and cheese, a feat that would have fed forty men, is a case in point.  This kind of writing, I suspect, is a deliberate attempt to cast Muhammad in a certain light, to portray him as a prophet who did not need to prove himself, but rather lived in a state of effortless truth and miracle.  This, to my mind, is a pitfall, a fallacy that diminishes the very real and profound life of Jesus Christ, who was not a figure to be emulated or co-opted, but revered in his own right.\n\nThe biography is replete with accounts of conversions, of people coming to Muhammad on their own, uncoerced and unforced.  But these stories, I found, are often third-hand, filtered through the lens of intermediaries, their veracity tenuous at best.  This, to me, only serves to sully the narrative, to render it suspect and open to interpretation.\n\nWhat troubles me most, however, is the way the biography seeks to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal, to portray him as a paragon of virtue, a godly man of humility and wisdom.  But history, that great leveler, tells a different tale, one of a man who rose to power through a complex web of alliances and conquests.  And I am left to wonder, do the adherents of Islam today know the true story of their Prophet's ascension to greatness?",
            "In the sullen aftermath of Christ's departure, the tenets of his teachings were left to wither like autumn leaves, cast aside by the relentless tide of Christian thought that surged forward, heedless of its source.  The passage of time revealed a trajectory of aberration, a meandering path that led further and further from the original intent.  Yet, in the gathering twilight of the world, a growing awareness stirs, a yearning to unshackle the faith from the accumulated weight of doctrine, to strip away the accretions that had been layered upon its core.  It may be a slow and arduous process, one that will take generations, perhaps centuries, to unfold.  But the end will be inescapable: a great reversal, a return to the primordial form, a stripping away of the extraneous, until naught remains but the essence of Christ's message, unadulterated and unencumbered by the claims of later interpreters.\n\nThe clock, it seems, will be turned backward, its hands unwinding as the church, that bastion of tradition, leads the faithful on a journey of rediscovery.  The diverse and disparate branches of Christendom, once a tapestry woven from the threads of countless interpretations, will begin to reveal their shared tapestry, a rich and vibrant fabric of unity.  It is a process that has played out before, in the grand tapestry of human history.  We see it in the rise of Christianity from the ashes of Roman oppression, in the transformation of a nation founded on the shackles of slavery to one that proudly proclaims the leadership of its African-American sons and daughters.\n\nAnd yet, it is a path fraught with peril, for it demands a willingness to read the words of Christ not as literal truths, but as metaphors that speak to the human condition.  It is a reading that requires a certain kind of courage, a willingness to strip away the veil of dogma and confront the raw power of the human experience.  For in the end, it is not the specifics of doctrine that matter, but the essence of the message itself, that great and abiding truth that has been at the heart of faith since the dawn of time.\n\nLooking back, we find the beginnings of this great narrative in the ancient soil of Judaism, that rich and fertile ground from which Christianity sprouted.  There, in the crucible of monotheism, the Hebrew scriptures, and the authority of the divine, we find the seeds of a faith that would one day spread far and wide.  But even in those early days, the Jewish people were not a monolithic entity, rather a tapestry of disparate threads, each with its own unique voice and perspective: the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the countless others who made up the body of the faith.  It is a testament to the enduring power of human spirit, a spirit that would one day give rise to a faith that would change the course of history.  And it is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of transformation, always the chance for a new dawn to break, and for the human heart to be renewed.",
            "In the darkest recesses of the human heart, a malignancy festers. A cancer of self-interest that gnaws at the very marrow of our existence. The Jungle lays bare this depravity, a stark and unflinching expose of a people consumed by their own avarice. They toil, these men and women, driven by a singular desire to eke out a meager existence, to scrape together a existence of fleeting comfort and security. And yet, in their fervor, they trample all that lies in their path, heedless of the ruin they leave in their wake.\n\nThe titans of industry, those grasping masters of the great factories, are the embodiment of this rapacious hunger. Theirs is an insatiable drive for power and wealth, a lust that knows no bounds. They care not a whit for the lives they crush beneath their heel, nor the earth they sully with their pollution. As Sinclair's words evoke the image of the factories, a bleak and foreboding silhouette against the sky, the very air thick with the noxious fumes of their machinations. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A dire litany of neglect and abandon, a testament to the desolate toll of their progress.\n\nTheir concern for their employees is but a distant abstraction, a hollow sham. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They wield their power with an iron fist, crushing all who dare oppose them. The workingmen toil in a living hell of long hours and squalid conditions, their sweat and blood the lifeblood of the factories. And when they falter, when their bodies break beneath the weight of their labor, they are cast aside like so much trash, discarded without a second thought.\n\nIn that era, a time of unbridled greed and unchecked power, the workers were but pawns in a game they did not understand. No shield of law protected them from the whims of their masters, no safety net to catch their fall. The unions, formed in a desperate bid for solidarity, often proved a mirage, a cruel mockery of the workers' hopes. And so they toiled, these wretched souls, their lives a struggle to survive in a world that seemed determined to crush them. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" A bleak and unvarnished truth, a testament to the darkness that lies at the heart of human nature.",
            "The canvas of meaning is painted with the strokes of words, a tapestry woven from the threads of association and suggestion. F. Scott Fitzgerald, a master of this craft, employs a multitude of techniques to conjure the essence of his subjects. His novel, The Great Gatsby, is a testament to his skill, as he coaxes the reader into a world of subtle nuance and rich connotation.\n\nFitzgerald's palette is vast, yet he chooses to drench his narrative in the hues of gold, green, white, and gray. These colors, initially blank canvases, are imbued with meaning, only to be summoned later to reinforce the significance of crucial objects. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald invests the dichotomy of white and gray with particular import, whispering to the reader the secrets of class and age.\n\nIn the opening pages, the reader is presented with a tableau of whiteness, a sea of purity and refinement. Daisy and Jordan, titans of elegance, move through the narrative swathed in white, their very being an affirmation of the color's association with aristocracy. Even the narrator, Nick Carraway, is not immune to the allure of white, donning \"white flannels\" to attend Gatsby's grand fete. Conversely, Tom, the symbol of solidity and tradition, sports a \"white shirt\" at his encounter with Myrtle, underscoring the color's connection to class and status.\n\nHowever, it is not merely the presence of white that defines its significance. Fitzgerald also employs its absence to create a sense of contrast. As Nick navigates the city, he traverses \"white chasms\" of lower New York, the city's underbelly laid bare. The names of the guests at Gatsby's parties are relegated to a \"gray list,\" their importance diminished by the passage of time. Even the landscape itself is drained of vibrancy, reduced to a \"gray land\" of ashes.\n\nIt is in these moments of subtlety that Fitzgerald's mastery of suggestion is revealed. He coaxes the reader into a world of inference, where meaning is drawn from the shadows. And it is this very subtlety that allows him to strip away the facade of Daisy, reducing her to a mere \"white\" object of desire, a mere addition to Gatsby's ever-growing collection of possessions. The \"gray haze\" of her fur collar, the \"white\" dress she wears before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby – each is a deliberate choice, a thread in the tapestry of meaning that Fitzgerald has so skillfully woven.\n\nIn the end, it is not the explicit statement that reveals the depth of Fitzgerald's craft, but the whispered suggestion, the hint of meaning that lingers in the shadows, waiting to be uncovered by the attentive reader.",
            "The land, a patchwork quilt of chaparral, non-native grasses, and oak woodland, sprawls across the arid expanse like a worn and weathered skin. San Diego County's temperate climate, a gentle benediction of sunshine and moderate rainfall, has rendered this tract a verdant oasis, a fertile cradle for the earthy fruits of labor. Tomatoes, citrus, and leafy greens burst forth from the earth, their verdant shoots a testament to the land's unfettered potential. Peaches and lemons, tree fruits that cling to the branch like the last wisps of dawn's mist, hang heavy with promise. Berries, a tangled skein of sweetness, and peppers, their fiery essence a spark of life, complete the tapestry of this agricultural tapestry. The locals, a throng of devotees to the organic cause, clamor for the taste of this land's bounty, their demand a siren's call that echoes through the hills.\n\nA niche market, a hidden cleft in the market's jagged edge, beckons to the enterprising farmer. The calls for organic, community-supported agriculture resound through the land, a rallying cry that summons the brave and the devoted. Eggs and milk, the pure and unadulterated products of this earth, fetch a premium price, their value a testament to the riches that lie within. And yet, the farmer must navigate the treacherous shoals of cost and profit, a delicate balance that shifts like the sands in an hourglass. The land, a canvas of untold potential, demands a stewardship that is both fierce and gentle, a dance between the competing demands of profit and preservation.\n\nThe land itself, a storied and ancient presence, whispers secrets to those who would listen. For centuries, it has borne witness to the ebb and flow of human endeavor, a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before. Native Americans, their footprints erased by time, left their mark upon this land, a legacy of tradition and lore. Cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers, their names etched upon the pages of history, followed in their footsteps, their presence a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of time.\n\nThis, then, is the land, a canvas of untold potential, a site of ancient power and modern struggle. A farmer, a steward of this earth, must navigate the shifting sands of cost and profit, ever mindful of the delicate balance between the demands of the land and the needs of the market. The government programs, a patchwork of aid and support, beckon to the farmer, a lifeline in the turbulent sea of uncertainty. And yet, the land remains, a constant presence, a reminder of the enduring power of the natural world.\n\nI chose this land, a parcel of 160 acres, situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, a complex web of species and habitat, considers over a hundred species, many of which are endangered or declining. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, their names etched upon the pages of extinction, hang in the balance, their fate a testament to the fragility of life.\n\nThis land, a piece of the original homestead patent, has borne witness to the ebb and flow of human endeavor, its history a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before. The Native Americans, their footprints erased by time, left their mark upon this land, a legacy of tradition and lore. And now, I, a seeker of knowledge, have come to this place, a site of ancient power and modern struggle, to learn from its secrets and to understand the delicate balance between the demands of the land and the needs of the market.",
            "Culture hangs in the balance like an unspoken weight, its presence as palpable as the silence between two men on a dusty road. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what it is not, as much as what it is. A culture is not a singular thing, nor a fixed entity, but a fluid, ever-shifting entity that defies easy categorization. To say that all Russians are stubborn or that all Japanese are accommodating is to oversimplify the labyrinthine complexities of the human experience. The notion that a culture can be reduced to a few fleeting generalities is a folly, a seductive lie that tempts the unwary into the quicksand of misperception.\n\nTo truly grasp the essence of a culture, one must dig deeper, into the rich soil of its history, its prejudices, its very marrow. It is not a matter of judging or seeking to change, but of accepting it for what it is, a force that shapes and is shaped by the negotiations that unfold before us. When we approach a foreign culture, we bring with us the biases of our own, the specter of our own experiences, and the comparisons that inevitably arise are a pale reflection of the reality that lies before us.\n\nTo navigate this treacherous terrain, a negotiator must be willing to listen, to observe, and to learn. He must be attuned to the subtle nuances of body language, the cadence of language, the rhythms of communication that speak to the heart of a culture. For it is not the surface-level trappings of culture that matter, but the deeper currents that shape its very fabric. The traditions, the customs, the values that underpin a culture are the keys to unlocking its essence, and it is these that a negotiator must seek to understand.\n\nAnd yet, culture is not a monolith, a singular entity that can be reduced to a few neat categories. It is a multifaceted gem, cut in a thousand different ways, reflecting the diversity of thought and experience that lies within. A company's culture, for example, may be as varied as the individuals who comprise it, reflecting the values, the attitudes, and the traditions that shape its very being. The dress code, the communication style, the hiring practices – all these and more speak to the culture that resides within, a culture that is as unique as the individuals who inhabit it.\n\nBut values, those bedrock principles that underpin a culture, are the key to unlocking its essence. They speak to the very heart of what drives a culture, the motivations that shape its actions, and the attitudes that inform its decisions. A culture that values saving face, communal harmony, or the pursuit of a hard-driven bargain will act accordingly, and it is the negotiator who understands these values, who can read the signs, who can navigate the complex web of relationships that underpin a culture, who will emerge triumphant.\n\nTo truly succeed in the art of negotiation, one must be willing to strip away the façade, to peer into the depths of a culture, and to emerge with a deeper understanding of its essence. It is a journey that requires patience, empathy, and a willingness to learn, for it is in the unknown, in the uncharted territories of the human experience, that the greatest rewards lie in wait.",
            "In the wilderness of the human heart, a desolate cry echoes forth: \"There is no God.\"  It is a refrain first inscribed in the dusty pages of Psalm 14, a testament to the unyielding skepticism that has long stalked the paths of men.  And so it is, too, with Thomas Aquinas, a voice crying out in the darkness, seeking to illuminate the shadows with the faint glow of reason.  St. Anselm, a precursor to this quest, stood before him, a beacon of faith that cast a different light upon the same desolate landscape.\n\nTo compare the arguments of these two men, we must first accept that they speak of the same God, the God of the Bible, a deity born of blood and fire, of sacrifice and redemption.  To conjure a false idol, a God of our own making, would be to betray the very purpose of their discourse.  And so, we must proceed with the understanding that their words are a testament to their shared conviction, a conviction that we shall dissect with the precision of a surgeon.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument is a labyrinth of introspection, a journey into the very depths of the human soul.  He posits that the existence of God is a truth that can be unearthed within the recesses of our own minds, a truth that cannot be diminished by the weight of empirical evidence.  It is a truth that arises from the dust of our own understanding, a spark that ignites within the darkness.  And so, he writes, we need not look beyond the boundaries of our own consciousness to find the proof of God, for it lies within the very fabric of our being.\n\nBut Thomas Aquinas has a different path to tread.  He is a man of reason, a seeker of logic and evidence.  He believes that the existence of God can be proved, not through the whispers of faith, but through the cold, unforgiving light of reason.  He marshals five arguments, a phalanx of logic that seeks to vanquish the shadows of doubt.  He speaks of change, of causation, of contingency, of degrees of excellence, and of harmony, each a stone in the edifice of his proof.  And in each, he demonstrates the inexorable logic of God's existence, a truth that cannot be denied, a truth that rises from the ashes of human understanding.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of time, a prince emerged, his name lost to the annals of history, yet destined to bear the moniker Buddha, the Awakened One. The weight of his existence bore down upon him like a stone, a burden he would eventually cast aside, like a worn cloak. His footsteps led him down a path of renunciation, into the depths of the self, where the shadows danced with the whispers of impermanence. And there, in the stillness, he found the light, a radiance that illuminated the darkness, and his teachings gave rise to a faith that would spread like a slow-moving tide.\n\nBuddhism, a creed born of his wisdom, now stretches across the expanse of centuries, its contours worn by the touch of time. In the distant land of Sri Lanka, where the Theravada nation holds sway, the ancient rituals persist, a testament to the indomitable will of the faithful. The water-cutting ceremony, a spectacle both mystifying and beautiful, draws participants from all walks of life, a ceremony born not from the words of the Buddha, but from the fertile soil of tradition. It is a reminder that the teachings of the past, like autumn leaves, wither and fade, leaving behind the seeds of a new harvest.\n\nIn this vast and shifting landscape, where the contours of doctrine blur and shift, it is essential to grasp the fundamental principles that underpin the Theravada faith. The triple gem, a trio of sacred pillars, stands steadfast against the tempests of time: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and labyrinthine tapestry, weaves together the threads of the Tripitaka, three baskets of scripture that hold the secrets of the cosmos. The Sutta Pitaka, a repository of the Buddha's words, contains the Suttas, vessels of wisdom; the Vinaya Pitaka, a code of conduct, outlines the rules that govern the lives of the faithful; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a realm of metaphysical mysteries, whispers secrets of the universe, of the fleeting nature of existence, and the illusion of the self.\n\nIn this realm of shadows and light, the concepts of Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca hold sway, their presence a reminder of the impermanence that shapes all things. It is only by recognizing these truths that one may escape the cycle of Sansara, the Samsaric wheel, where desire, hatred, and delusion bind us, like chains to a forgotten past. The Vinaya Pitaka, a code of conduct, outlines the rules that govern the lives of the faithful, a path of moderation and restraint, a balance between the extremes of indulgence and asceticism. For the layman, five precepts serve as a beacon, guiding him along the path of righteousness: to refrain from taking life, from falsehood, from thievery, from licentiousness, and from intoxication. For the monk, a more stringent code, a set of disciplines, serves as a reminder of the gravity of his commitment.\n\nAnd at the very heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths, a quartet of declarations that illuminate the human condition: that life is suffering, that attachment is the source of suffering, that suffering can be overcome, and that the path to liberation lies in the recognition of these truths.",
            "The ravages of time have witnessed a protracted and unyielding enmity between the United States and Mexico, a conflict that scorched the landscape for a span of 57 years, from the ravaged year of 1836 to the dying embers of 1893. The tempests of war, most notably the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, had left an indelible mark upon the soil, as the victor claimed dominion over the newly acquired territories of Texas and the American Southwest. The tumultuous relations between the two nations had been forged in the crucible of conflicting interests, a maelstrom of clashing values and traditions that would not abate until the First World War brought a measure of respite.\n\nThis was no isolated phenomenon, for border nations oft find themselves beset by the same trials, their interests and values pulling them apart like a tectonic fault line. The United States and Mexico, like a pair of weathered adversaries, had been locked in a perpetual struggle, their differences in creed and culture a chasm that seemed insurmountable. As David M. Pletcher observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, intractable American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41), a testament to the enduring nature of their animosity.\n\nThe discord between the two nations was not solely the result of ideological differences, but rather the weight of their colonial past, a legacy of distrust and animosity bequeathed by the English and Spanish. The United States, with its Protestant heritage, had long been wary of the Catholicism that dominated the Mexican heartland, a divide that would prove as insurmountable as the Rio Grande. As Sally Frahm noted, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86), a litany of grievances that would fuel the fires of their animosity.\n\nThe long and winding road to reconciliation was fraught with peril, as the two nations clashed over territorial disputes, border raids, and the lawless expanse of the frontier. Diehl and Goerts (2000) chronicled 17 such disputes, a litany of conflicts that would have been insurmountable were it not for the shifting tides of power and the changing ambitions of the United States. As Schmitt (1974) astutely observed, it was only when Mexico became \"clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" that the rivalry began to abate, its final embers extinguished as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the latter half of the 19th century.",
            "It has been fifteen years since the darkness crept in, a stealthy thief that stole my vitality and left me a shadow of my former self. I was a nurse, a profession born of necessity, a desperate bid to escape the poverty and uncertainty that had long defined my existence. The mantra that echoed through my adolescence, a cold comfort, had been: \"You'll always find work; people will always fall ill.\" And so I chose the path of service, a compromise that would allow me to eke out a living, to scrape by in a world that seemed determined to crush me.\n\nNow, at 46, I am a relic, a spent thing, my bank accounts depleted, my future as uncertain as the wind. Fifteen years of living on the charity of the state have stripped me bare, leaving me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a relentless assault on my very being, a reminder that security, safety, and self-respect are fleeting illusions. And yet, in this desolate landscape, one truth remains: it was the kindness of strangers, the love of family and friends, that sustained me, that allowed me to cling to life.\n\nFor in the face of disaster, be it great or small, we are not strong enough to stand alone. We are fragile, vulnerable, and broken. And so, in this cold, unforgiving world, I implore you: do not place your faith in the empty promises of those who would have you believe that you are sufficient, that you are self-sufficient. Learn to trust in the goodness of others, to ask for help, to offer help. For it was not rugged individualism that carried our forebears across the wilderness, but compassion, respect, and a willingness to share what little they had.\n\nThe Conservatives would have us believe that it was the rugged individualist who built this nation, who carved out a home in the unforgiving vastness. But I know better. I know that it was the shared burdens, the collective struggles, the kindness of strangers that saw us through the darkest of times.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. Store your food and water, stockpile your supplies, and board up your windows. But do not forget the most essential tool of all: the willingness to ask for help, to offer help, to be a neighbor to those around you. For in the end, it is not the preparedness that will see us through, but the human connections that bind us together.",
            "[The darkness that shrouds the labyrinthine paths of evolution.  We seek to unravel the mysteries that govern the trajectory of life, to discern the guiding principles that dictate the course of change.  For even the most skilled of zoologists, the task of defining the organic forms that inhabit our world remains a Sisyphean endeavor, a quest that has been undertaken by few and accomplished by none.  The words of D'Arcy Thompson, spoken in 1917, still echo through the chambers of time: \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\"  And yet, we press on, driven by the faint glimmer of understanding that may be gleaned from the austere beauty of mathematical models.\n\nIn our study, we have set our sights on the humble mollusk, Prunum, and sought to apply the cold, unforgiving logic of mathematical modeling to the study of its skeletogenesis.  Through the application of X-radiographic images and the aid of the software program CerioShell, we have endeavored to quantify the parameters that govern the development of this creature's shell.  Like a topographer charting the unmapped terrain of a foreign land, we have sought to delineate the contours of possible morphological change, to chart the course of evolution through the dark and unforgiving expanse of time.\n\nThe shell, that most wondrous of structures, can be seen as a tube that travels through the 360 degrees of space, a spiral that unwinds through the ages.  The whorls, those successive coils that comprise the shell, are but a testament to the ceaseless drive of the mollusk's growth, a spiral that spirals outward from the central axis, the columella.  And the sutures, those thin lines that separate each whorl, they mark the passage of time, the slow and incremental accumulation of growth.\n\nBut what of the shell's geometry, that most abstract of concepts?  Can we quantify the shape, the form, the very essence of this most wondrous of structures?  Can we chart the trajectory of the aperture, that narrow opening through which the mollusk extends its vulnerable form into the world?  And what of the whorls themselves, those successive coils that comprise the shell?  Can we count them, measure them, and thereby unlock the secrets of the mollusk's development?\n\nWe have sought to answer these questions, to quantify the shape of the shell, to chart the trajectory of the aperture, and to count the whorls.  And in so doing, we have discovered a world of mathematical beauty, a world of abstract forms and geometric shapes.  Like a cartographer charting the unmapped terrain of a foreign land, we have sought to map the contours of the shell, to chart the course of evolution through the dark and unforgiving expanse of time.\n\nOur method, a simple one, yet fraught with complexity.  We view the shell from the apical perspective, that most straightforward of views, and mark the beginning of the first suture.  From this line, we draw a line, and count the whorls, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.  And so, the shell is revealed in all its geometric beauty, a series of apertures that travel through time and space, a spiral that spirals outward from the central axis.\n\nThis trajectory, this path of the aperture, can be graphically and mathematically represented.  And once a mathematical formulation is made, we may vary the parameters, modify the skeletogenesis, and thus unlock the secrets of the mollusk's development.  For in the end, it is not the shell that is the goal, but the understanding that lies within, the understanding of the very essence of life itself.]",
            "The infant's fragile life slipped unnoticed into the abyss, a forgotten statistic lost in the vast expanse of Indonesia's unyielding demographic.  A decade's worth of stagnation had passed, the numbers stubbornly refusing to budge.  The country's forward march towards the Millennium Development Goals was a tale of two trajectories: one of progress, the other of stagnation.  The waters of sanitation had been brought under control, the targets met with a quiet efficiency, but the currents of child and maternal health continued to churn, unmoved by the efforts to stem their tide.  The reasons for this disconnect were many, and the need to shore up the country's health system, rather than merely patching its frayed seams with programmatic interventions, became increasingly clear.\n\nA glimmer of hope flickered in the statistics, a 72% of births attended by skilled hands, the traditional midwives a reminder that even in the most modern of times, the old ways persisted.  But these numbers, too, told a story of untold suffering, of lives lost to the unmet promise of medical intervention.  The hemorrhage that cut short so many lives a silent testament to the limits of midwifery's art.  And the numbers of children under five, their small bodies battered by the relentless onslaught of diarrheal disease, a grim reminder that the fight for their lives was far from won.\n\nThe cesarean section rates, a mere 4%, a statistic that spoke to the deep-seated inequities that ravaged the country's rural heart.  Urban and rural, two worlds apart, the latter a desolate landscape of unmet needs, the former a bastion of privilege.  The 7% in urban settings, a stark contrast to the paltry 2% in rural areas, a stark reminder of the country's failed promise to its most vulnerable citizens.  And the gap, a chasm of 27%, the poorest and richest quintiles worlds apart, their access to healthcare a luxury reserved for the few.\n\nAs the search for solutions continued, the question loomed large: how to close the yawning chasm of service, to bring the healthcare system into the 21st century?  The allure of program-specific approaches, a siren's call to targeted interventions, to cherry-picked solutions, a promise of quick fixes and rapid returns.  But at what cost?  The pitfalls of vertical approaches, the diversion of resources, the hemorrhage of funding from other areas, the siphoning off of human capital, the duplication of services, the labyrinthine paperwork, the suffocating complexity.  The example of HIV/AIDS, a cautionary tale of the unintended consequences of programmatic zeal, the family planning sector a casualty of the international community's misplaced priorities.",
            "In the shadow of the Victorian era, two novels stood apart from the grand tapestry of their brethren - Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Like specters, they loomed, their darkness a counterpoint to the gilded opulence that defined their time.  These works, born of a fevered imagination, bore the scars of a world in flux, where the boundaries between reality and madness were but a whispered secret.  In them, the author's masterful hand wove a tapestry of mystery, an intricate dance of the bizarre and the unknown.\n\nAs the protagonist, Oliver Twist, stumbled through the labyrinthine streets of London, the cacophony of his mind threatened to consume him whole.  The words of Sikes and Crackit still echoed in his ears, a maddening refrain that threatened to unravel the very fabric of his sanity.  And then, like a crack of thunder on a summer's day, the sound of firearms shattered the air, sending a chill through his very marrow.  In the depths of his mind, a maelstrom of visions swirled, a kaleidoscope of light and sound that threatened to dash him to the rocks of despair.  Through it all, a thread of pain ran, a constant heartbeat that tormented him, a reminder that in this world, he was but a fragile, helpless thing.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dream sequences - these glimpses into the abyss - served as a window into the soul of the protagonist.  They revealed the depths of his pain, the terrors that haunted him, and the crushing weight of his ignorance.  When, in chapter 28, Oliver relived the trauma of the shooting, it was as if the very fabric of time had been torn apart, revealing the raw, pulsing wound beneath.  The passage was a brutal reminder of the fragility of life, of the helplessness that lay at its core.  For in that moment, Oliver was but a leaf on the wind, blown about by the whims of fate, his senses dulled, his will shattered.  And in that darkness, the question arose: whose hand had guided him to this place of despair?  Was it his own, or some malevolent force that had seized him, guiding him down a path from which he could not escape?\n\nThe day passed - a fleeting moment, a whispered secret, lost in the shadows.  It was gone, consumed by the endless night, a night that seemed to stretch on forever, a cavernous chasm filled with the whispers of the damned.  And in that darkness, Oliver's fate was sealed, a destiny that seemed to stretch out before him like a cold, unforgiving stone.",
            "The memories of those afternoons spent amidst the sterile glow of fluorescent lights still linger, a faint haze that clings to the skin like the lingering chill of a winter's breeze. It was there, in that desolate landscape of learning, that I chanced upon the tale of Adrian, a boy shrouded in an enigma. His struggle with the written word was a riddle, one that I, with my halting grasp of the alphabet, was powerless to decipher. The letters danced before his eyes, a maddening jumble of sounds and symbols, their meaning lost to him. His English was flawless, a smooth current that flowed effortlessly from his lips, yet his reading was a jarring discord, a cacophony of sounds that defied comprehension.\n\nIt was only when his mother arrived, a woman who spoke in a language that was a foreign tongue to me, that the truth began to unravel. Like a thread pulled loose from a tapestry, the mystery of Adrian's struggles began to reveal itself. His mother's presence was a reminder that the language barrier is a chasm that runs deep, a gulf that separates the world of sound from the world of sense. And it was there, in that moment, that I realized the gravity of the problem: even for those who speak the language with ease, the act of reading can be a daunting task.\n\nThe issue is a canker that festers in the marrow of our education system, a wound that refuses to heal. The solutions, like so many bandages, offer only temporary respite from the pain. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – each one a fragmented attempt to stem the tide of linguistic confusion. And yet, like a river that flows unimpeded, the problem persists.\n\nBut what if we were to approach this issue with a different perspective? What if we were to see the dual language system not as a luxury, but as a necessity? Studies have shown that children enrolled in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers, their minds sharpened by the demands of navigating two languages. The fear of wasting resources, the fear of the unknown, is a specter that haunts our decision-makers. But it is a fear born of ignorance. For if we were to apply this approach on a grand scale, to make it the rule rather than the exception, the benefits would be felt by all.\n\nBut how do we make this a reality? Do we require our teachers to be bilingual, to walk the tightrope of two languages with ease? No, that would be an impossible task, a burden that would drive even the most dedicated educators to despair. But what if we were to provide them with the tools they need? What if we were to offer them the aid of bilingual tutors, language specialists who could bridge the gap between the world of sound and the world of sense?\n\nThe answer lies not in one solution, but in a multitude of approaches, each one a thread in the tapestry of language. It is a complex problem, one that requires a multifaceted solution. But it is a problem that can be solved, if we are willing to approach it with a willingness to learn, to adapt, and to evolve.",
            "The notion of something greater than ourselves is a notion that haunts us from the earliest breaths of our lives. Some of us are shorn of this truth at the altar of Sunday's sabbath, others in the hallowed halls of temples, and still, others within the labyrinthine recesses of their own minds. We are told that which we cannot see, that which lies beyond the reach of our grasping hands, is a thing of beauty, a thing of awe. But some among us reject the handed-down dogma, spurning the notion that there can be a truth greater than our own fleeting perceptions. We flit from one creed to another like moths to a flame, never quite finding our bearings in the darkness.\n\nMy father's eyes, sunken and worn, stared out into the rain as we sat on the creaking porch of our weathered house. The rain drummed against the tin roof, a relentless cadence that seemed to echo the pounding of my own heart. The gutters, swollen with rain, drowned the parched plants that clung to the edge of the porch like supplicants to a cruel god. His voice, a low murmur, spoke of cardinals, of their song, of their beauty. But his eyes, they told a tale of weariness, of a soul beset by the ravages of time. His frame, gaunt and skeletal, seemed to defy the very notion of vitality. I felt a shiver run down my spine, a sense of foreboding that I dare not speak, for to speak would be to acknowledge the abyss that yawned before us.\n\nHe passed on in the cold decay of winter, five days shy of my twenty-second winter's birth. The chemo and radiation, a cruel jest, had prolonged his suffering, stretching out the agony like a rusty wire. What purpose, I wondered, lay in this prolongation? Was it merely a cruel trick, a jest played by some capricious deity? I thought of God, of gods, but knew that they had long since turned their faces away from mine. In the dark of night, I spat out prayers, a futile gesture, an offering to a god that had long since abandoned me.\n\nI had not wanted to witness his passage, to bear witness to the dissolution of the man who had given me life. I had not wanted to see the light fade from his eyes, to watch as the vitality drained from his frame. I knew him better than they, better than his family, and I knew that he would not have wished for me to be a spectator to his demise. I curled up in a ball, a fetal position, and waited for the news, for the cold certainty that would seal my fate.\n\nBut the silence was deafening. No voice, no word, no gentle touch to ease the blow. Only the stillness, a heavy, oppressive stillness that seemed to suffocate me.",
            "In the labyrinthine heart of the literary canon, a paradoxical creature stirs, its essence an oxymoron of antiquity and innovation: the Gothic novel. Ian Watt's astute observation in The Rise of the Gothic Novel has it that this enigmatic form is, in truth, an \"Old-New\" monstrosity, a creature of contradictions that has been both reviled and revered for its alleged lack of depth and its capacity to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The inaugural attempt at this peculiar genre, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, contrived a new method of literary expression by welding the worn, theatrical elements of a bygone era to the nascent, mimetic art of the modern novel. In doing so, Walpole forged a narrative that would become synonymous with the Gothic, its pages infused with the musty scent of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition.\n\nThe term \"Gothic,\" at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, was a cipher, a label affixed to disparate peoples, styles, and epochs, each carrying the taint of archaism and unsophistication in the face of an increasingly modernizing world. Yet it was precisely this oxymoronic fusion – the ancient and the modern – that allowed the Gothic to endure, to persist in its obsolescence, and to present itself anew to each successive generation, a perpetual stranger in a strange land.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic tropes, a leitmotif that courses through the veins of this peculiar genre, is the notion of chivalry. The medieval ideal of the knight, that paragon of valor, honor, and competence, is both preserved and transmuted in Walpole's inaugural Gothic novel. This fetishization of chivalry served as a potent counterpoint to the perceived decay of virtue in the society of Walpole's day, a world beset by politics, faction, and controversy. Through the deployment of chivalric motifs and mannerisms, the Gothic past was transformed into a realm of idealized romance, a fantasy of a bygone era that would serve as a corrective to the perceived shortcomings of the present.\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous era, Walpole's The Castle of Otranto arose, a cri de coeur from a writer beset by the troubles of his time. His characters, those shadowy figures that populate the novel's gothic landscape, embody the chivalric ideals that Walpole saw as lost in his own society. Frederic, that enigmatic prince, is a case in point, his description replete with the trappings of chivalry: a prince, a man of noble birth, beset by tragedy, and said to have fallen to the infidels. His image is an exaggeration, a distortion of the chivalric ideal, a testament to the excesses that would come to define the Gothic genre.",
            "In the desolate expanse of commerce, a labyrinthine dance of goods unfolds, a Sisyphean task of moving the raw materials from the depths of the customer's desire through the crucible of supply, production, and distribution. The term \"supply chain management\" was birthed in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a man who would chart the course of this arduous journey. He described the grand tapestry of planning, implementing, and controlling the intricate web of processes that bind the supply chain together, a symphony of efficiency and satisfaction.\n\nSix pillars stand as the bedrock of this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The masterful manipulation of these elements is the domain of the manager, a conductor guiding the orchestra of commerce towards the sublime goal of customer satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the initial step in this odyssey, is the foundation upon which the entire edifice is built. It is here that the when, why, where, and how of creation are determined, a delicate balance of art and science. The manager must first divine the desires of the customer, a task that requires gazing into the abyss of the market, a vast and unforgiving expanse that holds the secrets of demand and desire. Once the market's whispers have been deciphered, the manager must decide what products shall be born, and in what quantity, a decision that holds the power to shape the very fabric of the supply chain.\n\nThe location of production is a decision of utmost importance, a choice that must be made with the customer's satisfaction in mind. The manager must weigh the options, balancing the scales of volume and quality, as the fate of the product hangs precariously in the balance. And once the location has been determined, the manager must turn their attention to the scheduling of workloads and the maintenance of equipment, a Sisyphean task that requires ceaseless vigilance.\n\nSupply, the second pillar of this edifice, is a realm of strategic decision-making, where the core capabilities of a facility are determined and partnerships are forged. A company may be a vast, sprawling entity, with multiple divisions working in tandem to create a single product. The manager must navigate this Byzantine landscape, determining which division is best suited to each task, and whether to outsource to other companies, a choice that holds the power to create velocity, that elusive goal of quality and flexibility at a reduced cost.\n\nIn this intricate dance, every detail is vital, a single misstep threatening to unravel the entire web of commerce. The examples of Wal-Mart and Target, two retail behemoths, illustrate the importance of outlining processes, a choreographed ballet of efficiency and expectation. Without this careful planning, the whole edifice risks collapse, a descent into chaos and confusion.",
            "A desolate sign, scrawled on a piece of cardboard held aloft by Ellen Page's lone figure, made its claim: \"Hitler lives in Burma\". The words, scoured into the surface with a Sharpie's coarse tip, seemed a travesty against the verdant backdrop of Myanmar's cities. Yet, in a place where the tattered remnants of democracy clung to life like a worn shroud, such a pronouncement was not without precedent. \n\nIn this, the Southeastern Asian nation's tortured history, the junta's iron grip had ruled since '62, its ascent born of blood and coup. And in '07, a spark of resistance flared, a flame that would be known as the Saffron Revolution, its name taken from the saffron robes of the monks who led the charge. The protests, a rarity in a decade of silence, slowly gathered momentum, drawing in the public's attention like moths to a dying flame. But the government's tolerance wore thin, its patience exhausted by the people's defiance. The violence that followed was a maelstrom, with the military laying waste to monasteries and foreign journalists rounded up, their cameras and notebooks seized, their bodies silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, met his end on a street corner, his crime a simple presence at a protest. The official tally of dead stood at 13, a figure that Colonel Hla Win, a man who had defected from the junta's ranks, would later dispute, his words a whispered truth in a world where lies were currency. \"Many more,\" he said, \"have perished in the shadows, their bodies lost to the wind and the dust.\"\n\nIt is a refrain that echoes through the ages, a litany of horror and bloodshed, a testament to the human heart's capacity for cruelty. From the Roman emperors, who claimed the gods as their patrons, to the Japanese emperors, who were said to be gods themselves, and the leaders of our own time, who speak in hushed tones of their divine right to rule. The examples are legion, a litany of violence and oppression that spans centuries: Tiananmen's Square, where students and intellectuals clashed with the Chinese government's iron fist; the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militiamen, backed by their government, slaughtered Tutsis and moderates alike; and the Third Reich, a dark chapter in human history, where the very notion of humanity was warped and distorted.",
            "In the shadow of Duke Ellington's extended lifespan, a legacy arose like a slow-burning ember that suffused the jazz world with an unyielding brilliance. The piano's subtle whispers in his compositions belied a creative force that honed the individual talents of his orchestra, shaping them into a cohesive unit that danced with precision and abandon. Ellington's mastery of the ensemble's inner workings allowed him to craft frameworks for soloists to unfurl their improvisations, alongside tightly-wound phrases that conjured the unique timbres of each musician. His ear was a sieve, sifting through the disparate sounds to distill a singular tone that animated each piece, imbuing them with a sense of purpose and coherence.\n\nThe Creole Love Call, an early exemplar of Ellington's innovations, stands as testament to his audacious use of voice as a jazz instrument. This slow-burning twelve-bar blues, with its six choruses, slowly unwinds like a parched landscape after a summer storm. The first chorus unfurls a call-and-response dialogue between voice and reeds, the voice's smooth melodic lines giving way to a rougher, more guttural timbre towards its end. The second chorus unfolds like a dark, sweeping cloud, the muted trumpet solo a somber elegy that subsides into a quiet reverie. In the third, a clarinet solo soars in the upper register, its syncopated piano accompaniment a subtle undercurrent that underscores the music's fluid tensions. The full band echoes the first chorus in the fourth, the brass and reed sections trading calls and responses like the gentle lapping of waves against a deserted shore.\n\nIn the fifth chorus, the reeds take the lead, their high-register calls and responses punctuated by the staccato bursts of the brass and rhythm sections, like the sharp, staccato beat of a desert wind. And in the final chorus, the voice reverts to its earlier, smooth timbre, its growling, instrumental quality a testament to Ellington's sorcery in bending the human voice to the service of his music. A final, brief tag concludes the piece, a vocal run and dissonant novelty ending that hangs like a whispered secret in the music's fading embers.\n\nHot and Bothered, recorded a year later, further showcases Ellington's deft orchestration and his ear for tone color. Here, \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing entwine in a call-and-response phrase, their vocal and instrumental aspects commingling in a rich, complementary whole. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends this idea, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introducing the melody with a wistful, melancholic air that draws the listener inexorably into the music's depths.",
            "A void had gnawed within her, a hunger that refused to be sated. It had begun to manifest itself when she was still a girl, a spark of discontent that flickered to life like a flame in the darkness. By the time the weight of seventeen summers had settled upon her shoulders, the emptiness had taken on a shape, a yearning for connection that refused to be assuaged. Yet, the faces that swirled around her, the boys who offered their awkward solicitations, held no allure, no siren's call that could lure her in. She pondered the enigma, a riddle that refused to yield its secrets, and wondered if she was cursed, if some affliction had been visited upon her.\n\nAt home, the days unwound in a tranquil rhythm, the only discordant note the occasional friction between her own wild spirit and the calm that reigned over her parents. They were a gentle couple, their love a flame that burned bright and true, but her own fire, a conflagration of laughter and rebellion, threatened to scorch the garden of their serenity. Today, however, was not a day of quietude. As she moved through the rooms, a disturbance in the air, a discordant note that threatened to shatter the stillness. A scream, her mother's voice, cut through the silence like a knife, and she rushed to the kitchen, her heart racing with fear.\n\nIn the kitchen, her mother lay on the floor, a crumpled figure, her voice a low, anguished mewling. \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to...the hospital.\" The words were torn from her lips, a plea that spoke to the depths of her pain. Her daughter rushed to her side, her hand a steadying presence, and lifted her, cradling her as if she were a child. \"Where can I find you, Mom?\" The mother's hands, trembling, pointed the way, and she carried her, a weight that was both fragile and precious, to the car.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent, a stench of sickness and fear, enveloped her like a shroud, but she was unfazed, her mind fixed on her mother's fragile form. She laid her on a gurney, called out to the doctors, and watched as they sprang into action, their faces set with concern. The sounds of the hospital, a cacophony of beeps and murmurs, swirled around her, but she was oblivious, her focus solely on her mother's suffering. It was a fall, a simple accident, her mother had said, a vase from the top shelf, a stepping stool, and a sudden, precipitous drop. But to her, it was a small miracle that her mother was alive, a reminder that life was a fragile, brittle thing, and that the spaces between breaths were all that stood between us and the abyss.",
            "In a vast expanse of time, where the rhythms of existence are governed by the whims of the heart, a phenomenon had come to light - that the adherence to a certain way of eating, a diet born of the Mediterranean sun, might hold the power to ward off the specter of chronic heart disease and stroke, those twin harbingers of mortality. This was the premise of a study, one that would seek to quantify the relationship between the \"Mediterranean Diet\" and the scourge of cardiovascular afflictions.\n\nThe diet in question, a modified iteration of the original, had come to be known as the \"alternate Mediterranean\" or \"aMed\" diet. It was characterized by a preponderance of plant-based sustenance - the verdant bounty of fruits, the richness of nuts, the wholesome goodness of whole grains and legumes - alongside an abundance of monounsaturated fats, the gentle solace of fish, and the sparing use of animal products and saturated fats. A moderate indulgence in the fleeting pleasures of alcohol was also permitted.\n\nPrevious studies, those diligent sentinels of the medical community, had long since noted an inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. One intervention trial, a bold experiment in the art of dietetics, had even shown the Mediterranean diet to be a more potent ally in the fight against weight loss and the regulation of cholesterol levels in the obese. However, these studies had neglected to focus on the specter of stroke, that most insidious of afflictions.\n\nThis epidemiological study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of data, followed a cohort of 74,886 women, women who had been drawn into the orbit of the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and venerable project that had been monitoring the health of 121,700 female nurses across 11 states for nigh on two decades. Over the course of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers had computed an aMed diet score for these women, using a series of self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" that had been designed to capture the nuances of their dietary habits.\n\nThe questionnaire, that most intimate of instruments, had been subjected to validation studies, its efficacy in capturing the subtleties of nutritional intake having been rigorously tested. Reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke, those most grievous of afflictions, had been confirmed through a meticulous review of medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Where these records had been absent, cases had been deemed \"probable\" and included, a necessary concession to the imperfections of the human record.\n\nA host of other factors, those confounding variables that can distort the truth of a study, had been accounted for: body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity had been assessed, a vital component in the calculus of health.\n\nTo reduce the random variation that can beset the data, the researchers had computed cumulative averages of the aMed score, averaging together scores from two prior years. This had allowed them to capture the long-term dietary habits of the women, to tease out the signal from the noise.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical technique of rare elegance, had been employed to assess the association between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke. Separate models had been used for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke, a nuanced approach that had allowed the researchers to tease out the subtleties of the relationship.\n\nAnd so it was found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected in a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in women. Over the course of 20 years, 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths had been recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile, those who had most closely approximated the ideals of the Mediterranean diet, were at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In the depths of a country beset by insatiable greed and short-sightedness, a calamity of unyielding ferocity befell the United States of America in the year 2007. A maelstrom of unemployment, a housing market reduced to ruin, and behemoths of corporate industry brought low - the particulars of this national convulsion still linger in the dark recesses of our collective memory. It is a question, then, that demands an answer: how did this cataclysm unfold, and what might be done to stem its aftershocks? The malady, in its essence, was born of unwholesome decisions, a concatenation of selfish and naive actions that coaxed banks and financial titans into issuing sub-prime loans to those who should not have been granted such favor, into a financial infrastructure woefully unprepared to support the weight of such an endeavor.\n\nThe government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were similarly ensnared, their mandate to underwrite and repackage these dubious mortgages into CDO's and CDS's a Faustian bargain that would come to haunt them. As the borrowers defaulted on these ill-fated loans, the banks found themselves bereft of capital reserves, and the contagion was thus spread to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and on to the economy at large.\n\nThe roots of this calamity run deep, to the year 1999, when the Clinton administration, driven by a hunger for re-election, loosened the reins of lending, sowing the seeds of a sub-prime crisis that would germinate seven years later. In a prescient article published in that same year, Steven Holmes of the New York Times foresaw the perils of this course of action: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people, and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes's words, a Cassandra's warning, prophesied the very fate that would befall the nation: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nA multitude of factors contributed to the economy's precipitous decline, not the least of which was the Byzantine complexity of the mortgage market itself. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) - each a puzzle piece in the grand edifice of financial sorcery - entwined the economy in a Gordian knot, leaving households and financial markets perilously over-leveraged, vulnerable to the slightest tremors in the housing market.\n\nAnd then, the inevitable occurred: the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the ruin they had wrought. The top five U.S. investment banks, their coffers drained by $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, a staggering 30% of the nation's GDP, were left to pick up the pieces. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, their mortgage debt a staggering $5 trillion, were placed under government control in September 2008, a grim testament to the hubris of a system that had forgotten the lesson of its own mortality.",
            "In the desolate expanse of narrative, there exists a place where the writer's voice grows weak, where the words blur together like dust swirling in the wind.  It is the province of exposition, a pitfall that can swallow the reader whole, leaving only a faint recollection of having been there.  Dr. Merlin's fingers dance across the keyboard, her eyes scanning the screen with a mixture of frustration and despair as she succumbs to the siren's call of Too Much Information.\n\nExposition is a specter that haunts the writer, a whisper in the ear that urges haste, that promises to condense the tale into something palatable, something digestible.  It is not a friend, but a foe that saps the life from the story, leaving it a hollow shell of what it once was.  The \"Show, don't tell\" mantra echoes through the chambers of the writer's mind, a reminder of the dangers of indulging in the excesses of exposition.\n\nConsider the example of the heroine, her meeting with her beloved a distant memory, a moment lost in the haze of time.  The author's words, once meant to breathe life into this encounter, instead suffocate it, stifling the reader's connection to the characters.  The husband's character is introduced in a blur, a mere outline of a man, his love for his wife reduced to a few hastily scribbled lines of dialogue.  The reader is given no reason to mourn his passing, no insight into the bond that tied him to his wife, no glimpse into the depths of their relationship.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the writer's words are the only respite from the void.  It is here that the author must provide the meat, the substance that gives the story its weight.  To rush past the details, to gloss over the intricacies of character, is to risk losing the reader forever.  The temptation is great, the allure of brevity and concision a siren's call that beckons the writer to sacrifice depth for the sake of expediency.  But it is in the slow, deliberate dance of exposition that the writer must find the rhythm of the story, the beat that gives it life.\n\nAs the writer sits, fingers poised over the keyboard, the specter of exposition looms large, a constant reminder of the dangers of excess.  It is a temptation that must be resisted, a pitfall that must be avoided.  For it is in the act of creation that the writer finds true power, in the slow, deliberate dance of words that bring the story to life.",
            "I watched the morning broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on that sweltering August 13, 2011. The NBC 4 news had presented a story that seemed an anomaly in its brevity - a tale of a man named Shad Hostettler who had laid low in a frenzy of bloodlust, his wife the victim of his hand. The images of him, taken in the aftermath of his arrest, spoke of a man consumed by some dark and primal urge. The broadcaster devoted but a fleeting moment to this unfolding tragedy, as if the weight of it were too much to bear. Yet, in the cold calculus of the telecast, two minutes was a sufficing allotment for a life shattered.\n\nThe next story, too, seemed a pale shadow of its brethren. A youth, Travis Buyers, 18, had been cut down in the Sharon Woods, his body ravaged by the ravages of violence. The authorities had yet to ensnare the perpetrator, and the trail was growing cold. The city's SWAT team navigated the darkened streets, searching for answers that seemed, to the naked eye, elusive. I could not help but notice the economy with which this story was told, its brevity a stark reminder of the manner in which the city's underbelly is oftentimes shrouded in silence.\n\nA third story, that of a Med-Flight helicopter riddled by the slugs of a .22 caliber rifle, served as a stark reminder of the city's violence. A reward, five thousand dollars, was offered for any information that might lead to the capture of the perpetrator. It was a paltry sum, a token gesture in a city where the value of life seemed to be measured in the most crass of terms.\n\nThe forecaster's words, a litany of rain and thunderstorms, served as a jarring counterpoint to the tales of violence that had preceded it. The city would be beset by the elements, the temperatures a steady mid-eighties, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, nature's indifference remains a constant.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF, perpetrated by a dark-skinned man, his features obscured by a hoodie, served as a stark reminder of the manner in which the city's underclass is oftentimes reduced to a composite sketch. The details of his appearance seemed an afterthought, a mere embellishment to an already gruesome tale.\n\nLastly, the story of Rene Rodriguez, a man convicted of trafficking marijuana from Texas to Ohio, served as a testament to the city's eternal fascination with the darker corners of human existence. His sentence, a staggering 300 months, seemed a number plucked from the ether, a cipher that spoke to the city's own moral calculus. His ethnicity, a mere aside, a footnote to a tale that seemed, at its core, a story of the human condition.",
            "The bond between brothers is a rope of twisted threads, torn and frayed, yet unyielding in its grasp. It weaves together a tapestry of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, a brocade of contradictions that can never be unraveled. In the crucible of hardship, the nature of this bond is revealed, its true face a twisted visage of good and evil. The cost of these emotions is a burden that must be borne, a weight that presses down upon the shoulders of those who dare to love and be loved. It is in the depths of this bond that one sees the unvarnished truth, a reflection of oneself in the eyes of another, a mirror held up to the soul. In the actions and their consequences, a man's character is forged, like iron in the fire.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is laid bare, a tale of two brothers set against a backdrop of a lush, unforgiving landscape. Theirs is a journey of bitter disappointment and unyielding pride, a reckoning that ends in blood and dust. The narrator's gaze is a microscope, laying bare the complexities of the human heart, the tangled web of emotions that drives us forward. The protagonist's actions, a litany of resentment and love, are a testament to the power of this bond.\n\nHis was a dream of a brother, a companion to share in the wild joys of youth, to run and jump and climb the vines of Old Woman Swamp. But Doodle's fragile heart, a ticking time bomb, made such dreams a distant memory. The protagonist's anger and frustration seethed like a pot left unwatched, a slow-burning fire that threatened to consume them both. He had considered the unthinkable, a dark thought that lurked in the recesses of his mind, a monstrous impulse that recoiled in shame. Yet, in Doodle's smile, a spark of hope flickered to life, a flame that warmed the cold stone of his heart. It was a fleeting moment, a glimpse of the love that lay beneath the surface, a love that would ultimately be the protagonist's undoing.",
            "In the vast and labyrinthine recesses of the human cranium, a maelstrom of activity stirs, a dizzying vortex of thought and perception. The ancients, in their nascent understanding, likened the mind to a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a tome bound in worn leather, and finally, to the cold, calculating machinery of the computer. But these metaphors, like wisps of smoke on the wind, are fleeting and treacherous, apt to lead us astray with their simplistic certainties.\n\nThe process begins with the sensory organs, those sensitive antennae that drink in the world around us – the tactile thrum of skin, the warmth of sunlight, the cacophony of sound, the radiance of light. From these primal sensations, a cascade of electrochemical signals unfurls, like a river bursting forth from its source. The brain, a maze of twisted pathways and hidden chambers, processes this information with a logic both elegant and brutal, oscillating between the bottom-up and top-down currents of perception.\n\nConsider, for instance, the fleeting image of a black box on a white background. The bottom-up torrent, like a torrent of rainwater, gathers in the simplest elements – the color, the orientation, the borders that define the shape – and from these, the mind constructs the box. But top-down, the more considered, more deliberate process, overlays this nascent perception with the weight of prior knowledge, guiding the recognition of the box as a thing, rather than a mere void.\n\nAnd yet, the brain's attention, a filter thin as a veil, determines which signals are worthy of consideration, which are relegated to the shadows. We may perceive each blade of grass beneath our feet, but only the urgent whisper of our name, in a world of din and noise, holds our attention. The brain's pathways, like a labyrinth, twist and turn, with each step, each decision, modulating the flow of information, a perpetual dance of give and take.\n\nBut how is this information stored, this flux of perception and understanding? There are the chambers of memory, a vast and labyrinthine repository of experience and knowledge. And within these chambers, the processes of encoding and maintenance unfold. The sensory stimuli, like tokens in a game, are inscribed with meaning – the structural tracing of words, the phonemic echoes of sound, the semantic resonance of meaning. And once stored, this knowledge must be maintained, sustained by the ephemeral electrical signals that pulse through the neural networks, a fleeting, flickering spark of life.\n\nThere are those who propose models of the mind's organization, theories born of observation and conjecture. The semantic network, a web of connections, a vast and intricate tapestry, posits that concepts are nodes, linked by threads of association – \"chair\" to \"table,\" \"table\" to \"wooden,\" and so on. But these models, like the metaphors that precede them, are but fragile approximations, pale reflections of the mind's infinite complexity.",
            "In the desolate expanse of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley conjures a dystopian nightmare born of the unholy trinity of technology, capitalism, and the insidious World State. The denizens of this godforsaken world are reduced to mere pawns, their every whim catered to, their desires shaped by the cold, calculating hand of the World Controller. Community supplants individuality, a hollow substitute for the authentic self, and the pursuit of happiness becomes a mindless, vacant drone, a parody of the human experience.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist dialectics, the façade of this supposed utopia reveals its true colours: a suffocating web of ideological control, where the few, the privileged and the powerful, manipulate the many, the voiceless and the downtrodden. The lexicon of Marxism – homogeny, reification, false consciousness – echoes through the narrative, a litany of condemnation for the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. The conditioning of the populace, a relentless drumbeat of hypnopædia, numbs the senses, rendering the lower classes impotent, their wills reduced to mere acquiescence, as they are driven to consume, to spend, to indulge.\n\nThe notion of hegemony writ large, where the dominant class holds sway over all, is starkly apparent in Brave New World. The upper echelons, the Alphas and Betas, are complicit in their own oppression, their privilege a shield against the weight of their culpability. Few, like Bernard, dare to question the status quo, while the rest remain enthralled, their senses dulled by the relentless barrage of consumerist propaganda.\n\nRelationships in this bleak world are reduced to a mere facade, a shallow masquerade of human connection. The characters, even the ostensibly prominent ones, are one-dimensional, their depths unexplored, their emotions stunted. Love, passion, and true connection are nonexistent, replaced by the hollow, vacuous interactions that masquerade as human experience. The men's comments on women are reduced to lascivious, reductionist remarks, while the women's thoughts are a litany of shallow, self-aggrandizing musings. The complacency of the societal classes, their acceptance of their predetermined roles, is a stark indictment of the dehumanizing effects of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, the proletariat, conditioned to believe in their own superiority, toil in ignorance, their chains forged from the very ideologies that bind them. The World State, that behemoth of capitalist machinations, has succeeded in reducing humanity to a state of acquiescence, a sea of faceless, soulless drones, their thoughts, their desires, their very humanity, reduced to nothing more than a distant memory.",
            "The desolate expanse of University Park, a landscape of concrete and steel, stretches out before me like an unforgiving vastness. Four and a half semesters have passed since I first set foot on this unforgiving terrain, and still, the perils of navigating its twisted paths persist. As a freshman, I was consigned to the farthest reaches of East Halls, a dormitory huddled on the eastern extremity of campus, its isolation a testament to the indifference of a behemoth institution. The meager confines of Stuart Hall, my erstwhile home, seemed a world away from the hallowed halls of Willard, where the distant din of learning echoed through the corridors. The journey between these disparate points, a meandering odyssey of 25 minutes on foot, was a tribulation best faced on the most clement of days. And even then, the threat of inclement weather loomed, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of this place. But the truth, like the wind that whispers through the trees, was that the East Halls had once stood apart, a solitary outpost on the outskirts of campus. The intervening years have seen the intervening lands transformed into a tangle of sports fields, monolithic buildings, and residential monoliths, a testament to the inexorable expansion of this sprawling metropolis.\n\nAnd so, the problem persists, a Sisyphean task of traversing this unforgiving landscape. The bicycle, a humble steed, offers a glimmer of hope in this desolate expanse. But it is a tool, a mere instrument, and one that requires the user to be willing to utilize it. The campus, too, must be remade in its image, a topography that acknowledges the needs of its most vulnerable travelers. The words of a fellow traveler, a friend who had lately rediscovered the joys of pedaling, still lingered in my mind. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, his voice laced with conviction, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And so, I found myself drawn to the bicycle, a siren's call in a sea of concrete.\n\nAs I navigated the twisted roads of Pollock, a ribbon of asphalt that stretched before me like a gauntlet, I was reminded of the perils of this existence. The bike, once a novelty, had become an indispensable adjunct to my daily routine. The 25-minute walk to Thomas building, a veritable eternity in the eyes of a student, was reduced to a mere 5 minutes of pedaling fury. But the road, a cruel mistress, was unforgiving, her twists and turns a constant threat to the unwary cyclist. And yet, I pressed on, driven by the knowledge that without this trusty steed, I would be at the mercy of the pedestrian's plodding pace. The hours, like grains of sand in an hourglass, would slip away, lost to the void of walking, a Sisyphean task that would consume my very existence. No, the bicycle was my only solace, a fragile lifeline in a sea of concrete and steel."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle.

Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",

If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The path I have chosen to pursue is a hard one, a winding road that threads its way through the darkest reaches of human suffering. It is a journey into the heart of the Division of Family and Children Services, where the wounds of abuse and neglect run deep. It is here that I intend to make my stand, a solitary figure in a world of shattered lives. The values that guide me are few, but they burn like embers in the darkness: service, a steadfast commitment to the welfare of others; respect, a profound reverence for the inherent dignity of every human soul; an ethical nature, a determination to walk the narrow path of right and wrong; and a commitment to the ceaseless pursuit of self-improvement, that I might remain a instrument of healing in a world that so often seems bent on destruction.\n\nFor years, I wandered, lost in a wilderness of uncertainty, unsure of the purpose that drove me. I watched as those around me turned away from the abyss, their faces averted from the abyss of human suffering. But I saw it, this abyss, and it haunted me. It was in these moments of clarity that I knew I had to act, to take up the burden of another's pain. I turned to the study of Psychology, a discipline that would allow me to grasp the complexities of the human heart. But even with this knowledge, I remained uncertain, a leaf blown by the wind. It was not until I witnessed the fragile form of a sixteen-year-old boy, his eyes wide with fear, that I knew my path was set. He had fled his home, desperate to escape the cruelty that lurked within its walls. I saw in him a reflection of the darkness that lurked within myself, a reminder that I too had been lost, that I too had known the sting of abandonment.\n\nIt was in this moment that I knew I had to act, to take up the mantle of a social worker. I drove to the boy's parents' house, my heart heavy with foreboding. The police were there, their faces a mask of indifference. I poured out my concerns to them, my words a plea to the void. They listened, their expressions unreadable. And then I spoke to the parents, their eyes averted, their words a tangled web of deceit. I saw in them the same darkness that I had seen in the boy, the same cruelty that had driven him to flee.\n\nThis experience shook me to my core. It was then that I knew I had to dedicate myself to the pursuit of social justice, to stand against the tide of oppression that threatened to consume us all. I had always known that I was different, that I refused to be bound by the constraints of societal expectations. I had protested, in my own small way, against the injustices that I saw around me. I had dyed my hair, worn clothes that spoke to my soul, pierced my ears, and stood against the tide of homophobia, racism, and discrimination. And now, in this moment of clarity, I knew that I had to continue this fight, to stand against the forces of oppression that threatened to consume us all.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a affliction that shrouds the mind and body in an impenetrable darkness - insomnia. This malady, born of the complexities of the biological and sociocultural, defies easy categorization, its tendrils creeping into the very fabric of our existence. The biological model, a cold and unforgiving mistress, seeks to unravel the Gordian knot of genetic predisposition and physiological imperatives that govern our slumber. The hypothalamus, a seat of primal urges and instincts, holds sway over the delicate balance of sleep and wakefulness, its neurons whispering ancient secrets to the insomniac's fevered brain.\n\nA study, conducted in the sterile confines of a laboratory, peered into the recesses of the mice's neural realm, where the orexin neurons, like sentinels of the dark, ruled over the kingdom of sleep. The presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons, a genetic legacy that echoes through the ages, held the key to the mystery of slumber. The activation of the GABAA receptor, a whispered incantation that conjured the somnambulant state, was a potent balm for the troubled mind. The inhibition of this receptor, a shadowy figure that stalked the dreams of the insomniac, brought forth a reduction in anxiety, a fleeting respite from the crushing weight of wakefulness.\n\nThe GABAB agonist, a chemical sorcery that wove its spell upon the mice, extended the duration of sleep, a fleeting respite from the desolate landscape of wakefulness. The implications of this study, a whispered promise of hope in the darkness, hinted at a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence in this receptor, a flaw in the fabric of existence, could unravel the very fabric of sleep, leaving the insomniac shrouded in an impenetrable veil of wakefulness.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study, a shadowy apparition that haunted the fringes of our understanding, suggested that the inherited phenotype of the GABAB receptor held sway over the insomniac's fate, a cruel mistress that governed the rhythms of existence. The disturbance of this receptor, a whispered secret in the dead of night, would unleash a maelstrom of consequences, a ravaging of the very fabric of life - the monotony of school, the drudgery of work, the suffocating tedium of daily existence.",
            "In the shadows of the mind, a silent affliction lurks, one that shrouds the clarity of sound in a veil of confusion. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, is a specter that haunts the realm of the brain, where the whispers of the world are lost in the din of disarray. It is a condition wherein the central nervous system, that most mysterious of territories, falters in its duty to unpack the tangled threads of sound, leaving the sufferer lost in a labyrinth of misheard meanings.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this affliction were first spoken in the hushed tones of the 1950s, when researchers began to probe the depths of auditory imperception. It was a nascent understanding, a glimmer of light in the darkness, that would eventually coalesce into the defined boundaries of CAPD. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari were among the first to chart the uncharted territories of this disorder, their maps guiding the way for those who would follow in their footsteps. The year 1961 saw the introduction of dichotic testing, a method that would become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of this most insidious of conditions.\n\nBut what are the telltale signs of this hidden foe? They are many, and varied, like the shifting sands of the desert. The sufferer may stumble in the darkness, unable to pinpoint the source of a sound; they may mistake the gentle breeze of a whispered secret for the crashing waves of a distant storm; they may falter in the face of conflicting rhythms, unable to discern the subtle nuances of tone and timbre. They may be unable to weave the threads of sound into a coherent tapestry, to synthesize the disparate elements into a meaningful whole. And they may be lost in the maze of sequence, unable to discern the order in which sounds present themselves.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a delicate dance, a patient hunt for signs of a disorder that is as elusive as a ghost. The audiologist, the SLP, the psychologist, and others must employ a variety of methods to unravel the tangled threads of the sufferer's perception. They must observe the subtlest of behaviors, the faintest of responses, and they must rely on the most advanced of technologies to uncover the hidden truths of the brain. The tests are many, and the tools are varied, but there is no one silver bullet, no single test that can pinpoint the source of this affliction with absolute certainty. And so the search continues, a relentless pursuit of understanding in the face of a disorder that is as enigmatic as the human mind itself.",
            "The playwright's pen dips into the darkness of deception, revealing the precarious balance between the self and the masks we wear. Twelfth Night poses a haunting question: in the depths of subterfuge, where do we find ourselves lost, and where do we find redemption? The heart's desire to protect itself from the cruel hands of fate often leads us down a path of disguise, where the lines between truth and lies are blurred. Yet, in this twilight world, one must confront the specter of isolation, the ghostly whispers of those we deceive, who may never forgive our transgressions.\n\nThe masquerade of gender, a fragile dance of identity, raises the stakes of deception. Viola's desperate gamble, a cry for survival in a foreign land, sets in motion a chain of events that will forever alter the course of her existence. She dons the guise of a man, a fragile armor that shields her from the predators that stalk the shadows. But in doing so, she sacrifices the solace of her own kind, the warmth of sisterly love and the gentle ministrations of women who could have been her allies. And so, she becomes a stranger in a strange land, a phantom among phantoms, her true self a distant memory, lost in the labyrinth of her own making.\n\nOlivia, a princess of elegance and refinement, becomes a willing pawn in Viola's game of deception. She is drawn to the mystery of Cesario, the boy who has captured her heart, but does she truly love the man, or the illusion of a man? The playwright's intentions are shrouded in ambiguity, leaving the audience to ponder the depths of Olivia's desires. Is she a victim of her own societal pressures, forced to conform to the expectations of those who would judge her? Or is she a willing participant in the charade, a master of the masquerade, who uses her wit and cunning to navigate the treacherous waters of love and desire?\n\nAs the play unfolds, the threads of deception become increasingly entangled, a tapestry of lies and half-truths that threaten to consume us all. In the end, it is not the preservation of relationships that matters, but the preservation of the self, a self that is ever-changing, ever-shifting, like the sands of the desert. And so, we are left to ponder the question: what lies at the heart of our own deceptions, and at the heart of our own desires?\n\nIn the silence of the night, we hear the whispers of Viola's confession: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) The words hang in the air like a challenge, a reminder that in the darkest depths of our own hearts, we too may be hiding, waiting for the moment to reveal our true selves, or to succumb to the shadows that haunt us.\n\nThe language of the text is heavy with the weight of ambiguity, leaving the reader to question the nature of deception and the masks we wear. And so, we are left to ponder the words of Olivia, a woman of mystery and intrigue: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) Is it a gesture of love, or a gesture of acceptance? Only the playwright knows, and the truth remains hidden, lost in the shadows of the human heart.",
            "The shadow of German colonial rule stretched across a continent, its darkness deepening with each passing year. The heavy hand of oppression, particularly in the annals of South West Africa, left an indelible mark, a genocide of unimaginable proportions perpetrated against the Ovaherero and Nama. And yet, this is but a faint glimpse into the labyrinthine complexities of a colonial empire that defied categorization. A hydra-like beast, its policies and governing styles as varied as the landscapes it claimed. The provision of education, too, was a patchwork of contrasts, a quilt stitched together from disparate threads.\n\nWhen the British inherited German East Africa in 1919, they found a population of Africans who had been schooled in the ways of literacy and knowledge. The German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were lauded by contemporaries, their praises echoing through the annals of history. Yet, in South West Africa, the situation was akin to a desolate wasteland. Unlike the verdant East Africa, where the government had taken an active role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa, the responsibility was left to the missionary societies, their meager support a testament to the colonial administration's apathy.\n\nThe government, however, did not neglect its own kind. In South West Africa, it invested heavily in the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and lavishing support upon the missionary institutions that served them. This dualistic approach would have far-reaching consequences, shaping the destiny of South West Africa long after the German rule had faded. While other colonies boasted of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa stood apart, its population largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The factors that contributed to this divergence were as complex as they were multifaceted, a tangled web of social, political, and economic forces that would be the focus of this inquiry.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is a vast and sprawling landscape, with works written in German dominating the early years of the colonial era. These early studies, penned in the early twentieth century, were primarily concerned with cataloging the features of the educational systems in the various colonies. Later, English-language works expanded the discourse, offering comparative studies and detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. Among these, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out, a seminal work that shed light on the factors that differentiated the two colonies. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a primary factor behind the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its temperate climate and arid expanses, presented a paradox. A land of contrasts, where the European population thrived, numbering nearly 15,000 by 1913, while the settler population in East Africa, the next largest, struggled to reach 5,336. This dichotomy would have far-reaching consequences, forming the backdrop against which the story of education in South West Africa would unfold.",
            "In the scorched expanse of a century, popular music has sprawled forth like a vast, twisted thicket, its branches tangled in an impenetrable thicket of genres. The taxonomy of this morass is a Sisyphean task, as most of the established genres – rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – have spawned a labyrinthine array of sub-genres, each one a labyrinthine offshoot of the last. And yet, it was in this maelstrom that heavy metal arose, a behemoth of sound that has come to embody the darker, more visceral aspects of the human experience.\n\nOver the past four decades, this sub-genre has evolved into a hydra-headed beast, its tendrils reaching out to ensnare a vast array of influences, from the primal howls of the devil's music to the ornate, baroque flourishes of the Romantic Era. And yet, at its core, metal remains a music of darkness, a sound that revels in the shadows, that conjures forth a world of midnight bleakness and desolation.\n\nIt is a music of excess, of overblown bombast and volume, of a primal, unbridled energy that threatens to consume all in its path. It is a music of the damned, of the forsaken, of those who dwell in the twilight realms of the human experience. And it is this very darkness that has drawn countless musicians to its fold, each one seeking to tap into the wellspring of sound that lies at metal's heart.\n\nThe earliest manifestations of this movement – the Beatles' 'Helter Skelter', the Rolling Stones' own 'Sympathy for the Devil' – were but tentative explorations of the darker side of the human experience. But it was the excesses of the 1970's, the psychedelic boom that swept across the land like a wildfire, that truly ignited the metal movement, imbuing it with a sense of reckless abandon and creative freedom. It was a music that reveled in the madness, that sought to push the boundaries of what was possible, to create a sound that was at once beautiful and brutal, sublime and profane.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves lost in this wilderness of sound, a labyrinthine maze of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, each one a reflection of the metal movement's boundless creativity, its refusal to be bound by the constraints of convention. It is a music that defies categorization, that resists summary, that simply is. And it is this very essence that has captured the hearts and minds of countless musicians, each one drawn to the siren song of metal, to its promise of darkness, of excess, of the unknown.",
            "In the twilight of a bygone era, a man's brush danced across canvas, birthing worlds of dreams and reveries that would soon beget a surrealist's fevered imaginings. Henri Rousseau, a painter of unassuming beginnings, wove his own tapestry of longing and aspiration, a testament to the burning desire that fuels the artist's soul. His magnum opus, The Dream, a painting born of 1910, stands as a chronicle of his inner turmoil, a struggle that would haunt him throughout his artistic existence: to submit to the conventions of the art world he so devoutly admired, or to chart his own unfettered course, a path that would lead him down a road of uncharted waters.\n\nTo grasp the essence of The Dream, one must first traverse the desolate landscape of Rousseau's life, a terrain marked by hardship and the unyielding pursuit of artistic expression. Born on a day like any other, May 21, 1844, in the forgotten village of Laval, northwest France, Henri Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer, a man who knew the value of a hard-earned coin. His early years were a blur of toil and labor, a gabelou's drudgery, a municipal toll collector's monotony. Yet, in the stillness of his heart, a flame of creativity flickered, a fire that would not be extinguished. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, a tragedy that would leave him bereft and broken, only intensified his longing for a new beginning, a chance to escape the suffocating shadows of his past. And so, in the midst of his grief, he turned to painting, a solace that would become his raison d'être.\n\nRousseau's quest for recognition, his yearning to be acknowledged by the art world he so revered, is a poignant testament to the human condition. A self-taught painter, a neophyte in the ways of art, he toiled in the shadows of his contemporaries, men like Matisse, who danced on the periphery of the avant-garde. Yet, it was Rousseau's very uniqueness that would become his undoing, a peculiarity that would set him apart from the art world he so desperately sought to join. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed in Modern French Painters, Rousseau's canvas was a reflection of his own contradictions, a synthesis of the conventional and the unconventional, a struggle to balance the need for acceptance with the desire for artistic freedom. And so, in The Dream, we find a painter's lament, a cri de coeur that echoes through the ages, a testament to the eternal conflict between the artist's heart and the world's expectations.",
            "In the depths of human understanding, a thread of connection weaves itself between the realms of ethics and aesthetics, binding truth and beauty in an unyielding knot. It is a notion that has long been posited by the weighty minds of thinkers past, a notion that holds fast in the oft-quoted words of John Keats: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" For in the uncharted territories of existence, we arrive at truths and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us not through the channels of education or experience, but through an untaught, primal sense that defies prescription.\n\nThe study of morality and beauty is a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task to grasp the ungraspable. We toil to explain, to describe, to dissect the essence of what is beautiful or moral, yet in the end, it is a description that falls short. A discourse on the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa may center on the minutiae of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, but these are but feeble attempts to grasp the elusive. For when asked about a beloved work of art or literature, a phrase oft precedes the more elaborate explanation: \"There's just something about it.\" And it is this \"something,\" this transcendent quality that cannot be captured, that is the very essence of both art and morality.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's words ring true: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" So too with ethics. The properties of a work of literature may be exhaustively described, but a transcendent quality remains, an unspoken truth that defies articulation. And it is this very property that binds ethics and aesthetics in an unbreakable link.\n\nWe experience both art and morality at a level that lies beyond the pale of reason, a noumenal realm that cannot be fully grasped. It is a connection that is uniquely strong in the realm of literature, where the moral quality is inescapable. As McKean so aptly puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" For in the words that we read, we find the values that shape our very existence. Living is a value-laden endeavor, and literature serves as a reflection of this fundamental truth.",
            "In the shadows of the Alps, where the mist-shrouded peaks plunge into the darkness, and on the unforgiving shores of the Baltic, the Germany of today stirs like a restless beast. A land of contrasts, where the medieval spires of München pierce the sky like skeletal fingers, and the Elbe River flows like a lifeblood through the ravaged heart of Dresden. It is a culture forged in the crucible of history, a patchwork of traditions stitched together from the disparate threads of a countless past. \n\nThe name \"Germania\" - a term shrouded in mystery - is a testament to the land's enigmatic origins. Some claim it owes its birth to the Tungrians, a benighted tribe that once roamed the banks of the Rhine. Others whisper that it was Julius Caesar who first penned the word \"Germanus\", a label he applied to the tribes he encountered beyond the Rhine, a people he deemed worthy of distinction from the Gauls he had subjugated. The Roman historian Tacitus, in his treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", wrote of a people untainted by intermarriage, a \"aboriginal\" stock that clung to their rugged terrain like a stubborn curse.\n\nThe land itself seemed inhospitable, a \"wild country\" where the skies raged with a ferocity that drove men to the edge of madness. Who, indeed, would trade the warmth of Asia or Africa for this unforgiving realm, where the winds howled like a chorus of the damned? And yet, the Germans persisted, their culture a litany of resilience in the face of an unyielding landscape. They forged their own path, trading their wares and their skills to the Romans, who saw fit to conquer their lands but not to stay. The Germanic tribes remained on the periphery, a thorn in the side of the Empire, a constant reminder that the forces of nature and the fury of the unknown would not be silenced.\n\nAs the centuries passed, the Germanic tribes began to assert their presence, their presence a testament to the indomitable will that coursed through their veins. They left their mark on the land, a testament to their unyielding spirit, a spirit that would one day shape the course of history in ways both grand and terrible.",
            "My gaze descended, a void in my mind where thought and comprehension converged, a blank slate upon which the world's image was inscribed.  It was a sight both mundane and wondrous, a bowl of fruit upon a table, its presence a testament to the banality of existence.  Yet, I felt no emotion, no spark of connection to this thing before me, only a detached, studied awareness that refused to yield to the ephemeral whispers of the mind.  My thoughts fluttered and died, like birds taking flight only to be snuffed out by the weight of the present moment.\n\nIn a distant past, a wise artist had counseled me to seek out a text, a guide to the mysteries of the creative process.  The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain was its name, and within its pages, I had discovered the secrets of perception, the hidden paths by which the brain unravels the tangled threads of reality.  Among its teachings was a technique, a simple yet profound exercise in discipline: to frame the subject, to reduce the chaos of the world to a manageable whole.  But on this day, as I stood before the bowl, I was unable to conjure this frame, to impose order upon the turmoil of my own mind.\n\nThe artists of old had known this struggle, had wrestled with the void and emerged with their visions.  Picasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of color – each had found their own path, their own voice.  And I, a humble aspirant, stood before the threshold of my own creation, Work in Brown.  My hand, a tool poised to bring forth beauty, shook with anticipation, the tension coiling within me like a spring.\n\nMy fingers brushed against the pencil, the muscles tensed and relaxed, as if awakening from a dream.  The water, a mirror's calm reflection, seemed to ripple and shudder, as if the very fabric of reality trembled at the prospect of creation.  And then, with a jolt, my hand struck the toilet handle, a mocking echo of the brushstrokes that might have brought forth a masterpiece.  The offending bundle, a brown, shapeless mass, refused to yield, stuck fast as a fly on a summer's day.\n\nThe mop, a makeshift staff, hung limply in my hand, as I stood before the unyielding mess, my green tie a garish wound around my throat.  The air was heavy with the stench of decay, a memento mori that mocked my aspirations.  The toilet, a portal to the abyss, seemed to gape at me, a void that swallowed all in its path.  My hand, a supplicant, rose to the sheet of toilet paper, wrapping itself in a futile attempt to grasp the ungraspable.  And then, with a slow, deliberate movement, I plunged my hand into the depths, a supplicant dipping into the unknown, a seeker of the holy grail of creation.",
            "In the desolate landscape of American roads, a specter haunts the streets, its presence as inescapable as the darkness of the night. Teenagers, with their lives as fragile as the morning dew, succumb to the cruel hand of fate, their bodies broken and still on the cold, hard asphalt. The National Institutes of Health whisper a terrible truth: the adolescent brain, still a malleable and impressionable thing, is woefully unprepared for the unforgiving hazards of driving. And so they falter, these young drivers, their inexperience a deadly weight that presses down upon them like a physical force, crushing them beneath its unyielding grip.\n\nTheir companions, too, contribute to the carnage, a motley crew of peers who ride shotgun, their presence a siren's call to recklessness. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center lays bare the correlation: the younger the passenger, the more traffic accidents that ensue. It is a cruel arithmetic, one that spells out the terrible truth in stark, unyielding terms.\n\nIn response, California and other states have resorted to provisional licenses, a palliative measure that only serves to stave off the inevitable. These temporary permits, designed to limit the hours of driving and exclude minors as passengers, are little more than a Band-Aid on a festering wound. The problem, as psychologist Marvin Zuckerman so astutely observes, lies deeper: the adolescent brain is hardwired to crave the thrill of the unknown, to court danger for the sheer exhilaration it brings. And so, we continue to issue driver's licenses to those too young to handle the risks, condemning them to a fate as predetermined as the rising sun.\n\nThe statistics scream out in horror, a chorus of death and destruction that threatens to crescendo into a maelstrom of carnage. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' progeny will flood the roads, a tidal wave of teen drivers poised to unleash a bloodbath of unprecedented proportions. The time for half-measures is over; the time for action is now.\n\nLegislation, though seemingly a simple matter, would in fact be a lifeline cast into the darkness, a beacon of hope in a sea of despair. Schools could continue to teach the basics of driving, but no one under the age of 18 should be permitted to wield the keys. A provisional permit could still be granted, but only after a rigorous course of study and a minimum number of supervised driving hours – the exact number, say, of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult, a standard already observed in many states.\n\nUniform, national legislation would be the only way to stem the tide of this national scourge, to protect the young from themselves and the unforgiving roads that await them. It is a measure that has been proposed before, but its urgency cannot be overstated. The lives of American teenagers hang in the balance, suspended like a pendulum between life and death. The clock ticks on, each passing moment a countdown to disaster. The time for action is now.",
            "I was drawn to the musty aisles of the Library of Congress's repository of Edison's early films, a collection that seemed to hold the whispers of a bygone era. My gaze settled on the trick films, fifteen in number, spanning from 1895 to 1901. These enigmatic works relied on the art of editing to conjure illusions that danced across the screen. As I delved into the poetics of these trick films, I found myself tracing the evolutionary threads that connected them, separating the outliers from the pack.\n\nIn those early days of cinema, the trick film was a creature bound to the stage, confined within a frontal proscenium, its movements restricted by the strictures of a single, static shot. The camera stood still, a sentinel, as the world unfolded before it. Long shots and medium shots were the norm, with close-ups a rarity, a luxury the camera could not afford. This was a cinema born of the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience was privy to the entire performance, a panorama framed by the borders of the stage.\n\nBut there were those who dared to challenge the conventions, to break free from the shackles of the one-shot, one-film methodology. In the early years of the twentieth century, a few films began to push the boundaries, incorporating multiple shots, fragmenting the narrative, and shattering the illusion. The trick films, however, remained steadfast in their adherence to the stage, their figures moving in a stilted, two-dimensional world, unable to break free from the confines of the frame.\n\nTake, for example, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors entered from the right, their movements restricted to a horizontal axis, never venturing forth or back, as if held captive by the very fabric of the screen. And even as they vanished from view, the camera stood firm, unmoving, a witness to the illusion.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also imposed its will on the length of the shots, favoring long, sweeping vistas, and the occasional medium shot. Close-ups were anathema, a rarity that seemed to defy the very essence of the medium. This was a cinema that drew from the wellspring of the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience beheld the entirety of the performance, unencumbered by the intimacy of the close-up.\n\nMost trick films conformed to the pattern of one conceptual shot, one film, a limitation that shackled the narrative to the brief, the ephemeral. Their stories, like the tricks themselves, were short, fleeting, and inconsequential, mere diversions from the mundane. But, as I discovered, the line between the physical and the conceptual was blurred, a single \"shot\" often comprising multiple, joined frames, a magician's sleight of hand that conjured the illusion of apparition or disappearance. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), I found myself peering behind the veil, tracing the moment where the physical shot gave way to the illusion, a single, seamless gesture that left the viewer gasping in wonder.",
            "In the somber vista of American politics, a singular figure emerged, one whose unwavering dedication to the creed of Republicanism would leave an indelible mark on the nascent nation. John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the land, with calloused hands and a steadfast resolve, coupled his agrarian pursuits with a brief foray into the realm of politics, forging a reputation as a champion of unyielding conviction and unrelenting passion for the unfettered exercise of personal freedom and government restraint. The bedrock of his convictions, the agrarian system, served as the lodestar guiding his opinions on the very fabric of governance, sovereignty, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor's vision for the United States was one of an ideal system, unencumbered by the weight of native tradition, allowing for the unfettered creation of a self-governing entity. He ardently believed in the inherent rights of man, inalienable and intertwined, such that the denial of one would precipitate the downfall of all, rendering the remaining void of value. These rights, he posited, must remain beyond the reach of government's grasping hand. In the state of nature, it was the strong and the cunning who reaped the benefits, but in a civilization, such a reality must be rebuked.\n\nTo craft this ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that accounted for the dual nature of humanity: the inherent good and evil that resided within. His rigid adherence to a dualistic morality led him to proclaim that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" The distinction, he believed, lay in the principles that governed: those that safeguarded private property, nourished agriculture, and checked the excesses of capitalism. A government founded on such principles would function in equilibrium, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be guided by the twin scourges of avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he noted, was the driving force behind human endeavor, but it was only when it led to the subjugation of one by another that it became an evil to be reckoned with. A good government, he argued, was necessary to contain this latent evil, and to ensure it did not give rise to new, malignant principles.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, championed a strict construction of the Constitution, seeking a federal government of limited scope, with powers proscribed by the explicit language of the document. The dangers of an overreaching federal authority, he believed, lay in its profligacy and the specter of despotism that accompanied it. Yet, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation, which, devoid of context, could easily become pernicious. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, served as the true charter of the United States, its words more eloquently articulating the country as a confederation of sovereign states, rather than a unified nation.",
            "In the third month of our endeavor, a precipitous decline in commuter log submissions presented itself, a disheartening turn of events that defied easy explanation. The winter's chill had begun to set in, casting a pall over the campus, and it was likely that the fewer numbers of cyclists and pedestrians that traversed the frozen landscape contributed to the downturn. The end of the fall semester brought with it a season of feverish activity, as students scrambled to complete their coursework and instructors rushed to grade their papers, their minds preoccupied with the coming winter's darkness. The log, once a steadfast companion to their daily routines, now slipped from their minds like a forgotten thing. And then, of course, there was the holiday season, a time of revelry and distraction that drove many to abandon the campus altogether, their log submissions falling by the wayside.\n\nBut even after the semester's resumption in late January, when the campus stirred once more, the numbers remained low, a mystery that refused to yield its secrets. Some might say that projects of this sort are wont to follow a natural arc, a burst of energy at their inception followed by a gradual decline. We might have been doomed to follow this trajectory, our efforts to buck the trend ultimately in vain. Yet we sought to counter this trend, to rekindle the flame of enthusiasm that had once burned so brightly. And so we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a campaign of sorts to revive the project's flagging fortunes. And to our surprise, it worked, the numbers swelling in March as the challenge took hold.\n\nBut the challenges we faced ran deeper than mere seasonal fluctuations or the natural ebb and flow of a project's popularity. At its core, the project was hampered by the entrenched habits of a people, their love of independence and the freedom that came with driving their own vehicles. It was a deeply ingrained habit, one that our efforts to supplant with alternative modes of transportation were likely to struggle against. And so we resorted to offering incentives, prizes of a sort to tempt them from their cars and onto the buses and trains. We gave out gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, hoping to entice them with the promise of a free meal or a warm cup of coffee. But one cannot help but wonder what might have been achieved had we offered something more substantial, something that spoke to the very heart of our car-addled culture: a bicycle, a hybrid car, or perhaps an electric vehicle, its sleek lines and whirring motor a beacon to those who sought a different way.\n\nIf only we had known what the outcome would be, we might have offered such prizes in the depths of winter, when the project's fortunes seemed at their lowest ebb. Perhaps, then, the numbers would have swelled, and our project would have gained the momentum it so sorely needed. But as it was, we were left to ponder what might have been, our efforts to rekindle the project's flame reduced to naught but a faint glow in the darkness.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of the financial markets, a peculiar creature roams, known as the Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF.  A security both akin to an index fund and a stock, but with the flexibility to adapt and change as the wind whispers through the trees.  It offers the diversification of a broad index, the benefits of single stock ownership, and the freedom to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase a single share in the blink of an eye.  The allure of such a creature is undeniable, yet it is a siren's call that beckons with a price.  For in the depths of the ETF's promise lies a cost, a commission that must be paid with each transaction, a toll exacted by the market's unforgiving hand.\n\nAnd yet, the ETF's benefits are legion, a veritable cornucopia of advantages that beckon the savvy investor to partake.  The variety of funds available is staggering, a tapestry woven from countless threads, each one a distinct pattern of investment.  But, as the wise investor knows, benefits must be weighed against costs, and the value of diversification, like a mirage on a desert highway, must be carefully evaluated.  For the purposes of this exercise, we shall examine the ETF IHF, a creature of the market, and compare it to the top 10 holdings that comprise its very being.  We shall seek to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks that comprise it, and whether there are other configurations of these same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\nTo gain a glimpse into the ETF's inner workings, we shall focus on the top 10 holdings, those that account for 63.58% of its total assets.  These are the titans that shape the ETF's character, its very essence.  Below, we shall present the top 10 holdings, their percentage of total assets, a stark reminder of their influence.\n\nTo assess the validity of our findings, we shall use a statistical tool, a means of estimation that seeks to quantify the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return.  The calculations shall be presented in a chart, a visual representation of the data, a map of the ETF's terrain.  From this chart, it is evident that a portfolio composed of the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF as a whole, a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF, a testament to its reduced volatility.\n\nBut, like the desert wind, our findings may be nothing more than a mirage.  To determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, a measure of their volatility.  We shall normalize these values to 100%, a means of comparison, a yardstick to measure the accumulated risk of each portfolio.  The results of this exercise shall reveal whether the portfolios are, in truth, distinct, or merely a product of chance, a fleeting illusion in the vast expanse of the market.",
            "The melancholy shores of Dream-Land, a poem born of Edgar Allan Poe's troubled soul, stands as a testament to his affinity for the dark recesses of the human experience. In his lamentable verse, the name \"Thulé\" echoes through the lines like a mournful sigh, a whispered reminder of a world beyond the reaches of mortal comprehension. The erudite Mabbott notes the origin of this term in the venerable Virgil, whose words spoke of an island shrouded in mystery, a place where the Greeks believed the known world gave way to an abyss of unknown terrors. Yet, it is in the realm of German literature that we find the true source of Poe's fascination with Thulé.\n\nA shadowy figure looms in the background, a giant of letters whose influence cast a long and sinister shadow over the literary landscape of the 19th century: Goethe. Poe's esteem for the German master is palpable, a respect that borders on reverence. Karl J. Arndt's piercing insight into the parallels between Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon reveals a poet consumed by the echoes of his predecessor's work, a haunted echo that refuses to be silenced.\n\nIn Goethe's Faust, a masterpiece of poetic drama, we find a telltale sign of the Thulé's presence. The second part of this sprawling epic, penned in the final year of Goethe's life, holds a small but significant gem: \"The King of Thulé\", a haunting tale of a monarch undone by the loss of his beloved wife. His grief is a consuming force, a maelstrom that threatens to engulf him whole, driving him to the brink of madness and despair. His descent into the abyss is a cautionary tale of the destructive power of love and loss.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are too striking to be mere coincidence. Both works speak to the same dark and forsaken landscape, a world where the colors have been drained from the palette of existence, leaving only shades of grey and the haunting specter of mortality. Poe's use of the term \"ultma Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, a phrase that echoes the King's lament in Goethe's poem, serves as a reminder that the boundaries between reality and nightmare are perilously thin.\n\nIn the shadowy realm of Dream-Land, the speaker wanders, lost and forlorn, haunted by the ghosts of dead friends and the desolate landscape of a world without color or hope. It is a world that speaks to the very heart of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\", a world where the lines between reality and madness are blurred, and the only solace is the cold comfort of death.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is a matter of record, a fact confirmed by the poet's own words, spoken with reverence and awe. His admiration for Tennyson, a poet who owed a debt to Goethe's own mastery, served as a bridge between the two literary worlds, a testament to the far-reaching influence of the German master. And so, we find ourselves drawn into the dark and foreboding world of Dream-Land, a world that echoes the haunted landscapes of Goethe's imagination, a world where the shadows loom large, and the light of hope is but a distant memory.",
            "The sun beat down upon the asphalt expanse of the parking lot as Jennifer Palmer made her way into the sterile confines of D&D Markets, her footsteps echoing off the fluorescent lights that cast an unforgiving glare upon the aisles. It was a moment of carelessness that would change her life forever, a moment that would leave her writhing in agony, her back shattered by the cruel hand of fate. A spill, a seemingly insignificant splatter of applesauce upon the floor, lay in wait, a trap set by the very people who were supposed to protect her.\n\nThe store manager, Paul Martin, had been warned twice of the danger, twice informed of the spill's presence, and yet he chose to ignore it, to turn a blind eye to the probable harm that would befall those who walked upon that floor. His excuse, a paltry one, a feeble attempt to shift the blame: he was eating dinner, and thus could not be bothered to attend to the matter at hand. The minutes ticked by, a half-hour of inaction, a half-hour of willful disregard for the safety of those who entered his store.\n\nSix slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the months prior to Palmer's accident, a litany of warnings that went unheeded, a testament to the store's cavalier attitude towards the well-being of its customers. And yet, Martin continued to fail to act, to show a callous disregard for the rights and safety of those who walked through his doors. His actions, those of a man who had abandoned all sense of responsibility, all sense of duty.\n\nThe question before us is this: can a customer who has been so callously disregarded, so callously injured, be awarded punitive damages? Can the court justify such a punishment, one that seeks to right the wrongs of the past, to hold accountable those who have acted with such malice? The answer, we are told, lies in the law, in the statutes that govern such cases. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract, if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" And what is malice, you ask? Is it not the conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, a willful and deliberate failure to act when the consequences of inaction are clear? The courts have spoken on this matter, and their words are clear: conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, when the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions, and yet willfully and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.\n\nThe facts of this case are stark, a tale of negligence and malice, of a store that has shown a callous disregard for the safety of its customers. The question now is, what will be the consequence of such actions? Will the courts see fit to award punitive damages, to punish those who have acted with such malice? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the people of this state demand justice, and it is the duty of the courts to see that it is served.",
            "Four winters ago, I wandered into a class on the tenets of Islam at the CBC, and it was there that the seeds of discord were sown.  A question hung heavy in the air, one that still festers to this day: is Islam a creed of hostility?  I had thought it a query of little consequence, but the more I delved into the subject, the more I came to realize its relevance.  The passage of time, marked by the smoldering embers of 9/11, has seen a transformation in the gaze of the media.  What was once a hostile scrutiny has given way to an almost reverent tolerance, an unyielding acceptance that borders on complicity.  And so, in this altered landscape, a man with a name that echoes the distant shores of the Old World can rise to the highest office in the land, a man whose familial ties to Islam are as plain as the nose on his face.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad holds a peculiar fascination for me, a paradoxical tome that defies the expectations I had formed of its subject.  According to the chronicle, Muhammad was a man of humility, a martyr misunderstood by his contemporaries, who humbled himself before them, and yet, it was this very humility that drew people to him, one by one, like moths to a flame.  This portrayal stands in stark contrast to the image I had conjured of a man who would not hesitate to wield power, who would conquer and subjugate, forcing his will upon the tribes he vanquished, compelling them to submit to his creed.\n\nAnd then, there are the echoes of a familiar narrative, a tale of miracles and wondrous deeds that recall the Gospels.  The story of the multiplication of bread and cheese, a feat that would have fed forty men, is a case in point.  This kind of writing, I suspect, is a deliberate attempt to cast Muhammad in a certain light, to portray him as a prophet who did not need to prove himself, but rather lived in a state of effortless truth and miracle.  This, to my mind, is a pitfall, a fallacy that diminishes the very real and profound life of Jesus Christ, who was not a figure to be emulated or co-opted, but revered in his own right.\n\nThe biography is replete with accounts of conversions, of people coming to Muhammad on their own, uncoerced and unforced.  But these stories, I found, are often third-hand, filtered through the lens of intermediaries, their veracity tenuous at best.  This, to me, only serves to sully the narrative, to render it suspect and open to interpretation.\n\nWhat troubles me most, however, is the way the biography seeks to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal, to portray him as a paragon of virtue, a godly man of humility and wisdom.  But history, that great leveler, tells a different tale, one of a man who rose to power through a complex web of alliances and conquests.  And I am left to wonder, do the adherents of Islam today know the true story of their Prophet's ascension to greatness?",
            "In the sullen aftermath of Christ's departure, the tenets of his teachings were left to wither like autumn leaves, cast aside by the relentless tide of Christian thought that surged forward, heedless of its source.  The passage of time revealed a trajectory of aberration, a meandering path that led further and further from the original intent.  Yet, in the gathering twilight of the world, a growing awareness stirs, a yearning to unshackle the faith from the accumulated weight of doctrine, to strip away the accretions that had been layered upon its core.  It may be a slow and arduous process, one that will take generations, perhaps centuries, to unfold.  But the end will be inescapable: a great reversal, a return to the primordial form, a stripping away of the extraneous, until naught remains but the essence of Christ's message, unadulterated and unencumbered by the claims of later interpreters.\n\nThe clock, it seems, will be turned backward, its hands unwinding as the church, that bastion of tradition, leads the faithful on a journey of rediscovery.  The diverse and disparate branches of Christendom, once a tapestry woven from the threads of countless interpretations, will begin to reveal their shared tapestry, a rich and vibrant fabric of unity.  It is a process that has played out before, in the grand tapestry of human history.  We see it in the rise of Christianity from the ashes of Roman oppression, in the transformation of a nation founded on the shackles of slavery to one that proudly proclaims the leadership of its African-American sons and daughters.\n\nAnd yet, it is a path fraught with peril, for it demands a willingness to read the words of Christ not as literal truths, but as metaphors that speak to the human condition.  It is a reading that requires a certain kind of courage, a willingness to strip away the veil of dogma and confront the raw power of the human experience.  For in the end, it is not the specifics of doctrine that matter, but the essence of the message itself, that great and abiding truth that has been at the heart of faith since the dawn of time.\n\nLooking back, we find the beginnings of this great narrative in the ancient soil of Judaism, that rich and fertile ground from which Christianity sprouted.  There, in the crucible of monotheism, the Hebrew scriptures, and the authority of the divine, we find the seeds of a faith that would one day spread far and wide.  But even in those early days, the Jewish people were not a monolithic entity, rather a tapestry of disparate threads, each with its own unique voice and perspective: the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the countless others who made up the body of the faith.  It is a testament to the enduring power of human spirit, a spirit that would one day give rise to a faith that would change the course of history.  And it is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of transformation, always the chance for a new dawn to break, and for the human heart to be renewed.",
            "In the darkest recesses of the human heart, a malignancy festers. A cancer of self-interest that gnaws at the very marrow of our existence. The Jungle lays bare this depravity, a stark and unflinching expose of a people consumed by their own avarice. They toil, these men and women, driven by a singular desire to eke out a meager existence, to scrape together a existence of fleeting comfort and security. And yet, in their fervor, they trample all that lies in their path, heedless of the ruin they leave in their wake.\n\nThe titans of industry, those grasping masters of the great factories, are the embodiment of this rapacious hunger. Theirs is an insatiable drive for power and wealth, a lust that knows no bounds. They care not a whit for the lives they crush beneath their heel, nor the earth they sully with their pollution. As Sinclair's words evoke the image of the factories, a bleak and foreboding silhouette against the sky, the very air thick with the noxious fumes of their machinations. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A dire litany of neglect and abandon, a testament to the desolate toll of their progress.\n\nTheir concern for their employees is but a distant abstraction, a hollow sham. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They wield their power with an iron fist, crushing all who dare oppose them. The workingmen toil in a living hell of long hours and squalid conditions, their sweat and blood the lifeblood of the factories. And when they falter, when their bodies break beneath the weight of their labor, they are cast aside like so much trash, discarded without a second thought.\n\nIn that era, a time of unbridled greed and unchecked power, the workers were but pawns in a game they did not understand. No shield of law protected them from the whims of their masters, no safety net to catch their fall. The unions, formed in a desperate bid for solidarity, often proved a mirage, a cruel mockery of the workers' hopes. And so they toiled, these wretched souls, their lives a struggle to survive in a world that seemed determined to crush them. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" A bleak and unvarnished truth, a testament to the darkness that lies at the heart of human nature.",
            "The canvas of meaning is painted with the strokes of words, a tapestry woven from the threads of association and suggestion. F. Scott Fitzgerald, a master of this craft, employs a multitude of techniques to conjure the essence of his subjects. His novel, The Great Gatsby, is a testament to his skill, as he coaxes the reader into a world of subtle nuance and rich connotation.\n\nFitzgerald's palette is vast, yet he chooses to drench his narrative in the hues of gold, green, white, and gray. These colors, initially blank canvases, are imbued with meaning, only to be summoned later to reinforce the significance of crucial objects. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald invests the dichotomy of white and gray with particular import, whispering to the reader the secrets of class and age.\n\nIn the opening pages, the reader is presented with a tableau of whiteness, a sea of purity and refinement. Daisy and Jordan, titans of elegance, move through the narrative swathed in white, their very being an affirmation of the color's association with aristocracy. Even the narrator, Nick Carraway, is not immune to the allure of white, donning \"white flannels\" to attend Gatsby's grand fete. Conversely, Tom, the symbol of solidity and tradition, sports a \"white shirt\" at his encounter with Myrtle, underscoring the color's connection to class and status.\n\nHowever, it is not merely the presence of white that defines its significance. Fitzgerald also employs its absence to create a sense of contrast. As Nick navigates the city, he traverses \"white chasms\" of lower New York, the city's underbelly laid bare. The names of the guests at Gatsby's parties are relegated to a \"gray list,\" their importance diminished by the passage of time. Even the landscape itself is drained of vibrancy, reduced to a \"gray land\" of ashes.\n\nIt is in these moments of subtlety that Fitzgerald's mastery of suggestion is revealed. He coaxes the reader into a world of inference, where meaning is drawn from the shadows. And it is this very subtlety that allows him to strip away the facade of Daisy, reducing her to a mere \"white\" object of desire, a mere addition to Gatsby's ever-growing collection of possessions. The \"gray haze\" of her fur collar, the \"white\" dress she wears before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby – each is a deliberate choice, a thread in the tapestry of meaning that Fitzgerald has so skillfully woven.\n\nIn the end, it is not the explicit statement that reveals the depth of Fitzgerald's craft, but the whispered suggestion, the hint of meaning that lingers in the shadows, waiting to be uncovered by the attentive reader.",
            "The land, a patchwork quilt of chaparral, non-native grasses, and oak woodland, sprawls across the arid expanse like a worn and weathered skin. San Diego County's temperate climate, a gentle benediction of sunshine and moderate rainfall, has rendered this tract a verdant oasis, a fertile cradle for the earthy fruits of labor. Tomatoes, citrus, and leafy greens burst forth from the earth, their verdant shoots a testament to the land's unfettered potential. Peaches and lemons, tree fruits that cling to the branch like the last wisps of dawn's mist, hang heavy with promise. Berries, a tangled skein of sweetness, and peppers, their fiery essence a spark of life, complete the tapestry of this agricultural tapestry. The locals, a throng of devotees to the organic cause, clamor for the taste of this land's bounty, their demand a siren's call that echoes through the hills.\n\nA niche market, a hidden cleft in the market's jagged edge, beckons to the enterprising farmer. The calls for organic, community-supported agriculture resound through the land, a rallying cry that summons the brave and the devoted. Eggs and milk, the pure and unadulterated products of this earth, fetch a premium price, their value a testament to the riches that lie within. And yet, the farmer must navigate the treacherous shoals of cost and profit, a delicate balance that shifts like the sands in an hourglass. The land, a canvas of untold potential, demands a stewardship that is both fierce and gentle, a dance between the competing demands of profit and preservation.\n\nThe land itself, a storied and ancient presence, whispers secrets to those who would listen. For centuries, it has borne witness to the ebb and flow of human endeavor, a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before. Native Americans, their footprints erased by time, left their mark upon this land, a legacy of tradition and lore. Cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers, their names etched upon the pages of history, followed in their footsteps, their presence a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of time.\n\nThis, then, is the land, a canvas of untold potential, a site of ancient power and modern struggle. A farmer, a steward of this earth, must navigate the shifting sands of cost and profit, ever mindful of the delicate balance between the demands of the land and the needs of the market. The government programs, a patchwork of aid and support, beckon to the farmer, a lifeline in the turbulent sea of uncertainty. And yet, the land remains, a constant presence, a reminder of the enduring power of the natural world.\n\nI chose this land, a parcel of 160 acres, situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, a complex web of species and habitat, considers over a hundred species, many of which are endangered or declining. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, their names etched upon the pages of extinction, hang in the balance, their fate a testament to the fragility of life.\n\nThis land, a piece of the original homestead patent, has borne witness to the ebb and flow of human endeavor, its history a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before. The Native Americans, their footprints erased by time, left their mark upon this land, a legacy of tradition and lore. And now, I, a seeker of knowledge, have come to this place, a site of ancient power and modern struggle, to learn from its secrets and to understand the delicate balance between the demands of the land and the needs of the market.",
            "Culture hangs in the balance like an unspoken weight, its presence as palpable as the silence between two men on a dusty road. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what it is not, as much as what it is. A culture is not a singular thing, nor a fixed entity, but a fluid, ever-shifting entity that defies easy categorization. To say that all Russians are stubborn or that all Japanese are accommodating is to oversimplify the labyrinthine complexities of the human experience. The notion that a culture can be reduced to a few fleeting generalities is a folly, a seductive lie that tempts the unwary into the quicksand of misperception.\n\nTo truly grasp the essence of a culture, one must dig deeper, into the rich soil of its history, its prejudices, its very marrow. It is not a matter of judging or seeking to change, but of accepting it for what it is, a force that shapes and is shaped by the negotiations that unfold before us. When we approach a foreign culture, we bring with us the biases of our own, the specter of our own experiences, and the comparisons that inevitably arise are a pale reflection of the reality that lies before us.\n\nTo navigate this treacherous terrain, a negotiator must be willing to listen, to observe, and to learn. He must be attuned to the subtle nuances of body language, the cadence of language, the rhythms of communication that speak to the heart of a culture. For it is not the surface-level trappings of culture that matter, but the deeper currents that shape its very fabric. The traditions, the customs, the values that underpin a culture are the keys to unlocking its essence, and it is these that a negotiator must seek to understand.\n\nAnd yet, culture is not a monolith, a singular entity that can be reduced to a few neat categories. It is a multifaceted gem, cut in a thousand different ways, reflecting the diversity of thought and experience that lies within. A company's culture, for example, may be as varied as the individuals who comprise it, reflecting the values, the attitudes, and the traditions that shape its very being. The dress code, the communication style, the hiring practices – all these and more speak to the culture that resides within, a culture that is as unique as the individuals who inhabit it.\n\nBut values, those bedrock principles that underpin a culture, are the key to unlocking its essence. They speak to the very heart of what drives a culture, the motivations that shape its actions, and the attitudes that inform its decisions. A culture that values saving face, communal harmony, or the pursuit of a hard-driven bargain will act accordingly, and it is the negotiator who understands these values, who can read the signs, who can navigate the complex web of relationships that underpin a culture, who will emerge triumphant.\n\nTo truly succeed in the art of negotiation, one must be willing to strip away the façade, to peer into the depths of a culture, and to emerge with a deeper understanding of its essence. It is a journey that requires patience, empathy, and a willingness to learn, for it is in the unknown, in the uncharted territories of the human experience, that the greatest rewards lie in wait.",
            "In the wilderness of the human heart, a desolate cry echoes forth: \"There is no God.\"  It is a refrain first inscribed in the dusty pages of Psalm 14, a testament to the unyielding skepticism that has long stalked the paths of men.  And so it is, too, with Thomas Aquinas, a voice crying out in the darkness, seeking to illuminate the shadows with the faint glow of reason.  St. Anselm, a precursor to this quest, stood before him, a beacon of faith that cast a different light upon the same desolate landscape.\n\nTo compare the arguments of these two men, we must first accept that they speak of the same God, the God of the Bible, a deity born of blood and fire, of sacrifice and redemption.  To conjure a false idol, a God of our own making, would be to betray the very purpose of their discourse.  And so, we must proceed with the understanding that their words are a testament to their shared conviction, a conviction that we shall dissect with the precision of a surgeon.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument is a labyrinth of introspection, a journey into the very depths of the human soul.  He posits that the existence of God is a truth that can be unearthed within the recesses of our own minds, a truth that cannot be diminished by the weight of empirical evidence.  It is a truth that arises from the dust of our own understanding, a spark that ignites within the darkness.  And so, he writes, we need not look beyond the boundaries of our own consciousness to find the proof of God, for it lies within the very fabric of our being.\n\nBut Thomas Aquinas has a different path to tread.  He is a man of reason, a seeker of logic and evidence.  He believes that the existence of God can be proved, not through the whispers of faith, but through the cold, unforgiving light of reason.  He marshals five arguments, a phalanx of logic that seeks to vanquish the shadows of doubt.  He speaks of change, of causation, of contingency, of degrees of excellence, and of harmony, each a stone in the edifice of his proof.  And in each, he demonstrates the inexorable logic of God's existence, a truth that cannot be denied, a truth that rises from the ashes of human understanding.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of time, a prince emerged, his name lost to the annals of history, yet destined to bear the moniker Buddha, the Awakened One. The weight of his existence bore down upon him like a stone, a burden he would eventually cast aside, like a worn cloak. His footsteps led him down a path of renunciation, into the depths of the self, where the shadows danced with the whispers of impermanence. And there, in the stillness, he found the light, a radiance that illuminated the darkness, and his teachings gave rise to a faith that would spread like a slow-moving tide.\n\nBuddhism, a creed born of his wisdom, now stretches across the expanse of centuries, its contours worn by the touch of time. In the distant land of Sri Lanka, where the Theravada nation holds sway, the ancient rituals persist, a testament to the indomitable will of the faithful. The water-cutting ceremony, a spectacle both mystifying and beautiful, draws participants from all walks of life, a ceremony born not from the words of the Buddha, but from the fertile soil of tradition. It is a reminder that the teachings of the past, like autumn leaves, wither and fade, leaving behind the seeds of a new harvest.\n\nIn this vast and shifting landscape, where the contours of doctrine blur and shift, it is essential to grasp the fundamental principles that underpin the Theravada faith. The triple gem, a trio of sacred pillars, stands steadfast against the tempests of time: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and labyrinthine tapestry, weaves together the threads of the Tripitaka, three baskets of scripture that hold the secrets of the cosmos. The Sutta Pitaka, a repository of the Buddha's words, contains the Suttas, vessels of wisdom; the Vinaya Pitaka, a code of conduct, outlines the rules that govern the lives of the faithful; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a realm of metaphysical mysteries, whispers secrets of the universe, of the fleeting nature of existence, and the illusion of the self.\n\nIn this realm of shadows and light, the concepts of Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca hold sway, their presence a reminder of the impermanence that shapes all things. It is only by recognizing these truths that one may escape the cycle of Sansara, the Samsaric wheel, where desire, hatred, and delusion bind us, like chains to a forgotten past. The Vinaya Pitaka, a code of conduct, outlines the rules that govern the lives of the faithful, a path of moderation and restraint, a balance between the extremes of indulgence and asceticism. For the layman, five precepts serve as a beacon, guiding him along the path of righteousness: to refrain from taking life, from falsehood, from thievery, from licentiousness, and from intoxication. For the monk, a more stringent code, a set of disciplines, serves as a reminder of the gravity of his commitment.\n\nAnd at the very heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths, a quartet of declarations that illuminate the human condition: that life is suffering, that attachment is the source of suffering, that suffering can be overcome, and that the path to liberation lies in the recognition of these truths.",
            "The ravages of time have witnessed a protracted and unyielding enmity between the United States and Mexico, a conflict that scorched the landscape for a span of 57 years, from the ravaged year of 1836 to the dying embers of 1893. The tempests of war, most notably the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, had left an indelible mark upon the soil, as the victor claimed dominion over the newly acquired territories of Texas and the American Southwest. The tumultuous relations between the two nations had been forged in the crucible of conflicting interests, a maelstrom of clashing values and traditions that would not abate until the First World War brought a measure of respite.\n\nThis was no isolated phenomenon, for border nations oft find themselves beset by the same trials, their interests and values pulling them apart like a tectonic fault line. The United States and Mexico, like a pair of weathered adversaries, had been locked in a perpetual struggle, their differences in creed and culture a chasm that seemed insurmountable. As David M. Pletcher observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, intractable American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41), a testament to the enduring nature of their animosity.\n\nThe discord between the two nations was not solely the result of ideological differences, but rather the weight of their colonial past, a legacy of distrust and animosity bequeathed by the English and Spanish. The United States, with its Protestant heritage, had long been wary of the Catholicism that dominated the Mexican heartland, a divide that would prove as insurmountable as the Rio Grande. As Sally Frahm noted, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86), a litany of grievances that would fuel the fires of their animosity.\n\nThe long and winding road to reconciliation was fraught with peril, as the two nations clashed over territorial disputes, border raids, and the lawless expanse of the frontier. Diehl and Goerts (2000) chronicled 17 such disputes, a litany of conflicts that would have been insurmountable were it not for the shifting tides of power and the changing ambitions of the United States. As Schmitt (1974) astutely observed, it was only when Mexico became \"clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" that the rivalry began to abate, its final embers extinguished as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the latter half of the 19th century.",
            "It has been fifteen years since the darkness crept in, a stealthy thief that stole my vitality and left me a shadow of my former self. I was a nurse, a profession born of necessity, a desperate bid to escape the poverty and uncertainty that had long defined my existence. The mantra that echoed through my adolescence, a cold comfort, had been: \"You'll always find work; people will always fall ill.\" And so I chose the path of service, a compromise that would allow me to eke out a living, to scrape by in a world that seemed determined to crush me.\n\nNow, at 46, I am a relic, a spent thing, my bank accounts depleted, my future as uncertain as the wind. Fifteen years of living on the charity of the state have stripped me bare, leaving me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a relentless assault on my very being, a reminder that security, safety, and self-respect are fleeting illusions. And yet, in this desolate landscape, one truth remains: it was the kindness of strangers, the love of family and friends, that sustained me, that allowed me to cling to life.\n\nFor in the face of disaster, be it great or small, we are not strong enough to stand alone. We are fragile, vulnerable, and broken. And so, in this cold, unforgiving world, I implore you: do not place your faith in the empty promises of those who would have you believe that you are sufficient, that you are self-sufficient. Learn to trust in the goodness of others, to ask for help, to offer help. For it was not rugged individualism that carried our forebears across the wilderness, but compassion, respect, and a willingness to share what little they had.\n\nThe Conservatives would have us believe that it was the rugged individualist who built this nation, who carved out a home in the unforgiving vastness. But I know better. I know that it was the shared burdens, the collective struggles, the kindness of strangers that saw us through the darkest of times.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. Store your food and water, stockpile your supplies, and board up your windows. But do not forget the most essential tool of all: the willingness to ask for help, to offer help, to be a neighbor to those around you. For in the end, it is not the preparedness that will see us through, but the human connections that bind us together.",
            "[The darkness that shrouds the labyrinthine paths of evolution.  We seek to unravel the mysteries that govern the trajectory of life, to discern the guiding principles that dictate the course of change.  For even the most skilled of zoologists, the task of defining the organic forms that inhabit our world remains a Sisyphean endeavor, a quest that has been undertaken by few and accomplished by none.  The words of D'Arcy Thompson, spoken in 1917, still echo through the chambers of time: \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\"  And yet, we press on, driven by the faint glimmer of understanding that may be gleaned from the austere beauty of mathematical models.\n\nIn our study, we have set our sights on the humble mollusk, Prunum, and sought to apply the cold, unforgiving logic of mathematical modeling to the study of its skeletogenesis.  Through the application of X-radiographic images and the aid of the software program CerioShell, we have endeavored to quantify the parameters that govern the development of this creature's shell.  Like a topographer charting the unmapped terrain of a foreign land, we have sought to delineate the contours of possible morphological change, to chart the course of evolution through the dark and unforgiving expanse of time.\n\nThe shell, that most wondrous of structures, can be seen as a tube that travels through the 360 degrees of space, a spiral that unwinds through the ages.  The whorls, those successive coils that comprise the shell, are but a testament to the ceaseless drive of the mollusk's growth, a spiral that spirals outward from the central axis, the columella.  And the sutures, those thin lines that separate each whorl, they mark the passage of time, the slow and incremental accumulation of growth.\n\nBut what of the shell's geometry, that most abstract of concepts?  Can we quantify the shape, the form, the very essence of this most wondrous of structures?  Can we chart the trajectory of the aperture, that narrow opening through which the mollusk extends its vulnerable form into the world?  And what of the whorls themselves, those successive coils that comprise the shell?  Can we count them, measure them, and thereby unlock the secrets of the mollusk's development?\n\nWe have sought to answer these questions, to quantify the shape of the shell, to chart the trajectory of the aperture, and to count the whorls.  And in so doing, we have discovered a world of mathematical beauty, a world of abstract forms and geometric shapes.  Like a cartographer charting the unmapped terrain of a foreign land, we have sought to map the contours of the shell, to chart the course of evolution through the dark and unforgiving expanse of time.\n\nOur method, a simple one, yet fraught with complexity.  We view the shell from the apical perspective, that most straightforward of views, and mark the beginning of the first suture.  From this line, we draw a line, and count the whorls, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.  And so, the shell is revealed in all its geometric beauty, a series of apertures that travel through time and space, a spiral that spirals outward from the central axis.\n\nThis trajectory, this path of the aperture, can be graphically and mathematically represented.  And once a mathematical formulation is made, we may vary the parameters, modify the skeletogenesis, and thus unlock the secrets of the mollusk's development.  For in the end, it is not the shell that is the goal, but the understanding that lies within, the understanding of the very essence of life itself.]",
            "The infant's fragile life slipped unnoticed into the abyss, a forgotten statistic lost in the vast expanse of Indonesia's unyielding demographic.  A decade's worth of stagnation had passed, the numbers stubbornly refusing to budge.  The country's forward march towards the Millennium Development Goals was a tale of two trajectories: one of progress, the other of stagnation.  The waters of sanitation had been brought under control, the targets met with a quiet efficiency, but the currents of child and maternal health continued to churn, unmoved by the efforts to stem their tide.  The reasons for this disconnect were many, and the need to shore up the country's health system, rather than merely patching its frayed seams with programmatic interventions, became increasingly clear.\n\nA glimmer of hope flickered in the statistics, a 72% of births attended by skilled hands, the traditional midwives a reminder that even in the most modern of times, the old ways persisted.  But these numbers, too, told a story of untold suffering, of lives lost to the unmet promise of medical intervention.  The hemorrhage that cut short so many lives a silent testament to the limits of midwifery's art.  And the numbers of children under five, their small bodies battered by the relentless onslaught of diarrheal disease, a grim reminder that the fight for their lives was far from won.\n\nThe cesarean section rates, a mere 4%, a statistic that spoke to the deep-seated inequities that ravaged the country's rural heart.  Urban and rural, two worlds apart, the latter a desolate landscape of unmet needs, the former a bastion of privilege.  The 7% in urban settings, a stark contrast to the paltry 2% in rural areas, a stark reminder of the country's failed promise to its most vulnerable citizens.  And the gap, a chasm of 27%, the poorest and richest quintiles worlds apart, their access to healthcare a luxury reserved for the few.\n\nAs the search for solutions continued, the question loomed large: how to close the yawning chasm of service, to bring the healthcare system into the 21st century?  The allure of program-specific approaches, a siren's call to targeted interventions, to cherry-picked solutions, a promise of quick fixes and rapid returns.  But at what cost?  The pitfalls of vertical approaches, the diversion of resources, the hemorrhage of funding from other areas, the siphoning off of human capital, the duplication of services, the labyrinthine paperwork, the suffocating complexity.  The example of HIV/AIDS, a cautionary tale of the unintended consequences of programmatic zeal, the family planning sector a casualty of the international community's misplaced priorities.",
            "In the shadow of the Victorian era, two novels stood apart from the grand tapestry of their brethren - Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Like specters, they loomed, their darkness a counterpoint to the gilded opulence that defined their time.  These works, born of a fevered imagination, bore the scars of a world in flux, where the boundaries between reality and madness were but a whispered secret.  In them, the author's masterful hand wove a tapestry of mystery, an intricate dance of the bizarre and the unknown.\n\nAs the protagonist, Oliver Twist, stumbled through the labyrinthine streets of London, the cacophony of his mind threatened to consume him whole.  The words of Sikes and Crackit still echoed in his ears, a maddening refrain that threatened to unravel the very fabric of his sanity.  And then, like a crack of thunder on a summer's day, the sound of firearms shattered the air, sending a chill through his very marrow.  In the depths of his mind, a maelstrom of visions swirled, a kaleidoscope of light and sound that threatened to dash him to the rocks of despair.  Through it all, a thread of pain ran, a constant heartbeat that tormented him, a reminder that in this world, he was but a fragile, helpless thing.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dream sequences - these glimpses into the abyss - served as a window into the soul of the protagonist.  They revealed the depths of his pain, the terrors that haunted him, and the crushing weight of his ignorance.  When, in chapter 28, Oliver relived the trauma of the shooting, it was as if the very fabric of time had been torn apart, revealing the raw, pulsing wound beneath.  The passage was a brutal reminder of the fragility of life, of the helplessness that lay at its core.  For in that moment, Oliver was but a leaf on the wind, blown about by the whims of fate, his senses dulled, his will shattered.  And in that darkness, the question arose: whose hand had guided him to this place of despair?  Was it his own, or some malevolent force that had seized him, guiding him down a path from which he could not escape?\n\nThe day passed - a fleeting moment, a whispered secret, lost in the shadows.  It was gone, consumed by the endless night, a night that seemed to stretch on forever, a cavernous chasm filled with the whispers of the damned.  And in that darkness, Oliver's fate was sealed, a destiny that seemed to stretch out before him like a cold, unforgiving stone.",
            "The memories of those afternoons spent amidst the sterile glow of fluorescent lights still linger, a faint haze that clings to the skin like the lingering chill of a winter's breeze. It was there, in that desolate landscape of learning, that I chanced upon the tale of Adrian, a boy shrouded in an enigma. His struggle with the written word was a riddle, one that I, with my halting grasp of the alphabet, was powerless to decipher. The letters danced before his eyes, a maddening jumble of sounds and symbols, their meaning lost to him. His English was flawless, a smooth current that flowed effortlessly from his lips, yet his reading was a jarring discord, a cacophony of sounds that defied comprehension.\n\nIt was only when his mother arrived, a woman who spoke in a language that was a foreign tongue to me, that the truth began to unravel. Like a thread pulled loose from a tapestry, the mystery of Adrian's struggles began to reveal itself. His mother's presence was a reminder that the language barrier is a chasm that runs deep, a gulf that separates the world of sound from the world of sense. And it was there, in that moment, that I realized the gravity of the problem: even for those who speak the language with ease, the act of reading can be a daunting task.\n\nThe issue is a canker that festers in the marrow of our education system, a wound that refuses to heal. The solutions, like so many bandages, offer only temporary respite from the pain. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – each one a fragmented attempt to stem the tide of linguistic confusion. And yet, like a river that flows unimpeded, the problem persists.\n\nBut what if we were to approach this issue with a different perspective? What if we were to see the dual language system not as a luxury, but as a necessity? Studies have shown that children enrolled in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers, their minds sharpened by the demands of navigating two languages. The fear of wasting resources, the fear of the unknown, is a specter that haunts our decision-makers. But it is a fear born of ignorance. For if we were to apply this approach on a grand scale, to make it the rule rather than the exception, the benefits would be felt by all.\n\nBut how do we make this a reality? Do we require our teachers to be bilingual, to walk the tightrope of two languages with ease? No, that would be an impossible task, a burden that would drive even the most dedicated educators to despair. But what if we were to provide them with the tools they need? What if we were to offer them the aid of bilingual tutors, language specialists who could bridge the gap between the world of sound and the world of sense?\n\nThe answer lies not in one solution, but in a multitude of approaches, each one a thread in the tapestry of language. It is a complex problem, one that requires a multifaceted solution. But it is a problem that can be solved, if we are willing to approach it with a willingness to learn, to adapt, and to evolve.",
            "The notion of something greater than ourselves is a notion that haunts us from the earliest breaths of our lives. Some of us are shorn of this truth at the altar of Sunday's sabbath, others in the hallowed halls of temples, and still, others within the labyrinthine recesses of their own minds. We are told that which we cannot see, that which lies beyond the reach of our grasping hands, is a thing of beauty, a thing of awe. But some among us reject the handed-down dogma, spurning the notion that there can be a truth greater than our own fleeting perceptions. We flit from one creed to another like moths to a flame, never quite finding our bearings in the darkness.\n\nMy father's eyes, sunken and worn, stared out into the rain as we sat on the creaking porch of our weathered house. The rain drummed against the tin roof, a relentless cadence that seemed to echo the pounding of my own heart. The gutters, swollen with rain, drowned the parched plants that clung to the edge of the porch like supplicants to a cruel god. His voice, a low murmur, spoke of cardinals, of their song, of their beauty. But his eyes, they told a tale of weariness, of a soul beset by the ravages of time. His frame, gaunt and skeletal, seemed to defy the very notion of vitality. I felt a shiver run down my spine, a sense of foreboding that I dare not speak, for to speak would be to acknowledge the abyss that yawned before us.\n\nHe passed on in the cold decay of winter, five days shy of my twenty-second winter's birth. The chemo and radiation, a cruel jest, had prolonged his suffering, stretching out the agony like a rusty wire. What purpose, I wondered, lay in this prolongation? Was it merely a cruel trick, a jest played by some capricious deity? I thought of God, of gods, but knew that they had long since turned their faces away from mine. In the dark of night, I spat out prayers, a futile gesture, an offering to a god that had long since abandoned me.\n\nI had not wanted to witness his passage, to bear witness to the dissolution of the man who had given me life. I had not wanted to see the light fade from his eyes, to watch as the vitality drained from his frame. I knew him better than they, better than his family, and I knew that he would not have wished for me to be a spectator to his demise. I curled up in a ball, a fetal position, and waited for the news, for the cold certainty that would seal my fate.\n\nBut the silence was deafening. No voice, no word, no gentle touch to ease the blow. Only the stillness, a heavy, oppressive stillness that seemed to suffocate me.",
            "In the labyrinthine heart of the literary canon, a paradoxical creature stirs, its essence an oxymoron of antiquity and innovation: the Gothic novel. Ian Watt's astute observation in The Rise of the Gothic Novel has it that this enigmatic form is, in truth, an \"Old-New\" monstrosity, a creature of contradictions that has been both reviled and revered for its alleged lack of depth and its capacity to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The inaugural attempt at this peculiar genre, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, contrived a new method of literary expression by welding the worn, theatrical elements of a bygone era to the nascent, mimetic art of the modern novel. In doing so, Walpole forged a narrative that would become synonymous with the Gothic, its pages infused with the musty scent of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition.\n\nThe term \"Gothic,\" at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, was a cipher, a label affixed to disparate peoples, styles, and epochs, each carrying the taint of archaism and unsophistication in the face of an increasingly modernizing world. Yet it was precisely this oxymoronic fusion – the ancient and the modern – that allowed the Gothic to endure, to persist in its obsolescence, and to present itself anew to each successive generation, a perpetual stranger in a strange land.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic tropes, a leitmotif that courses through the veins of this peculiar genre, is the notion of chivalry. The medieval ideal of the knight, that paragon of valor, honor, and competence, is both preserved and transmuted in Walpole's inaugural Gothic novel. This fetishization of chivalry served as a potent counterpoint to the perceived decay of virtue in the society of Walpole's day, a world beset by politics, faction, and controversy. Through the deployment of chivalric motifs and mannerisms, the Gothic past was transformed into a realm of idealized romance, a fantasy of a bygone era that would serve as a corrective to the perceived shortcomings of the present.\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous era, Walpole's The Castle of Otranto arose, a cri de coeur from a writer beset by the troubles of his time. His characters, those shadowy figures that populate the novel's gothic landscape, embody the chivalric ideals that Walpole saw as lost in his own society. Frederic, that enigmatic prince, is a case in point, his description replete with the trappings of chivalry: a prince, a man of noble birth, beset by tragedy, and said to have fallen to the infidels. His image is an exaggeration, a distortion of the chivalric ideal, a testament to the excesses that would come to define the Gothic genre.",
            "In the desolate expanse of commerce, a labyrinthine dance of goods unfolds, a Sisyphean task of moving the raw materials from the depths of the customer's desire through the crucible of supply, production, and distribution. The term \"supply chain management\" was birthed in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a man who would chart the course of this arduous journey. He described the grand tapestry of planning, implementing, and controlling the intricate web of processes that bind the supply chain together, a symphony of efficiency and satisfaction.\n\nSix pillars stand as the bedrock of this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The masterful manipulation of these elements is the domain of the manager, a conductor guiding the orchestra of commerce towards the sublime goal of customer satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the initial step in this odyssey, is the foundation upon which the entire edifice is built. It is here that the when, why, where, and how of creation are determined, a delicate balance of art and science. The manager must first divine the desires of the customer, a task that requires gazing into the abyss of the market, a vast and unforgiving expanse that holds the secrets of demand and desire. Once the market's whispers have been deciphered, the manager must decide what products shall be born, and in what quantity, a decision that holds the power to shape the very fabric of the supply chain.\n\nThe location of production is a decision of utmost importance, a choice that must be made with the customer's satisfaction in mind. The manager must weigh the options, balancing the scales of volume and quality, as the fate of the product hangs precariously in the balance. And once the location has been determined, the manager must turn their attention to the scheduling of workloads and the maintenance of equipment, a Sisyphean task that requires ceaseless vigilance.\n\nSupply, the second pillar of this edifice, is a realm of strategic decision-making, where the core capabilities of a facility are determined and partnerships are forged. A company may be a vast, sprawling entity, with multiple divisions working in tandem to create a single product. The manager must navigate this Byzantine landscape, determining which division is best suited to each task, and whether to outsource to other companies, a choice that holds the power to create velocity, that elusive goal of quality and flexibility at a reduced cost.\n\nIn this intricate dance, every detail is vital, a single misstep threatening to unravel the entire web of commerce. The examples of Wal-Mart and Target, two retail behemoths, illustrate the importance of outlining processes, a choreographed ballet of efficiency and expectation. Without this careful planning, the whole edifice risks collapse, a descent into chaos and confusion.",
            "A desolate sign, scrawled on a piece of cardboard held aloft by Ellen Page's lone figure, made its claim: \"Hitler lives in Burma\". The words, scoured into the surface with a Sharpie's coarse tip, seemed a travesty against the verdant backdrop of Myanmar's cities. Yet, in a place where the tattered remnants of democracy clung to life like a worn shroud, such a pronouncement was not without precedent. \n\nIn this, the Southeastern Asian nation's tortured history, the junta's iron grip had ruled since '62, its ascent born of blood and coup. And in '07, a spark of resistance flared, a flame that would be known as the Saffron Revolution, its name taken from the saffron robes of the monks who led the charge. The protests, a rarity in a decade of silence, slowly gathered momentum, drawing in the public's attention like moths to a dying flame. But the government's tolerance wore thin, its patience exhausted by the people's defiance. The violence that followed was a maelstrom, with the military laying waste to monasteries and foreign journalists rounded up, their cameras and notebooks seized, their bodies silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, met his end on a street corner, his crime a simple presence at a protest. The official tally of dead stood at 13, a figure that Colonel Hla Win, a man who had defected from the junta's ranks, would later dispute, his words a whispered truth in a world where lies were currency. \"Many more,\" he said, \"have perished in the shadows, their bodies lost to the wind and the dust.\"\n\nIt is a refrain that echoes through the ages, a litany of horror and bloodshed, a testament to the human heart's capacity for cruelty. From the Roman emperors, who claimed the gods as their patrons, to the Japanese emperors, who were said to be gods themselves, and the leaders of our own time, who speak in hushed tones of their divine right to rule. The examples are legion, a litany of violence and oppression that spans centuries: Tiananmen's Square, where students and intellectuals clashed with the Chinese government's iron fist; the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militiamen, backed by their government, slaughtered Tutsis and moderates alike; and the Third Reich, a dark chapter in human history, where the very notion of humanity was warped and distorted.",
            "In the shadow of Duke Ellington's extended lifespan, a legacy arose like a slow-burning ember that suffused the jazz world with an unyielding brilliance. The piano's subtle whispers in his compositions belied a creative force that honed the individual talents of his orchestra, shaping them into a cohesive unit that danced with precision and abandon. Ellington's mastery of the ensemble's inner workings allowed him to craft frameworks for soloists to unfurl their improvisations, alongside tightly-wound phrases that conjured the unique timbres of each musician. His ear was a sieve, sifting through the disparate sounds to distill a singular tone that animated each piece, imbuing them with a sense of purpose and coherence.\n\nThe Creole Love Call, an early exemplar of Ellington's innovations, stands as testament to his audacious use of voice as a jazz instrument. This slow-burning twelve-bar blues, with its six choruses, slowly unwinds like a parched landscape after a summer storm. The first chorus unfurls a call-and-response dialogue between voice and reeds, the voice's smooth melodic lines giving way to a rougher, more guttural timbre towards its end. The second chorus unfolds like a dark, sweeping cloud, the muted trumpet solo a somber elegy that subsides into a quiet reverie. In the third, a clarinet solo soars in the upper register, its syncopated piano accompaniment a subtle undercurrent that underscores the music's fluid tensions. The full band echoes the first chorus in the fourth, the brass and reed sections trading calls and responses like the gentle lapping of waves against a deserted shore.\n\nIn the fifth chorus, the reeds take the lead, their high-register calls and responses punctuated by the staccato bursts of the brass and rhythm sections, like the sharp, staccato beat of a desert wind. And in the final chorus, the voice reverts to its earlier, smooth timbre, its growling, instrumental quality a testament to Ellington's sorcery in bending the human voice to the service of his music. A final, brief tag concludes the piece, a vocal run and dissonant novelty ending that hangs like a whispered secret in the music's fading embers.\n\nHot and Bothered, recorded a year later, further showcases Ellington's deft orchestration and his ear for tone color. Here, \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing entwine in a call-and-response phrase, their vocal and instrumental aspects commingling in a rich, complementary whole. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends this idea, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introducing the melody with a wistful, melancholic air that draws the listener inexorably into the music's depths.",
            "A void had gnawed within her, a hunger that refused to be sated. It had begun to manifest itself when she was still a girl, a spark of discontent that flickered to life like a flame in the darkness. By the time the weight of seventeen summers had settled upon her shoulders, the emptiness had taken on a shape, a yearning for connection that refused to be assuaged. Yet, the faces that swirled around her, the boys who offered their awkward solicitations, held no allure, no siren's call that could lure her in. She pondered the enigma, a riddle that refused to yield its secrets, and wondered if she was cursed, if some affliction had been visited upon her.\n\nAt home, the days unwound in a tranquil rhythm, the only discordant note the occasional friction between her own wild spirit and the calm that reigned over her parents. They were a gentle couple, their love a flame that burned bright and true, but her own fire, a conflagration of laughter and rebellion, threatened to scorch the garden of their serenity. Today, however, was not a day of quietude. As she moved through the rooms, a disturbance in the air, a discordant note that threatened to shatter the stillness. A scream, her mother's voice, cut through the silence like a knife, and she rushed to the kitchen, her heart racing with fear.\n\nIn the kitchen, her mother lay on the floor, a crumpled figure, her voice a low, anguished mewling. \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to...the hospital.\" The words were torn from her lips, a plea that spoke to the depths of her pain. Her daughter rushed to her side, her hand a steadying presence, and lifted her, cradling her as if she were a child. \"Where can I find you, Mom?\" The mother's hands, trembling, pointed the way, and she carried her, a weight that was both fragile and precious, to the car.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent, a stench of sickness and fear, enveloped her like a shroud, but she was unfazed, her mind fixed on her mother's fragile form. She laid her on a gurney, called out to the doctors, and watched as they sprang into action, their faces set with concern. The sounds of the hospital, a cacophony of beeps and murmurs, swirled around her, but she was oblivious, her focus solely on her mother's suffering. It was a fall, a simple accident, her mother had said, a vase from the top shelf, a stepping stool, and a sudden, precipitous drop. But to her, it was a small miracle that her mother was alive, a reminder that life was a fragile, brittle thing, and that the spaces between breaths were all that stood between us and the abyss.",
            "In a vast expanse of time, where the rhythms of existence are governed by the whims of the heart, a phenomenon had come to light - that the adherence to a certain way of eating, a diet born of the Mediterranean sun, might hold the power to ward off the specter of chronic heart disease and stroke, those twin harbingers of mortality. This was the premise of a study, one that would seek to quantify the relationship between the \"Mediterranean Diet\" and the scourge of cardiovascular afflictions.\n\nThe diet in question, a modified iteration of the original, had come to be known as the \"alternate Mediterranean\" or \"aMed\" diet. It was characterized by a preponderance of plant-based sustenance - the verdant bounty of fruits, the richness of nuts, the wholesome goodness of whole grains and legumes - alongside an abundance of monounsaturated fats, the gentle solace of fish, and the sparing use of animal products and saturated fats. A moderate indulgence in the fleeting pleasures of alcohol was also permitted.\n\nPrevious studies, those diligent sentinels of the medical community, had long since noted an inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. One intervention trial, a bold experiment in the art of dietetics, had even shown the Mediterranean diet to be a more potent ally in the fight against weight loss and the regulation of cholesterol levels in the obese. However, these studies had neglected to focus on the specter of stroke, that most insidious of afflictions.\n\nThis epidemiological study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of data, followed a cohort of 74,886 women, women who had been drawn into the orbit of the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and venerable project that had been monitoring the health of 121,700 female nurses across 11 states for nigh on two decades. Over the course of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers had computed an aMed diet score for these women, using a series of self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" that had been designed to capture the nuances of their dietary habits.\n\nThe questionnaire, that most intimate of instruments, had been subjected to validation studies, its efficacy in capturing the subtleties of nutritional intake having been rigorously tested. Reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke, those most grievous of afflictions, had been confirmed through a meticulous review of medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Where these records had been absent, cases had been deemed \"probable\" and included, a necessary concession to the imperfections of the human record.\n\nA host of other factors, those confounding variables that can distort the truth of a study, had been accounted for: body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity had been assessed, a vital component in the calculus of health.\n\nTo reduce the random variation that can beset the data, the researchers had computed cumulative averages of the aMed score, averaging together scores from two prior years. This had allowed them to capture the long-term dietary habits of the women, to tease out the signal from the noise.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical technique of rare elegance, had been employed to assess the association between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke. Separate models had been used for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke, a nuanced approach that had allowed the researchers to tease out the subtleties of the relationship.\n\nAnd so it was found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected in a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in women. Over the course of 20 years, 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths had been recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile, those who had most closely approximated the ideals of the Mediterranean diet, were at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In the depths of a country beset by insatiable greed and short-sightedness, a calamity of unyielding ferocity befell the United States of America in the year 2007. A maelstrom of unemployment, a housing market reduced to ruin, and behemoths of corporate industry brought low - the particulars of this national convulsion still linger in the dark recesses of our collective memory. It is a question, then, that demands an answer: how did this cataclysm unfold, and what might be done to stem its aftershocks? The malady, in its essence, was born of unwholesome decisions, a concatenation of selfish and naive actions that coaxed banks and financial titans into issuing sub-prime loans to those who should not have been granted such favor, into a financial infrastructure woefully unprepared to support the weight of such an endeavor.\n\nThe government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were similarly ensnared, their mandate to underwrite and repackage these dubious mortgages into CDO's and CDS's a Faustian bargain that would come to haunt them. As the borrowers defaulted on these ill-fated loans, the banks found themselves bereft of capital reserves, and the contagion was thus spread to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and on to the economy at large.\n\nThe roots of this calamity run deep, to the year 1999, when the Clinton administration, driven by a hunger for re-election, loosened the reins of lending, sowing the seeds of a sub-prime crisis that would germinate seven years later. In a prescient article published in that same year, Steven Holmes of the New York Times foresaw the perils of this course of action: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people, and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes's words, a Cassandra's warning, prophesied the very fate that would befall the nation: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nA multitude of factors contributed to the economy's precipitous decline, not the least of which was the Byzantine complexity of the mortgage market itself. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) - each a puzzle piece in the grand edifice of financial sorcery - entwined the economy in a Gordian knot, leaving households and financial markets perilously over-leveraged, vulnerable to the slightest tremors in the housing market.\n\nAnd then, the inevitable occurred: the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the ruin they had wrought. The top five U.S. investment banks, their coffers drained by $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, a staggering 30% of the nation's GDP, were left to pick up the pieces. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, their mortgage debt a staggering $5 trillion, were placed under government control in September 2008, a grim testament to the hubris of a system that had forgotten the lesson of its own mortality.",
            "In the desolate expanse of narrative, there exists a place where the writer's voice grows weak, where the words blur together like dust swirling in the wind.  It is the province of exposition, a pitfall that can swallow the reader whole, leaving only a faint recollection of having been there.  Dr. Merlin's fingers dance across the keyboard, her eyes scanning the screen with a mixture of frustration and despair as she succumbs to the siren's call of Too Much Information.\n\nExposition is a specter that haunts the writer, a whisper in the ear that urges haste, that promises to condense the tale into something palatable, something digestible.  It is not a friend, but a foe that saps the life from the story, leaving it a hollow shell of what it once was.  The \"Show, don't tell\" mantra echoes through the chambers of the writer's mind, a reminder of the dangers of indulging in the excesses of exposition.\n\nConsider the example of the heroine, her meeting with her beloved a distant memory, a moment lost in the haze of time.  The author's words, once meant to breathe life into this encounter, instead suffocate it, stifling the reader's connection to the characters.  The husband's character is introduced in a blur, a mere outline of a man, his love for his wife reduced to a few hastily scribbled lines of dialogue.  The reader is given no reason to mourn his passing, no insight into the bond that tied him to his wife, no glimpse into the depths of their relationship.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the writer's words are the only respite from the void.  It is here that the author must provide the meat, the substance that gives the story its weight.  To rush past the details, to gloss over the intricacies of character, is to risk losing the reader forever.  The temptation is great, the allure of brevity and concision a siren's call that beckons the writer to sacrifice depth for the sake of expediency.  But it is in the slow, deliberate dance of exposition that the writer must find the rhythm of the story, the beat that gives it life.\n\nAs the writer sits, fingers poised over the keyboard, the specter of exposition looms large, a constant reminder of the dangers of excess.  It is a temptation that must be resisted, a pitfall that must be avoided.  For it is in the act of creation that the writer finds true power, in the slow, deliberate dance of words that bring the story to life.",
            "I watched the morning broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on that sweltering August 13, 2011. The NBC 4 news had presented a story that seemed an anomaly in its brevity - a tale of a man named Shad Hostettler who had laid low in a frenzy of bloodlust, his wife the victim of his hand. The images of him, taken in the aftermath of his arrest, spoke of a man consumed by some dark and primal urge. The broadcaster devoted but a fleeting moment to this unfolding tragedy, as if the weight of it were too much to bear. Yet, in the cold calculus of the telecast, two minutes was a sufficing allotment for a life shattered.\n\nThe next story, too, seemed a pale shadow of its brethren. A youth, Travis Buyers, 18, had been cut down in the Sharon Woods, his body ravaged by the ravages of violence. The authorities had yet to ensnare the perpetrator, and the trail was growing cold. The city's SWAT team navigated the darkened streets, searching for answers that seemed, to the naked eye, elusive. I could not help but notice the economy with which this story was told, its brevity a stark reminder of the manner in which the city's underbelly is oftentimes shrouded in silence.\n\nA third story, that of a Med-Flight helicopter riddled by the slugs of a .22 caliber rifle, served as a stark reminder of the city's violence. A reward, five thousand dollars, was offered for any information that might lead to the capture of the perpetrator. It was a paltry sum, a token gesture in a city where the value of life seemed to be measured in the most crass of terms.\n\nThe forecaster's words, a litany of rain and thunderstorms, served as a jarring counterpoint to the tales of violence that had preceded it. The city would be beset by the elements, the temperatures a steady mid-eighties, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, nature's indifference remains a constant.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF, perpetrated by a dark-skinned man, his features obscured by a hoodie, served as a stark reminder of the manner in which the city's underclass is oftentimes reduced to a composite sketch. The details of his appearance seemed an afterthought, a mere embellishment to an already gruesome tale.\n\nLastly, the story of Rene Rodriguez, a man convicted of trafficking marijuana from Texas to Ohio, served as a testament to the city's eternal fascination with the darker corners of human existence. His sentence, a staggering 300 months, seemed a number plucked from the ether, a cipher that spoke to the city's own moral calculus. His ethnicity, a mere aside, a footnote to a tale that seemed, at its core, a story of the human condition.",
            "The bond between brothers is a rope of twisted threads, torn and frayed, yet unyielding in its grasp. It weaves together a tapestry of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, a brocade of contradictions that can never be unraveled. In the crucible of hardship, the nature of this bond is revealed, its true face a twisted visage of good and evil. The cost of these emotions is a burden that must be borne, a weight that presses down upon the shoulders of those who dare to love and be loved. It is in the depths of this bond that one sees the unvarnished truth, a reflection of oneself in the eyes of another, a mirror held up to the soul. In the actions and their consequences, a man's character is forged, like iron in the fire.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is laid bare, a tale of two brothers set against a backdrop of a lush, unforgiving landscape. Theirs is a journey of bitter disappointment and unyielding pride, a reckoning that ends in blood and dust. The narrator's gaze is a microscope, laying bare the complexities of the human heart, the tangled web of emotions that drives us forward. The protagonist's actions, a litany of resentment and love, are a testament to the power of this bond.\n\nHis was a dream of a brother, a companion to share in the wild joys of youth, to run and jump and climb the vines of Old Woman Swamp. But Doodle's fragile heart, a ticking time bomb, made such dreams a distant memory. The protagonist's anger and frustration seethed like a pot left unwatched, a slow-burning fire that threatened to consume them both. He had considered the unthinkable, a dark thought that lurked in the recesses of his mind, a monstrous impulse that recoiled in shame. Yet, in Doodle's smile, a spark of hope flickered to life, a flame that warmed the cold stone of his heart. It was a fleeting moment, a glimpse of the love that lay beneath the surface, a love that would ultimately be the protagonist's undoing.",
            "In the vast and labyrinthine recesses of the human cranium, a maelstrom of activity stirs, a dizzying vortex of thought and perception. The ancients, in their nascent understanding, likened the mind to a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a tome bound in worn leather, and finally, to the cold, calculating machinery of the computer. But these metaphors, like wisps of smoke on the wind, are fleeting and treacherous, apt to lead us astray with their simplistic certainties.\n\nThe process begins with the sensory organs, those sensitive antennae that drink in the world around us – the tactile thrum of skin, the warmth of sunlight, the cacophony of sound, the radiance of light. From these primal sensations, a cascade of electrochemical signals unfurls, like a river bursting forth from its source. The brain, a maze of twisted pathways and hidden chambers, processes this information with a logic both elegant and brutal, oscillating between the bottom-up and top-down currents of perception.\n\nConsider, for instance, the fleeting image of a black box on a white background. The bottom-up torrent, like a torrent of rainwater, gathers in the simplest elements – the color, the orientation, the borders that define the shape – and from these, the mind constructs the box. But top-down, the more considered, more deliberate process, overlays this nascent perception with the weight of prior knowledge, guiding the recognition of the box as a thing, rather than a mere void.\n\nAnd yet, the brain's attention, a filter thin as a veil, determines which signals are worthy of consideration, which are relegated to the shadows. We may perceive each blade of grass beneath our feet, but only the urgent whisper of our name, in a world of din and noise, holds our attention. The brain's pathways, like a labyrinth, twist and turn, with each step, each decision, modulating the flow of information, a perpetual dance of give and take.\n\nBut how is this information stored, this flux of perception and understanding? There are the chambers of memory, a vast and labyrinthine repository of experience and knowledge. And within these chambers, the processes of encoding and maintenance unfold. The sensory stimuli, like tokens in a game, are inscribed with meaning – the structural tracing of words, the phonemic echoes of sound, the semantic resonance of meaning. And once stored, this knowledge must be maintained, sustained by the ephemeral electrical signals that pulse through the neural networks, a fleeting, flickering spark of life.\n\nThere are those who propose models of the mind's organization, theories born of observation and conjecture. The semantic network, a web of connections, a vast and intricate tapestry, posits that concepts are nodes, linked by threads of association – \"chair\" to \"table,\" \"table\" to \"wooden,\" and so on. But these models, like the metaphors that precede them, are but fragile approximations, pale reflections of the mind's infinite complexity.",
            "In the desolate expanse of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley conjures a dystopian nightmare born of the unholy trinity of technology, capitalism, and the insidious World State. The denizens of this godforsaken world are reduced to mere pawns, their every whim catered to, their desires shaped by the cold, calculating hand of the World Controller. Community supplants individuality, a hollow substitute for the authentic self, and the pursuit of happiness becomes a mindless, vacant drone, a parody of the human experience.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist dialectics, the façade of this supposed utopia reveals its true colours: a suffocating web of ideological control, where the few, the privileged and the powerful, manipulate the many, the voiceless and the downtrodden. The lexicon of Marxism – homogeny, reification, false consciousness – echoes through the narrative, a litany of condemnation for the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. The conditioning of the populace, a relentless drumbeat of hypnopædia, numbs the senses, rendering the lower classes impotent, their wills reduced to mere acquiescence, as they are driven to consume, to spend, to indulge.\n\nThe notion of hegemony writ large, where the dominant class holds sway over all, is starkly apparent in Brave New World. The upper echelons, the Alphas and Betas, are complicit in their own oppression, their privilege a shield against the weight of their culpability. Few, like Bernard, dare to question the status quo, while the rest remain enthralled, their senses dulled by the relentless barrage of consumerist propaganda.\n\nRelationships in this bleak world are reduced to a mere facade, a shallow masquerade of human connection. The characters, even the ostensibly prominent ones, are one-dimensional, their depths unexplored, their emotions stunted. Love, passion, and true connection are nonexistent, replaced by the hollow, vacuous interactions that masquerade as human experience. The men's comments on women are reduced to lascivious, reductionist remarks, while the women's thoughts are a litany of shallow, self-aggrandizing musings. The complacency of the societal classes, their acceptance of their predetermined roles, is a stark indictment of the dehumanizing effects of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, the proletariat, conditioned to believe in their own superiority, toil in ignorance, their chains forged from the very ideologies that bind them. The World State, that behemoth of capitalist machinations, has succeeded in reducing humanity to a state of acquiescence, a sea of faceless, soulless drones, their thoughts, their desires, their very humanity, reduced to nothing more than a distant memory.",
            "The desolate expanse of University Park, a landscape of concrete and steel, stretches out before me like an unforgiving vastness. Four and a half semesters have passed since I first set foot on this unforgiving terrain, and still, the perils of navigating its twisted paths persist. As a freshman, I was consigned to the farthest reaches of East Halls, a dormitory huddled on the eastern extremity of campus, its isolation a testament to the indifference of a behemoth institution. The meager confines of Stuart Hall, my erstwhile home, seemed a world away from the hallowed halls of Willard, where the distant din of learning echoed through the corridors. The journey between these disparate points, a meandering odyssey of 25 minutes on foot, was a tribulation best faced on the most clement of days. And even then, the threat of inclement weather loomed, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of this place. But the truth, like the wind that whispers through the trees, was that the East Halls had once stood apart, a solitary outpost on the outskirts of campus. The intervening years have seen the intervening lands transformed into a tangle of sports fields, monolithic buildings, and residential monoliths, a testament to the inexorable expansion of this sprawling metropolis.\n\nAnd so, the problem persists, a Sisyphean task of traversing this unforgiving landscape. The bicycle, a humble steed, offers a glimmer of hope in this desolate expanse. But it is a tool, a mere instrument, and one that requires the user to be willing to utilize it. The campus, too, must be remade in its image, a topography that acknowledges the needs of its most vulnerable travelers. The words of a fellow traveler, a friend who had lately rediscovered the joys of pedaling, still lingered in my mind. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, his voice laced with conviction, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And so, I found myself drawn to the bicycle, a siren's call in a sea of concrete.\n\nAs I navigated the twisted roads of Pollock, a ribbon of asphalt that stretched before me like a gauntlet, I was reminded of the perils of this existence. The bike, once a novelty, had become an indispensable adjunct to my daily routine. The 25-minute walk to Thomas building, a veritable eternity in the eyes of a student, was reduced to a mere 5 minutes of pedaling fury. But the road, a cruel mistress, was unforgiving, her twists and turns a constant threat to the unwary cyclist. And yet, I pressed on, driven by the knowledge that without this trusty steed, I would be at the mercy of the pedestrian's plodding pace. The hours, like grains of sand in an hourglass, would slip away, lost to the void of walking, a Sisyphean task that would consume my very existence. No, the bicycle was my only solace, a fragile lifeline in a sea of concrete and steel."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The path I have chosen to pursue is a hard one, a winding road that threads its way through the darkest reaches of human suffering. It is a journey into the heart of the Division of Family and Children Services, where the wounds of abuse and neglect run deep. It is here that I intend to make my stand, a solitary figure in a world of shattered lives. The values that guide me are few, but they burn like embers in the darkness: service, a steadfast commitment to the welfare of others; respect, a profound reverence for the inherent dignity of every human soul; an ethical nature, a determination to walk the narrow path of right and wrong; and a commitment to the ceaseless pursuit of self-improvement, that I might remain a instrument of healing in a world that so often seems bent on destruction.\n\nFor years, I wandered, lost in a wilderness of uncertainty, unsure of the purpose that drove me. I watched as those around me turned away from the abyss, their faces averted from the abyss of human suffering. But I saw it, this abyss, and it haunted me. It was in these moments of clarity that I knew I had to act, to take up the burden of another's pain. I turned to the study of Psychology, a discipline that would allow me to grasp the complexities of the human heart. But even with this knowledge, I remained uncertain, a leaf blown by the wind. It was not until I witnessed the fragile form of a sixteen-year-old boy, his eyes wide with fear, that I knew my path was set. He had fled his home, desperate to escape the cruelty that lurked within its walls. I saw in him a reflection of the darkness that lurked within myself, a reminder that I too had been lost, that I too had known the sting of abandonment.\n\nIt was in this moment that I knew I had to act, to take up the mantle of a social worker. I drove to the boy's parents' house, my heart heavy with foreboding. The police were there, their faces a mask of indifference. I poured out my concerns to them, my words a plea to the void. They listened, their expressions unreadable. And then I spoke to the parents, their eyes averted, their words a tangled web of deceit. I saw in them the same darkness that I had seen in the boy, the same cruelty that had driven him to flee.\n\nThis experience shook me to my core. It was then that I knew I had to dedicate myself to the pursuit of social justice, to stand against the tide of oppression that threatened to consume us all. I had always known that I was different, that I refused to be bound by the constraints of societal expectations. I had protested, in my own small way, against the injustices that I saw around me. I had dyed my hair, worn clothes that spoke to my soul, pierced my ears, and stood against the tide of homophobia, racism, and discrimination. And now, in this moment of clarity, I knew that I had to continue this fight, to stand against the forces of oppression that threatened to consume us all.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the human experience, there exists a affliction that shrouds the mind and body in an impenetrable darkness - insomnia. This malady, born of the complexities of the biological and sociocultural, defies easy categorization, its tendrils creeping into the very fabric of our existence. The biological model, a cold and unforgiving mistress, seeks to unravel the Gordian knot of genetic predisposition and physiological imperatives that govern our slumber. The hypothalamus, a seat of primal urges and instincts, holds sway over the delicate balance of sleep and wakefulness, its neurons whispering ancient secrets to the insomniac's fevered brain.\n\nA study, conducted in the sterile confines of a laboratory, peered into the recesses of the mice's neural realm, where the orexin neurons, like sentinels of the dark, ruled over the kingdom of sleep. The presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons, a genetic legacy that echoes through the ages, held the key to the mystery of slumber. The activation of the GABAA receptor, a whispered incantation that conjured the somnambulant state, was a potent balm for the troubled mind. The inhibition of this receptor, a shadowy figure that stalked the dreams of the insomniac, brought forth a reduction in anxiety, a fleeting respite from the crushing weight of wakefulness.\n\nThe GABAB agonist, a chemical sorcery that wove its spell upon the mice, extended the duration of sleep, a fleeting respite from the desolate landscape of wakefulness. The implications of this study, a whispered promise of hope in the darkness, hinted at a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence in this receptor, a flaw in the fabric of existence, could unravel the very fabric of sleep, leaving the insomniac shrouded in an impenetrable veil of wakefulness.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study, a shadowy apparition that haunted the fringes of our understanding, suggested that the inherited phenotype of the GABAB receptor held sway over the insomniac's fate, a cruel mistress that governed the rhythms of existence. The disturbance of this receptor, a whispered secret in the dead of night, would unleash a maelstrom of consequences, a ravaging of the very fabric of life - the monotony of school, the drudgery of work, the suffocating tedium of daily existence.",
            "In the shadows of the mind, a silent affliction lurks, one that shrouds the clarity of sound in a veil of confusion. Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, is a specter that haunts the realm of the brain, where the whispers of the world are lost in the din of disarray. It is a condition wherein the central nervous system, that most mysterious of territories, falters in its duty to unpack the tangled threads of sound, leaving the sufferer lost in a labyrinth of misheard meanings.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this affliction were first spoken in the hushed tones of the 1950s, when researchers began to probe the depths of auditory imperception. It was a nascent understanding, a glimmer of light in the darkness, that would eventually coalesce into the defined boundaries of CAPD. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari were among the first to chart the uncharted territories of this disorder, their maps guiding the way for those who would follow in their footsteps. The year 1961 saw the introduction of dichotic testing, a method that would become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of this most insidious of conditions.\n\nBut what are the telltale signs of this hidden foe? They are many, and varied, like the shifting sands of the desert. The sufferer may stumble in the darkness, unable to pinpoint the source of a sound; they may mistake the gentle breeze of a whispered secret for the crashing waves of a distant storm; they may falter in the face of conflicting rhythms, unable to discern the subtle nuances of tone and timbre. They may be unable to weave the threads of sound into a coherent tapestry, to synthesize the disparate elements into a meaningful whole. And they may be lost in the maze of sequence, unable to discern the order in which sounds present themselves.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a delicate dance, a patient hunt for signs of a disorder that is as elusive as a ghost. The audiologist, the SLP, the psychologist, and others must employ a variety of methods to unravel the tangled threads of the sufferer's perception. They must observe the subtlest of behaviors, the faintest of responses, and they must rely on the most advanced of technologies to uncover the hidden truths of the brain. The tests are many, and the tools are varied, but there is no one silver bullet, no single test that can pinpoint the source of this affliction with absolute certainty. And so the search continues, a relentless pursuit of understanding in the face of a disorder that is as enigmatic as the human mind itself.",
            "The playwright's pen dips into the darkness of deception, revealing the precarious balance between the self and the masks we wear. Twelfth Night poses a haunting question: in the depths of subterfuge, where do we find ourselves lost, and where do we find redemption? The heart's desire to protect itself from the cruel hands of fate often leads us down a path of disguise, where the lines between truth and lies are blurred. Yet, in this twilight world, one must confront the specter of isolation, the ghostly whispers of those we deceive, who may never forgive our transgressions.\n\nThe masquerade of gender, a fragile dance of identity, raises the stakes of deception. Viola's desperate gamble, a cry for survival in a foreign land, sets in motion a chain of events that will forever alter the course of her existence. She dons the guise of a man, a fragile armor that shields her from the predators that stalk the shadows. But in doing so, she sacrifices the solace of her own kind, the warmth of sisterly love and the gentle ministrations of women who could have been her allies. And so, she becomes a stranger in a strange land, a phantom among phantoms, her true self a distant memory, lost in the labyrinth of her own making.\n\nOlivia, a princess of elegance and refinement, becomes a willing pawn in Viola's game of deception. She is drawn to the mystery of Cesario, the boy who has captured her heart, but does she truly love the man, or the illusion of a man? The playwright's intentions are shrouded in ambiguity, leaving the audience to ponder the depths of Olivia's desires. Is she a victim of her own societal pressures, forced to conform to the expectations of those who would judge her? Or is she a willing participant in the charade, a master of the masquerade, who uses her wit and cunning to navigate the treacherous waters of love and desire?\n\nAs the play unfolds, the threads of deception become increasingly entangled, a tapestry of lies and half-truths that threaten to consume us all. In the end, it is not the preservation of relationships that matters, but the preservation of the self, a self that is ever-changing, ever-shifting, like the sands of the desert. And so, we are left to ponder the question: what lies at the heart of our own deceptions, and at the heart of our own desires?\n\nIn the silence of the night, we hear the whispers of Viola's confession: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) The words hang in the air like a challenge, a reminder that in the darkest depths of our own hearts, we too may be hiding, waiting for the moment to reveal our true selves, or to succumb to the shadows that haunt us.\n\nThe language of the text is heavy with the weight of ambiguity, leaving the reader to question the nature of deception and the masks we wear. And so, we are left to ponder the words of Olivia, a woman of mystery and intrigue: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) Is it a gesture of love, or a gesture of acceptance? Only the playwright knows, and the truth remains hidden, lost in the shadows of the human heart.",
            "The shadow of German colonial rule stretched across a continent, its darkness deepening with each passing year. The heavy hand of oppression, particularly in the annals of South West Africa, left an indelible mark, a genocide of unimaginable proportions perpetrated against the Ovaherero and Nama. And yet, this is but a faint glimpse into the labyrinthine complexities of a colonial empire that defied categorization. A hydra-like beast, its policies and governing styles as varied as the landscapes it claimed. The provision of education, too, was a patchwork of contrasts, a quilt stitched together from disparate threads.\n\nWhen the British inherited German East Africa in 1919, they found a population of Africans who had been schooled in the ways of literacy and knowledge. The German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were lauded by contemporaries, their praises echoing through the annals of history. Yet, in South West Africa, the situation was akin to a desolate wasteland. Unlike the verdant East Africa, where the government had taken an active role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa, the responsibility was left to the missionary societies, their meager support a testament to the colonial administration's apathy.\n\nThe government, however, did not neglect its own kind. In South West Africa, it invested heavily in the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and lavishing support upon the missionary institutions that served them. This dualistic approach would have far-reaching consequences, shaping the destiny of South West Africa long after the German rule had faded. While other colonies boasted of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa stood apart, its population largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The factors that contributed to this divergence were as complex as they were multifaceted, a tangled web of social, political, and economic forces that would be the focus of this inquiry.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is a vast and sprawling landscape, with works written in German dominating the early years of the colonial era. These early studies, penned in the early twentieth century, were primarily concerned with cataloging the features of the educational systems in the various colonies. Later, English-language works expanded the discourse, offering comparative studies and detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. Among these, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out, a seminal work that shed light on the factors that differentiated the two colonies. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a primary factor behind the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its temperate climate and arid expanses, presented a paradox. A land of contrasts, where the European population thrived, numbering nearly 15,000 by 1913, while the settler population in East Africa, the next largest, struggled to reach 5,336. This dichotomy would have far-reaching consequences, forming the backdrop against which the story of education in South West Africa would unfold.",
            "In the scorched expanse of a century, popular music has sprawled forth like a vast, twisted thicket, its branches tangled in an impenetrable thicket of genres. The taxonomy of this morass is a Sisyphean task, as most of the established genres – rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – have spawned a labyrinthine array of sub-genres, each one a labyrinthine offshoot of the last. And yet, it was in this maelstrom that heavy metal arose, a behemoth of sound that has come to embody the darker, more visceral aspects of the human experience.\n\nOver the past four decades, this sub-genre has evolved into a hydra-headed beast, its tendrils reaching out to ensnare a vast array of influences, from the primal howls of the devil's music to the ornate, baroque flourishes of the Romantic Era. And yet, at its core, metal remains a music of darkness, a sound that revels in the shadows, that conjures forth a world of midnight bleakness and desolation.\n\nIt is a music of excess, of overblown bombast and volume, of a primal, unbridled energy that threatens to consume all in its path. It is a music of the damned, of the forsaken, of those who dwell in the twilight realms of the human experience. And it is this very darkness that has drawn countless musicians to its fold, each one seeking to tap into the wellspring of sound that lies at metal's heart.\n\nThe earliest manifestations of this movement – the Beatles' 'Helter Skelter', the Rolling Stones' own 'Sympathy for the Devil' – were but tentative explorations of the darker side of the human experience. But it was the excesses of the 1970's, the psychedelic boom that swept across the land like a wildfire, that truly ignited the metal movement, imbuing it with a sense of reckless abandon and creative freedom. It was a music that reveled in the madness, that sought to push the boundaries of what was possible, to create a sound that was at once beautiful and brutal, sublime and profane.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves lost in this wilderness of sound, a labyrinthine maze of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, each one a reflection of the metal movement's boundless creativity, its refusal to be bound by the constraints of convention. It is a music that defies categorization, that resists summary, that simply is. And it is this very essence that has captured the hearts and minds of countless musicians, each one drawn to the siren song of metal, to its promise of darkness, of excess, of the unknown.",
            "In the twilight of a bygone era, a man's brush danced across canvas, birthing worlds of dreams and reveries that would soon beget a surrealist's fevered imaginings. Henri Rousseau, a painter of unassuming beginnings, wove his own tapestry of longing and aspiration, a testament to the burning desire that fuels the artist's soul. His magnum opus, The Dream, a painting born of 1910, stands as a chronicle of his inner turmoil, a struggle that would haunt him throughout his artistic existence: to submit to the conventions of the art world he so devoutly admired, or to chart his own unfettered course, a path that would lead him down a road of uncharted waters.\n\nTo grasp the essence of The Dream, one must first traverse the desolate landscape of Rousseau's life, a terrain marked by hardship and the unyielding pursuit of artistic expression. Born on a day like any other, May 21, 1844, in the forgotten village of Laval, northwest France, Henri Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer, a man who knew the value of a hard-earned coin. His early years were a blur of toil and labor, a gabelou's drudgery, a municipal toll collector's monotony. Yet, in the stillness of his heart, a flame of creativity flickered, a fire that would not be extinguished. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, a tragedy that would leave him bereft and broken, only intensified his longing for a new beginning, a chance to escape the suffocating shadows of his past. And so, in the midst of his grief, he turned to painting, a solace that would become his raison d'être.\n\nRousseau's quest for recognition, his yearning to be acknowledged by the art world he so revered, is a poignant testament to the human condition. A self-taught painter, a neophyte in the ways of art, he toiled in the shadows of his contemporaries, men like Matisse, who danced on the periphery of the avant-garde. Yet, it was Rousseau's very uniqueness that would become his undoing, a peculiarity that would set him apart from the art world he so desperately sought to join. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed in Modern French Painters, Rousseau's canvas was a reflection of his own contradictions, a synthesis of the conventional and the unconventional, a struggle to balance the need for acceptance with the desire for artistic freedom. And so, in The Dream, we find a painter's lament, a cri de coeur that echoes through the ages, a testament to the eternal conflict between the artist's heart and the world's expectations.",
            "In the depths of human understanding, a thread of connection weaves itself between the realms of ethics and aesthetics, binding truth and beauty in an unyielding knot. It is a notion that has long been posited by the weighty minds of thinkers past, a notion that holds fast in the oft-quoted words of John Keats: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" For in the uncharted territories of existence, we arrive at truths and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us not through the channels of education or experience, but through an untaught, primal sense that defies prescription.\n\nThe study of morality and beauty is a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task to grasp the ungraspable. We toil to explain, to describe, to dissect the essence of what is beautiful or moral, yet in the end, it is a description that falls short. A discourse on the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa may center on the minutiae of foreground and background, contrast and cultural context, but these are but feeble attempts to grasp the elusive. For when asked about a beloved work of art or literature, a phrase oft precedes the more elaborate explanation: \"There's just something about it.\" And it is this \"something,\" this transcendent quality that cannot be captured, that is the very essence of both art and morality.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's words ring true: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" So too with ethics. The properties of a work of literature may be exhaustively described, but a transcendent quality remains, an unspoken truth that defies articulation. And it is this very property that binds ethics and aesthetics in an unbreakable link.\n\nWe experience both art and morality at a level that lies beyond the pale of reason, a noumenal realm that cannot be fully grasped. It is a connection that is uniquely strong in the realm of literature, where the moral quality is inescapable. As McKean so aptly puts it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" For in the words that we read, we find the values that shape our very existence. Living is a value-laden endeavor, and literature serves as a reflection of this fundamental truth.",
            "In the shadows of the Alps, where the mist-shrouded peaks plunge into the darkness, and on the unforgiving shores of the Baltic, the Germany of today stirs like a restless beast. A land of contrasts, where the medieval spires of München pierce the sky like skeletal fingers, and the Elbe River flows like a lifeblood through the ravaged heart of Dresden. It is a culture forged in the crucible of history, a patchwork of traditions stitched together from the disparate threads of a countless past. \n\nThe name \"Germania\" - a term shrouded in mystery - is a testament to the land's enigmatic origins. Some claim it owes its birth to the Tungrians, a benighted tribe that once roamed the banks of the Rhine. Others whisper that it was Julius Caesar who first penned the word \"Germanus\", a label he applied to the tribes he encountered beyond the Rhine, a people he deemed worthy of distinction from the Gauls he had subjugated. The Roman historian Tacitus, in his treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", wrote of a people untainted by intermarriage, a \"aboriginal\" stock that clung to their rugged terrain like a stubborn curse.\n\nThe land itself seemed inhospitable, a \"wild country\" where the skies raged with a ferocity that drove men to the edge of madness. Who, indeed, would trade the warmth of Asia or Africa for this unforgiving realm, where the winds howled like a chorus of the damned? And yet, the Germans persisted, their culture a litany of resilience in the face of an unyielding landscape. They forged their own path, trading their wares and their skills to the Romans, who saw fit to conquer their lands but not to stay. The Germanic tribes remained on the periphery, a thorn in the side of the Empire, a constant reminder that the forces of nature and the fury of the unknown would not be silenced.\n\nAs the centuries passed, the Germanic tribes began to assert their presence, their presence a testament to the indomitable will that coursed through their veins. They left their mark on the land, a testament to their unyielding spirit, a spirit that would one day shape the course of history in ways both grand and terrible.",
            "My gaze descended, a void in my mind where thought and comprehension converged, a blank slate upon which the world's image was inscribed.  It was a sight both mundane and wondrous, a bowl of fruit upon a table, its presence a testament to the banality of existence.  Yet, I felt no emotion, no spark of connection to this thing before me, only a detached, studied awareness that refused to yield to the ephemeral whispers of the mind.  My thoughts fluttered and died, like birds taking flight only to be snuffed out by the weight of the present moment.\n\nIn a distant past, a wise artist had counseled me to seek out a text, a guide to the mysteries of the creative process.  The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain was its name, and within its pages, I had discovered the secrets of perception, the hidden paths by which the brain unravels the tangled threads of reality.  Among its teachings was a technique, a simple yet profound exercise in discipline: to frame the subject, to reduce the chaos of the world to a manageable whole.  But on this day, as I stood before the bowl, I was unable to conjure this frame, to impose order upon the turmoil of my own mind.\n\nThe artists of old had known this struggle, had wrestled with the void and emerged with their visions.  Picasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of color – each had found their own path, their own voice.  And I, a humble aspirant, stood before the threshold of my own creation, Work in Brown.  My hand, a tool poised to bring forth beauty, shook with anticipation, the tension coiling within me like a spring.\n\nMy fingers brushed against the pencil, the muscles tensed and relaxed, as if awakening from a dream.  The water, a mirror's calm reflection, seemed to ripple and shudder, as if the very fabric of reality trembled at the prospect of creation.  And then, with a jolt, my hand struck the toilet handle, a mocking echo of the brushstrokes that might have brought forth a masterpiece.  The offending bundle, a brown, shapeless mass, refused to yield, stuck fast as a fly on a summer's day.\n\nThe mop, a makeshift staff, hung limply in my hand, as I stood before the unyielding mess, my green tie a garish wound around my throat.  The air was heavy with the stench of decay, a memento mori that mocked my aspirations.  The toilet, a portal to the abyss, seemed to gape at me, a void that swallowed all in its path.  My hand, a supplicant, rose to the sheet of toilet paper, wrapping itself in a futile attempt to grasp the ungraspable.  And then, with a slow, deliberate movement, I plunged my hand into the depths, a supplicant dipping into the unknown, a seeker of the holy grail of creation.",
            "In the desolate landscape of American roads, a specter haunts the streets, its presence as inescapable as the darkness of the night. Teenagers, with their lives as fragile as the morning dew, succumb to the cruel hand of fate, their bodies broken and still on the cold, hard asphalt. The National Institutes of Health whisper a terrible truth: the adolescent brain, still a malleable and impressionable thing, is woefully unprepared for the unforgiving hazards of driving. And so they falter, these young drivers, their inexperience a deadly weight that presses down upon them like a physical force, crushing them beneath its unyielding grip.\n\nTheir companions, too, contribute to the carnage, a motley crew of peers who ride shotgun, their presence a siren's call to recklessness. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center lays bare the correlation: the younger the passenger, the more traffic accidents that ensue. It is a cruel arithmetic, one that spells out the terrible truth in stark, unyielding terms.\n\nIn response, California and other states have resorted to provisional licenses, a palliative measure that only serves to stave off the inevitable. These temporary permits, designed to limit the hours of driving and exclude minors as passengers, are little more than a Band-Aid on a festering wound. The problem, as psychologist Marvin Zuckerman so astutely observes, lies deeper: the adolescent brain is hardwired to crave the thrill of the unknown, to court danger for the sheer exhilaration it brings. And so, we continue to issue driver's licenses to those too young to handle the risks, condemning them to a fate as predetermined as the rising sun.\n\nThe statistics scream out in horror, a chorus of death and destruction that threatens to crescendo into a maelstrom of carnage. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' progeny will flood the roads, a tidal wave of teen drivers poised to unleash a bloodbath of unprecedented proportions. The time for half-measures is over; the time for action is now.\n\nLegislation, though seemingly a simple matter, would in fact be a lifeline cast into the darkness, a beacon of hope in a sea of despair. Schools could continue to teach the basics of driving, but no one under the age of 18 should be permitted to wield the keys. A provisional permit could still be granted, but only after a rigorous course of study and a minimum number of supervised driving hours – the exact number, say, of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult, a standard already observed in many states.\n\nUniform, national legislation would be the only way to stem the tide of this national scourge, to protect the young from themselves and the unforgiving roads that await them. It is a measure that has been proposed before, but its urgency cannot be overstated. The lives of American teenagers hang in the balance, suspended like a pendulum between life and death. The clock ticks on, each passing moment a countdown to disaster. The time for action is now.",
            "I was drawn to the musty aisles of the Library of Congress's repository of Edison's early films, a collection that seemed to hold the whispers of a bygone era. My gaze settled on the trick films, fifteen in number, spanning from 1895 to 1901. These enigmatic works relied on the art of editing to conjure illusions that danced across the screen. As I delved into the poetics of these trick films, I found myself tracing the evolutionary threads that connected them, separating the outliers from the pack.\n\nIn those early days of cinema, the trick film was a creature bound to the stage, confined within a frontal proscenium, its movements restricted by the strictures of a single, static shot. The camera stood still, a sentinel, as the world unfolded before it. Long shots and medium shots were the norm, with close-ups a rarity, a luxury the camera could not afford. This was a cinema born of the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience was privy to the entire performance, a panorama framed by the borders of the stage.\n\nBut there were those who dared to challenge the conventions, to break free from the shackles of the one-shot, one-film methodology. In the early years of the twentieth century, a few films began to push the boundaries, incorporating multiple shots, fragmenting the narrative, and shattering the illusion. The trick films, however, remained steadfast in their adherence to the stage, their figures moving in a stilted, two-dimensional world, unable to break free from the confines of the frame.\n\nTake, for example, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors entered from the right, their movements restricted to a horizontal axis, never venturing forth or back, as if held captive by the very fabric of the screen. And even as they vanished from view, the camera stood firm, unmoving, a witness to the illusion.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also imposed its will on the length of the shots, favoring long, sweeping vistas, and the occasional medium shot. Close-ups were anathema, a rarity that seemed to defy the very essence of the medium. This was a cinema that drew from the wellspring of the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience beheld the entirety of the performance, unencumbered by the intimacy of the close-up.\n\nMost trick films conformed to the pattern of one conceptual shot, one film, a limitation that shackled the narrative to the brief, the ephemeral. Their stories, like the tricks themselves, were short, fleeting, and inconsequential, mere diversions from the mundane. But, as I discovered, the line between the physical and the conceptual was blurred, a single \"shot\" often comprising multiple, joined frames, a magician's sleight of hand that conjured the illusion of apparition or disappearance. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), I found myself peering behind the veil, tracing the moment where the physical shot gave way to the illusion, a single, seamless gesture that left the viewer gasping in wonder.",
            "In the somber vista of American politics, a singular figure emerged, one whose unwavering dedication to the creed of Republicanism would leave an indelible mark on the nascent nation. John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the land, with calloused hands and a steadfast resolve, coupled his agrarian pursuits with a brief foray into the realm of politics, forging a reputation as a champion of unyielding conviction and unrelenting passion for the unfettered exercise of personal freedom and government restraint. The bedrock of his convictions, the agrarian system, served as the lodestar guiding his opinions on the very fabric of governance, sovereignty, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor's vision for the United States was one of an ideal system, unencumbered by the weight of native tradition, allowing for the unfettered creation of a self-governing entity. He ardently believed in the inherent rights of man, inalienable and intertwined, such that the denial of one would precipitate the downfall of all, rendering the remaining void of value. These rights, he posited, must remain beyond the reach of government's grasping hand. In the state of nature, it was the strong and the cunning who reaped the benefits, but in a civilization, such a reality must be rebuked.\n\nTo craft this ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that accounted for the dual nature of humanity: the inherent good and evil that resided within. His rigid adherence to a dualistic morality led him to proclaim that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" The distinction, he believed, lay in the principles that governed: those that safeguarded private property, nourished agriculture, and checked the excesses of capitalism. A government founded on such principles would function in equilibrium, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be guided by the twin scourges of avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he noted, was the driving force behind human endeavor, but it was only when it led to the subjugation of one by another that it became an evil to be reckoned with. A good government, he argued, was necessary to contain this latent evil, and to ensure it did not give rise to new, malignant principles.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, championed a strict construction of the Constitution, seeking a federal government of limited scope, with powers proscribed by the explicit language of the document. The dangers of an overreaching federal authority, he believed, lay in its profligacy and the specter of despotism that accompanied it. Yet, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation, which, devoid of context, could easily become pernicious. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, served as the true charter of the United States, its words more eloquently articulating the country as a confederation of sovereign states, rather than a unified nation.",
            "In the third month of our endeavor, a precipitous decline in commuter log submissions presented itself, a disheartening turn of events that defied easy explanation. The winter's chill had begun to set in, casting a pall over the campus, and it was likely that the fewer numbers of cyclists and pedestrians that traversed the frozen landscape contributed to the downturn. The end of the fall semester brought with it a season of feverish activity, as students scrambled to complete their coursework and instructors rushed to grade their papers, their minds preoccupied with the coming winter's darkness. The log, once a steadfast companion to their daily routines, now slipped from their minds like a forgotten thing. And then, of course, there was the holiday season, a time of revelry and distraction that drove many to abandon the campus altogether, their log submissions falling by the wayside.\n\nBut even after the semester's resumption in late January, when the campus stirred once more, the numbers remained low, a mystery that refused to yield its secrets. Some might say that projects of this sort are wont to follow a natural arc, a burst of energy at their inception followed by a gradual decline. We might have been doomed to follow this trajectory, our efforts to buck the trend ultimately in vain. Yet we sought to counter this trend, to rekindle the flame of enthusiasm that had once burned so brightly. And so we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a campaign of sorts to revive the project's flagging fortunes. And to our surprise, it worked, the numbers swelling in March as the challenge took hold.\n\nBut the challenges we faced ran deeper than mere seasonal fluctuations or the natural ebb and flow of a project's popularity. At its core, the project was hampered by the entrenched habits of a people, their love of independence and the freedom that came with driving their own vehicles. It was a deeply ingrained habit, one that our efforts to supplant with alternative modes of transportation were likely to struggle against. And so we resorted to offering incentives, prizes of a sort to tempt them from their cars and onto the buses and trains. We gave out gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, hoping to entice them with the promise of a free meal or a warm cup of coffee. But one cannot help but wonder what might have been achieved had we offered something more substantial, something that spoke to the very heart of our car-addled culture: a bicycle, a hybrid car, or perhaps an electric vehicle, its sleek lines and whirring motor a beacon to those who sought a different way.\n\nIf only we had known what the outcome would be, we might have offered such prizes in the depths of winter, when the project's fortunes seemed at their lowest ebb. Perhaps, then, the numbers would have swelled, and our project would have gained the momentum it so sorely needed. But as it was, we were left to ponder what might have been, our efforts to rekindle the project's flame reduced to naught but a faint glow in the darkness.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of the financial markets, a peculiar creature roams, known as the Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF.  A security both akin to an index fund and a stock, but with the flexibility to adapt and change as the wind whispers through the trees.  It offers the diversification of a broad index, the benefits of single stock ownership, and the freedom to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase a single share in the blink of an eye.  The allure of such a creature is undeniable, yet it is a siren's call that beckons with a price.  For in the depths of the ETF's promise lies a cost, a commission that must be paid with each transaction, a toll exacted by the market's unforgiving hand.\n\nAnd yet, the ETF's benefits are legion, a veritable cornucopia of advantages that beckon the savvy investor to partake.  The variety of funds available is staggering, a tapestry woven from countless threads, each one a distinct pattern of investment.  But, as the wise investor knows, benefits must be weighed against costs, and the value of diversification, like a mirage on a desert highway, must be carefully evaluated.  For the purposes of this exercise, we shall examine the ETF IHF, a creature of the market, and compare it to the top 10 holdings that comprise its very being.  We shall seek to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks that comprise it, and whether there are other configurations of these same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\nTo gain a glimpse into the ETF's inner workings, we shall focus on the top 10 holdings, those that account for 63.58% of its total assets.  These are the titans that shape the ETF's character, its very essence.  Below, we shall present the top 10 holdings, their percentage of total assets, a stark reminder of their influence.\n\nTo assess the validity of our findings, we shall use a statistical tool, a means of estimation that seeks to quantify the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return.  The calculations shall be presented in a chart, a visual representation of the data, a map of the ETF's terrain.  From this chart, it is evident that a portfolio composed of the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF as a whole, a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF, a testament to its reduced volatility.\n\nBut, like the desert wind, our findings may be nothing more than a mirage.  To determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, a measure of their volatility.  We shall normalize these values to 100%, a means of comparison, a yardstick to measure the accumulated risk of each portfolio.  The results of this exercise shall reveal whether the portfolios are, in truth, distinct, or merely a product of chance, a fleeting illusion in the vast expanse of the market.",
            "The melancholy shores of Dream-Land, a poem born of Edgar Allan Poe's troubled soul, stands as a testament to his affinity for the dark recesses of the human experience. In his lamentable verse, the name \"Thulé\" echoes through the lines like a mournful sigh, a whispered reminder of a world beyond the reaches of mortal comprehension. The erudite Mabbott notes the origin of this term in the venerable Virgil, whose words spoke of an island shrouded in mystery, a place where the Greeks believed the known world gave way to an abyss of unknown terrors. Yet, it is in the realm of German literature that we find the true source of Poe's fascination with Thulé.\n\nA shadowy figure looms in the background, a giant of letters whose influence cast a long and sinister shadow over the literary landscape of the 19th century: Goethe. Poe's esteem for the German master is palpable, a respect that borders on reverence. Karl J. Arndt's piercing insight into the parallels between Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon reveals a poet consumed by the echoes of his predecessor's work, a haunted echo that refuses to be silenced.\n\nIn Goethe's Faust, a masterpiece of poetic drama, we find a telltale sign of the Thulé's presence. The second part of this sprawling epic, penned in the final year of Goethe's life, holds a small but significant gem: \"The King of Thulé\", a haunting tale of a monarch undone by the loss of his beloved wife. His grief is a consuming force, a maelstrom that threatens to engulf him whole, driving him to the brink of madness and despair. His descent into the abyss is a cautionary tale of the destructive power of love and loss.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are too striking to be mere coincidence. Both works speak to the same dark and forsaken landscape, a world where the colors have been drained from the palette of existence, leaving only shades of grey and the haunting specter of mortality. Poe's use of the term \"ultma Thule\" in The Pit and the Pendulum, a phrase that echoes the King's lament in Goethe's poem, serves as a reminder that the boundaries between reality and nightmare are perilously thin.\n\nIn the shadowy realm of Dream-Land, the speaker wanders, lost and forlorn, haunted by the ghosts of dead friends and the desolate landscape of a world without color or hope. It is a world that speaks to the very heart of Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\", a world where the lines between reality and madness are blurred, and the only solace is the cold comfort of death.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is a matter of record, a fact confirmed by the poet's own words, spoken with reverence and awe. His admiration for Tennyson, a poet who owed a debt to Goethe's own mastery, served as a bridge between the two literary worlds, a testament to the far-reaching influence of the German master. And so, we find ourselves drawn into the dark and foreboding world of Dream-Land, a world that echoes the haunted landscapes of Goethe's imagination, a world where the shadows loom large, and the light of hope is but a distant memory.",
            "The sun beat down upon the asphalt expanse of the parking lot as Jennifer Palmer made her way into the sterile confines of D&D Markets, her footsteps echoing off the fluorescent lights that cast an unforgiving glare upon the aisles. It was a moment of carelessness that would change her life forever, a moment that would leave her writhing in agony, her back shattered by the cruel hand of fate. A spill, a seemingly insignificant splatter of applesauce upon the floor, lay in wait, a trap set by the very people who were supposed to protect her.\n\nThe store manager, Paul Martin, had been warned twice of the danger, twice informed of the spill's presence, and yet he chose to ignore it, to turn a blind eye to the probable harm that would befall those who walked upon that floor. His excuse, a paltry one, a feeble attempt to shift the blame: he was eating dinner, and thus could not be bothered to attend to the matter at hand. The minutes ticked by, a half-hour of inaction, a half-hour of willful disregard for the safety of those who entered his store.\n\nSix slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the months prior to Palmer's accident, a litany of warnings that went unheeded, a testament to the store's cavalier attitude towards the well-being of its customers. And yet, Martin continued to fail to act, to show a callous disregard for the rights and safety of those who walked through his doors. His actions, those of a man who had abandoned all sense of responsibility, all sense of duty.\n\nThe question before us is this: can a customer who has been so callously disregarded, so callously injured, be awarded punitive damages? Can the court justify such a punishment, one that seeks to right the wrongs of the past, to hold accountable those who have acted with such malice? The answer, we are told, lies in the law, in the statutes that govern such cases. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract, if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" And what is malice, you ask? Is it not the conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, a willful and deliberate failure to act when the consequences of inaction are clear? The courts have spoken on this matter, and their words are clear: conduct is malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, when the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions, and yet willfully and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.\n\nThe facts of this case are stark, a tale of negligence and malice, of a store that has shown a callous disregard for the safety of its customers. The question now is, what will be the consequence of such actions? Will the courts see fit to award punitive damages, to punish those who have acted with such malice? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the people of this state demand justice, and it is the duty of the courts to see that it is served.",
            "Four winters ago, I wandered into a class on the tenets of Islam at the CBC, and it was there that the seeds of discord were sown.  A question hung heavy in the air, one that still festers to this day: is Islam a creed of hostility?  I had thought it a query of little consequence, but the more I delved into the subject, the more I came to realize its relevance.  The passage of time, marked by the smoldering embers of 9/11, has seen a transformation in the gaze of the media.  What was once a hostile scrutiny has given way to an almost reverent tolerance, an unyielding acceptance that borders on complicity.  And so, in this altered landscape, a man with a name that echoes the distant shores of the Old World can rise to the highest office in the land, a man whose familial ties to Islam are as plain as the nose on his face.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad holds a peculiar fascination for me, a paradoxical tome that defies the expectations I had formed of its subject.  According to the chronicle, Muhammad was a man of humility, a martyr misunderstood by his contemporaries, who humbled himself before them, and yet, it was this very humility that drew people to him, one by one, like moths to a flame.  This portrayal stands in stark contrast to the image I had conjured of a man who would not hesitate to wield power, who would conquer and subjugate, forcing his will upon the tribes he vanquished, compelling them to submit to his creed.\n\nAnd then, there are the echoes of a familiar narrative, a tale of miracles and wondrous deeds that recall the Gospels.  The story of the multiplication of bread and cheese, a feat that would have fed forty men, is a case in point.  This kind of writing, I suspect, is a deliberate attempt to cast Muhammad in a certain light, to portray him as a prophet who did not need to prove himself, but rather lived in a state of effortless truth and miracle.  This, to my mind, is a pitfall, a fallacy that diminishes the very real and profound life of Jesus Christ, who was not a figure to be emulated or co-opted, but revered in his own right.\n\nThe biography is replete with accounts of conversions, of people coming to Muhammad on their own, uncoerced and unforced.  But these stories, I found, are often third-hand, filtered through the lens of intermediaries, their veracity tenuous at best.  This, to me, only serves to sully the narrative, to render it suspect and open to interpretation.\n\nWhat troubles me most, however, is the way the biography seeks to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal, to portray him as a paragon of virtue, a godly man of humility and wisdom.  But history, that great leveler, tells a different tale, one of a man who rose to power through a complex web of alliances and conquests.  And I am left to wonder, do the adherents of Islam today know the true story of their Prophet's ascension to greatness?",
            "In the sullen aftermath of Christ's departure, the tenets of his teachings were left to wither like autumn leaves, cast aside by the relentless tide of Christian thought that surged forward, heedless of its source.  The passage of time revealed a trajectory of aberration, a meandering path that led further and further from the original intent.  Yet, in the gathering twilight of the world, a growing awareness stirs, a yearning to unshackle the faith from the accumulated weight of doctrine, to strip away the accretions that had been layered upon its core.  It may be a slow and arduous process, one that will take generations, perhaps centuries, to unfold.  But the end will be inescapable: a great reversal, a return to the primordial form, a stripping away of the extraneous, until naught remains but the essence of Christ's message, unadulterated and unencumbered by the claims of later interpreters.\n\nThe clock, it seems, will be turned backward, its hands unwinding as the church, that bastion of tradition, leads the faithful on a journey of rediscovery.  The diverse and disparate branches of Christendom, once a tapestry woven from the threads of countless interpretations, will begin to reveal their shared tapestry, a rich and vibrant fabric of unity.  It is a process that has played out before, in the grand tapestry of human history.  We see it in the rise of Christianity from the ashes of Roman oppression, in the transformation of a nation founded on the shackles of slavery to one that proudly proclaims the leadership of its African-American sons and daughters.\n\nAnd yet, it is a path fraught with peril, for it demands a willingness to read the words of Christ not as literal truths, but as metaphors that speak to the human condition.  It is a reading that requires a certain kind of courage, a willingness to strip away the veil of dogma and confront the raw power of the human experience.  For in the end, it is not the specifics of doctrine that matter, but the essence of the message itself, that great and abiding truth that has been at the heart of faith since the dawn of time.\n\nLooking back, we find the beginnings of this great narrative in the ancient soil of Judaism, that rich and fertile ground from which Christianity sprouted.  There, in the crucible of monotheism, the Hebrew scriptures, and the authority of the divine, we find the seeds of a faith that would one day spread far and wide.  But even in those early days, the Jewish people were not a monolithic entity, rather a tapestry of disparate threads, each with its own unique voice and perspective: the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the countless others who made up the body of the faith.  It is a testament to the enduring power of human spirit, a spirit that would one day give rise to a faith that would change the course of history.  And it is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of transformation, always the chance for a new dawn to break, and for the human heart to be renewed.",
            "In the darkest recesses of the human heart, a malignancy festers. A cancer of self-interest that gnaws at the very marrow of our existence. The Jungle lays bare this depravity, a stark and unflinching expose of a people consumed by their own avarice. They toil, these men and women, driven by a singular desire to eke out a meager existence, to scrape together a existence of fleeting comfort and security. And yet, in their fervor, they trample all that lies in their path, heedless of the ruin they leave in their wake.\n\nThe titans of industry, those grasping masters of the great factories, are the embodiment of this rapacious hunger. Theirs is an insatiable drive for power and wealth, a lust that knows no bounds. They care not a whit for the lives they crush beneath their heel, nor the earth they sully with their pollution. As Sinclair's words evoke the image of the factories, a bleak and foreboding silhouette against the sky, the very air thick with the noxious fumes of their machinations. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A dire litany of neglect and abandon, a testament to the desolate toll of their progress.\n\nTheir concern for their employees is but a distant abstraction, a hollow sham. \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They wield their power with an iron fist, crushing all who dare oppose them. The workingmen toil in a living hell of long hours and squalid conditions, their sweat and blood the lifeblood of the factories. And when they falter, when their bodies break beneath the weight of their labor, they are cast aside like so much trash, discarded without a second thought.\n\nIn that era, a time of unbridled greed and unchecked power, the workers were but pawns in a game they did not understand. No shield of law protected them from the whims of their masters, no safety net to catch their fall. The unions, formed in a desperate bid for solidarity, often proved a mirage, a cruel mockery of the workers' hopes. And so they toiled, these wretched souls, their lives a struggle to survive in a world that seemed determined to crush them. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" A bleak and unvarnished truth, a testament to the darkness that lies at the heart of human nature.",
            "The canvas of meaning is painted with the strokes of words, a tapestry woven from the threads of association and suggestion. F. Scott Fitzgerald, a master of this craft, employs a multitude of techniques to conjure the essence of his subjects. His novel, The Great Gatsby, is a testament to his skill, as he coaxes the reader into a world of subtle nuance and rich connotation.\n\nFitzgerald's palette is vast, yet he chooses to drench his narrative in the hues of gold, green, white, and gray. These colors, initially blank canvases, are imbued with meaning, only to be summoned later to reinforce the significance of crucial objects. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald invests the dichotomy of white and gray with particular import, whispering to the reader the secrets of class and age.\n\nIn the opening pages, the reader is presented with a tableau of whiteness, a sea of purity and refinement. Daisy and Jordan, titans of elegance, move through the narrative swathed in white, their very being an affirmation of the color's association with aristocracy. Even the narrator, Nick Carraway, is not immune to the allure of white, donning \"white flannels\" to attend Gatsby's grand fete. Conversely, Tom, the symbol of solidity and tradition, sports a \"white shirt\" at his encounter with Myrtle, underscoring the color's connection to class and status.\n\nHowever, it is not merely the presence of white that defines its significance. Fitzgerald also employs its absence to create a sense of contrast. As Nick navigates the city, he traverses \"white chasms\" of lower New York, the city's underbelly laid bare. The names of the guests at Gatsby's parties are relegated to a \"gray list,\" their importance diminished by the passage of time. Even the landscape itself is drained of vibrancy, reduced to a \"gray land\" of ashes.\n\nIt is in these moments of subtlety that Fitzgerald's mastery of suggestion is revealed. He coaxes the reader into a world of inference, where meaning is drawn from the shadows. And it is this very subtlety that allows him to strip away the facade of Daisy, reducing her to a mere \"white\" object of desire, a mere addition to Gatsby's ever-growing collection of possessions. The \"gray haze\" of her fur collar, the \"white\" dress she wears before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby – each is a deliberate choice, a thread in the tapestry of meaning that Fitzgerald has so skillfully woven.\n\nIn the end, it is not the explicit statement that reveals the depth of Fitzgerald's craft, but the whispered suggestion, the hint of meaning that lingers in the shadows, waiting to be uncovered by the attentive reader.",
            "The land, a patchwork quilt of chaparral, non-native grasses, and oak woodland, sprawls across the arid expanse like a worn and weathered skin. San Diego County's temperate climate, a gentle benediction of sunshine and moderate rainfall, has rendered this tract a verdant oasis, a fertile cradle for the earthy fruits of labor. Tomatoes, citrus, and leafy greens burst forth from the earth, their verdant shoots a testament to the land's unfettered potential. Peaches and lemons, tree fruits that cling to the branch like the last wisps of dawn's mist, hang heavy with promise. Berries, a tangled skein of sweetness, and peppers, their fiery essence a spark of life, complete the tapestry of this agricultural tapestry. The locals, a throng of devotees to the organic cause, clamor for the taste of this land's bounty, their demand a siren's call that echoes through the hills.\n\nA niche market, a hidden cleft in the market's jagged edge, beckons to the enterprising farmer. The calls for organic, community-supported agriculture resound through the land, a rallying cry that summons the brave and the devoted. Eggs and milk, the pure and unadulterated products of this earth, fetch a premium price, their value a testament to the riches that lie within. And yet, the farmer must navigate the treacherous shoals of cost and profit, a delicate balance that shifts like the sands in an hourglass. The land, a canvas of untold potential, demands a stewardship that is both fierce and gentle, a dance between the competing demands of profit and preservation.\n\nThe land itself, a storied and ancient presence, whispers secrets to those who would listen. For centuries, it has borne witness to the ebb and flow of human endeavor, a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before. Native Americans, their footprints erased by time, left their mark upon this land, a legacy of tradition and lore. Cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers, their names etched upon the pages of history, followed in their footsteps, their presence a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of time.\n\nThis, then, is the land, a canvas of untold potential, a site of ancient power and modern struggle. A farmer, a steward of this earth, must navigate the shifting sands of cost and profit, ever mindful of the delicate balance between the demands of the land and the needs of the market. The government programs, a patchwork of aid and support, beckon to the farmer, a lifeline in the turbulent sea of uncertainty. And yet, the land remains, a constant presence, a reminder of the enduring power of the natural world.\n\nI chose this land, a parcel of 160 acres, situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, a complex web of species and habitat, considers over a hundred species, many of which are endangered or declining. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, their names etched upon the pages of extinction, hang in the balance, their fate a testament to the fragility of life.\n\nThis land, a piece of the original homestead patent, has borne witness to the ebb and flow of human endeavor, its history a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before. The Native Americans, their footprints erased by time, left their mark upon this land, a legacy of tradition and lore. And now, I, a seeker of knowledge, have come to this place, a site of ancient power and modern struggle, to learn from its secrets and to understand the delicate balance between the demands of the land and the needs of the market.",
            "Culture hangs in the balance like an unspoken weight, its presence as palpable as the silence between two men on a dusty road. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what it is not, as much as what it is. A culture is not a singular thing, nor a fixed entity, but a fluid, ever-shifting entity that defies easy categorization. To say that all Russians are stubborn or that all Japanese are accommodating is to oversimplify the labyrinthine complexities of the human experience. The notion that a culture can be reduced to a few fleeting generalities is a folly, a seductive lie that tempts the unwary into the quicksand of misperception.\n\nTo truly grasp the essence of a culture, one must dig deeper, into the rich soil of its history, its prejudices, its very marrow. It is not a matter of judging or seeking to change, but of accepting it for what it is, a force that shapes and is shaped by the negotiations that unfold before us. When we approach a foreign culture, we bring with us the biases of our own, the specter of our own experiences, and the comparisons that inevitably arise are a pale reflection of the reality that lies before us.\n\nTo navigate this treacherous terrain, a negotiator must be willing to listen, to observe, and to learn. He must be attuned to the subtle nuances of body language, the cadence of language, the rhythms of communication that speak to the heart of a culture. For it is not the surface-level trappings of culture that matter, but the deeper currents that shape its very fabric. The traditions, the customs, the values that underpin a culture are the keys to unlocking its essence, and it is these that a negotiator must seek to understand.\n\nAnd yet, culture is not a monolith, a singular entity that can be reduced to a few neat categories. It is a multifaceted gem, cut in a thousand different ways, reflecting the diversity of thought and experience that lies within. A company's culture, for example, may be as varied as the individuals who comprise it, reflecting the values, the attitudes, and the traditions that shape its very being. The dress code, the communication style, the hiring practices – all these and more speak to the culture that resides within, a culture that is as unique as the individuals who inhabit it.\n\nBut values, those bedrock principles that underpin a culture, are the key to unlocking its essence. They speak to the very heart of what drives a culture, the motivations that shape its actions, and the attitudes that inform its decisions. A culture that values saving face, communal harmony, or the pursuit of a hard-driven bargain will act accordingly, and it is the negotiator who understands these values, who can read the signs, who can navigate the complex web of relationships that underpin a culture, who will emerge triumphant.\n\nTo truly succeed in the art of negotiation, one must be willing to strip away the façade, to peer into the depths of a culture, and to emerge with a deeper understanding of its essence. It is a journey that requires patience, empathy, and a willingness to learn, for it is in the unknown, in the uncharted territories of the human experience, that the greatest rewards lie in wait.",
            "In the wilderness of the human heart, a desolate cry echoes forth: \"There is no God.\"  It is a refrain first inscribed in the dusty pages of Psalm 14, a testament to the unyielding skepticism that has long stalked the paths of men.  And so it is, too, with Thomas Aquinas, a voice crying out in the darkness, seeking to illuminate the shadows with the faint glow of reason.  St. Anselm, a precursor to this quest, stood before him, a beacon of faith that cast a different light upon the same desolate landscape.\n\nTo compare the arguments of these two men, we must first accept that they speak of the same God, the God of the Bible, a deity born of blood and fire, of sacrifice and redemption.  To conjure a false idol, a God of our own making, would be to betray the very purpose of their discourse.  And so, we must proceed with the understanding that their words are a testament to their shared conviction, a conviction that we shall dissect with the precision of a surgeon.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument is a labyrinth of introspection, a journey into the very depths of the human soul.  He posits that the existence of God is a truth that can be unearthed within the recesses of our own minds, a truth that cannot be diminished by the weight of empirical evidence.  It is a truth that arises from the dust of our own understanding, a spark that ignites within the darkness.  And so, he writes, we need not look beyond the boundaries of our own consciousness to find the proof of God, for it lies within the very fabric of our being.\n\nBut Thomas Aquinas has a different path to tread.  He is a man of reason, a seeker of logic and evidence.  He believes that the existence of God can be proved, not through the whispers of faith, but through the cold, unforgiving light of reason.  He marshals five arguments, a phalanx of logic that seeks to vanquish the shadows of doubt.  He speaks of change, of causation, of contingency, of degrees of excellence, and of harmony, each a stone in the edifice of his proof.  And in each, he demonstrates the inexorable logic of God's existence, a truth that cannot be denied, a truth that rises from the ashes of human understanding.",
            "In the dimly lit recesses of time, a prince emerged, his name lost to the annals of history, yet destined to bear the moniker Buddha, the Awakened One. The weight of his existence bore down upon him like a stone, a burden he would eventually cast aside, like a worn cloak. His footsteps led him down a path of renunciation, into the depths of the self, where the shadows danced with the whispers of impermanence. And there, in the stillness, he found the light, a radiance that illuminated the darkness, and his teachings gave rise to a faith that would spread like a slow-moving tide.\n\nBuddhism, a creed born of his wisdom, now stretches across the expanse of centuries, its contours worn by the touch of time. In the distant land of Sri Lanka, where the Theravada nation holds sway, the ancient rituals persist, a testament to the indomitable will of the faithful. The water-cutting ceremony, a spectacle both mystifying and beautiful, draws participants from all walks of life, a ceremony born not from the words of the Buddha, but from the fertile soil of tradition. It is a reminder that the teachings of the past, like autumn leaves, wither and fade, leaving behind the seeds of a new harvest.\n\nIn this vast and shifting landscape, where the contours of doctrine blur and shift, it is essential to grasp the fundamental principles that underpin the Theravada faith. The triple gem, a trio of sacred pillars, stands steadfast against the tempests of time: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a vast and labyrinthine tapestry, weaves together the threads of the Tripitaka, three baskets of scripture that hold the secrets of the cosmos. The Sutta Pitaka, a repository of the Buddha's words, contains the Suttas, vessels of wisdom; the Vinaya Pitaka, a code of conduct, outlines the rules that govern the lives of the faithful; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, a realm of metaphysical mysteries, whispers secrets of the universe, of the fleeting nature of existence, and the illusion of the self.\n\nIn this realm of shadows and light, the concepts of Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca hold sway, their presence a reminder of the impermanence that shapes all things. It is only by recognizing these truths that one may escape the cycle of Sansara, the Samsaric wheel, where desire, hatred, and delusion bind us, like chains to a forgotten past. The Vinaya Pitaka, a code of conduct, outlines the rules that govern the lives of the faithful, a path of moderation and restraint, a balance between the extremes of indulgence and asceticism. For the layman, five precepts serve as a beacon, guiding him along the path of righteousness: to refrain from taking life, from falsehood, from thievery, from licentiousness, and from intoxication. For the monk, a more stringent code, a set of disciplines, serves as a reminder of the gravity of his commitment.\n\nAnd at the very heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths, a quartet of declarations that illuminate the human condition: that life is suffering, that attachment is the source of suffering, that suffering can be overcome, and that the path to liberation lies in the recognition of these truths.",
            "The ravages of time have witnessed a protracted and unyielding enmity between the United States and Mexico, a conflict that scorched the landscape for a span of 57 years, from the ravaged year of 1836 to the dying embers of 1893. The tempests of war, most notably the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, had left an indelible mark upon the soil, as the victor claimed dominion over the newly acquired territories of Texas and the American Southwest. The tumultuous relations between the two nations had been forged in the crucible of conflicting interests, a maelstrom of clashing values and traditions that would not abate until the First World War brought a measure of respite.\n\nThis was no isolated phenomenon, for border nations oft find themselves beset by the same trials, their interests and values pulling them apart like a tectonic fault line. The United States and Mexico, like a pair of weathered adversaries, had been locked in a perpetual struggle, their differences in creed and culture a chasm that seemed insurmountable. As David M. Pletcher observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, intractable American diplomatic problems\" (1977, p. 41), a testament to the enduring nature of their animosity.\n\nThe discord between the two nations was not solely the result of ideological differences, but rather the weight of their colonial past, a legacy of distrust and animosity bequeathed by the English and Spanish. The United States, with its Protestant heritage, had long been wary of the Catholicism that dominated the Mexican heartland, a divide that would prove as insurmountable as the Rio Grande. As Sally Frahm noted, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (2001, p. 86), a litany of grievances that would fuel the fires of their animosity.\n\nThe long and winding road to reconciliation was fraught with peril, as the two nations clashed over territorial disputes, border raids, and the lawless expanse of the frontier. Diehl and Goerts (2000) chronicled 17 such disputes, a litany of conflicts that would have been insurmountable were it not for the shifting tides of power and the changing ambitions of the United States. As Schmitt (1974) astutely observed, it was only when Mexico became \"clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" that the rivalry began to abate, its final embers extinguished as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the latter half of the 19th century.",
            "It has been fifteen years since the darkness crept in, a stealthy thief that stole my vitality and left me a shadow of my former self. I was a nurse, a profession born of necessity, a desperate bid to escape the poverty and uncertainty that had long defined my existence. The mantra that echoed through my adolescence, a cold comfort, had been: \"You'll always find work; people will always fall ill.\" And so I chose the path of service, a compromise that would allow me to eke out a living, to scrape by in a world that seemed determined to crush me.\n\nNow, at 46, I am a relic, a spent thing, my bank accounts depleted, my future as uncertain as the wind. Fifteen years of living on the charity of the state have stripped me bare, leaving me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a relentless assault on my very being, a reminder that security, safety, and self-respect are fleeting illusions. And yet, in this desolate landscape, one truth remains: it was the kindness of strangers, the love of family and friends, that sustained me, that allowed me to cling to life.\n\nFor in the face of disaster, be it great or small, we are not strong enough to stand alone. We are fragile, vulnerable, and broken. And so, in this cold, unforgiving world, I implore you: do not place your faith in the empty promises of those who would have you believe that you are sufficient, that you are self-sufficient. Learn to trust in the goodness of others, to ask for help, to offer help. For it was not rugged individualism that carried our forebears across the wilderness, but compassion, respect, and a willingness to share what little they had.\n\nThe Conservatives would have us believe that it was the rugged individualist who built this nation, who carved out a home in the unforgiving vastness. But I know better. I know that it was the shared burdens, the collective struggles, the kindness of strangers that saw us through the darkest of times.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. Store your food and water, stockpile your supplies, and board up your windows. But do not forget the most essential tool of all: the willingness to ask for help, to offer help, to be a neighbor to those around you. For in the end, it is not the preparedness that will see us through, but the human connections that bind us together.",
            "[The darkness that shrouds the labyrinthine paths of evolution.  We seek to unravel the mysteries that govern the trajectory of life, to discern the guiding principles that dictate the course of change.  For even the most skilled of zoologists, the task of defining the organic forms that inhabit our world remains a Sisyphean endeavor, a quest that has been undertaken by few and accomplished by none.  The words of D'Arcy Thompson, spoken in 1917, still echo through the chambers of time: \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\"  And yet, we press on, driven by the faint glimmer of understanding that may be gleaned from the austere beauty of mathematical models.\n\nIn our study, we have set our sights on the humble mollusk, Prunum, and sought to apply the cold, unforgiving logic of mathematical modeling to the study of its skeletogenesis.  Through the application of X-radiographic images and the aid of the software program CerioShell, we have endeavored to quantify the parameters that govern the development of this creature's shell.  Like a topographer charting the unmapped terrain of a foreign land, we have sought to delineate the contours of possible morphological change, to chart the course of evolution through the dark and unforgiving expanse of time.\n\nThe shell, that most wondrous of structures, can be seen as a tube that travels through the 360 degrees of space, a spiral that unwinds through the ages.  The whorls, those successive coils that comprise the shell, are but a testament to the ceaseless drive of the mollusk's growth, a spiral that spirals outward from the central axis, the columella.  And the sutures, those thin lines that separate each whorl, they mark the passage of time, the slow and incremental accumulation of growth.\n\nBut what of the shell's geometry, that most abstract of concepts?  Can we quantify the shape, the form, the very essence of this most wondrous of structures?  Can we chart the trajectory of the aperture, that narrow opening through which the mollusk extends its vulnerable form into the world?  And what of the whorls themselves, those successive coils that comprise the shell?  Can we count them, measure them, and thereby unlock the secrets of the mollusk's development?\n\nWe have sought to answer these questions, to quantify the shape of the shell, to chart the trajectory of the aperture, and to count the whorls.  And in so doing, we have discovered a world of mathematical beauty, a world of abstract forms and geometric shapes.  Like a cartographer charting the unmapped terrain of a foreign land, we have sought to map the contours of the shell, to chart the course of evolution through the dark and unforgiving expanse of time.\n\nOur method, a simple one, yet fraught with complexity.  We view the shell from the apical perspective, that most straightforward of views, and mark the beginning of the first suture.  From this line, we draw a line, and count the whorls, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.  And so, the shell is revealed in all its geometric beauty, a series of apertures that travel through time and space, a spiral that spirals outward from the central axis.\n\nThis trajectory, this path of the aperture, can be graphically and mathematically represented.  And once a mathematical formulation is made, we may vary the parameters, modify the skeletogenesis, and thus unlock the secrets of the mollusk's development.  For in the end, it is not the shell that is the goal, but the understanding that lies within, the understanding of the very essence of life itself.]",
            "The infant's fragile life slipped unnoticed into the abyss, a forgotten statistic lost in the vast expanse of Indonesia's unyielding demographic.  A decade's worth of stagnation had passed, the numbers stubbornly refusing to budge.  The country's forward march towards the Millennium Development Goals was a tale of two trajectories: one of progress, the other of stagnation.  The waters of sanitation had been brought under control, the targets met with a quiet efficiency, but the currents of child and maternal health continued to churn, unmoved by the efforts to stem their tide.  The reasons for this disconnect were many, and the need to shore up the country's health system, rather than merely patching its frayed seams with programmatic interventions, became increasingly clear.\n\nA glimmer of hope flickered in the statistics, a 72% of births attended by skilled hands, the traditional midwives a reminder that even in the most modern of times, the old ways persisted.  But these numbers, too, told a story of untold suffering, of lives lost to the unmet promise of medical intervention.  The hemorrhage that cut short so many lives a silent testament to the limits of midwifery's art.  And the numbers of children under five, their small bodies battered by the relentless onslaught of diarrheal disease, a grim reminder that the fight for their lives was far from won.\n\nThe cesarean section rates, a mere 4%, a statistic that spoke to the deep-seated inequities that ravaged the country's rural heart.  Urban and rural, two worlds apart, the latter a desolate landscape of unmet needs, the former a bastion of privilege.  The 7% in urban settings, a stark contrast to the paltry 2% in rural areas, a stark reminder of the country's failed promise to its most vulnerable citizens.  And the gap, a chasm of 27%, the poorest and richest quintiles worlds apart, their access to healthcare a luxury reserved for the few.\n\nAs the search for solutions continued, the question loomed large: how to close the yawning chasm of service, to bring the healthcare system into the 21st century?  The allure of program-specific approaches, a siren's call to targeted interventions, to cherry-picked solutions, a promise of quick fixes and rapid returns.  But at what cost?  The pitfalls of vertical approaches, the diversion of resources, the hemorrhage of funding from other areas, the siphoning off of human capital, the duplication of services, the labyrinthine paperwork, the suffocating complexity.  The example of HIV/AIDS, a cautionary tale of the unintended consequences of programmatic zeal, the family planning sector a casualty of the international community's misplaced priorities.",
            "In the shadow of the Victorian era, two novels stood apart from the grand tapestry of their brethren - Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Like specters, they loomed, their darkness a counterpoint to the gilded opulence that defined their time.  These works, born of a fevered imagination, bore the scars of a world in flux, where the boundaries between reality and madness were but a whispered secret.  In them, the author's masterful hand wove a tapestry of mystery, an intricate dance of the bizarre and the unknown.\n\nAs the protagonist, Oliver Twist, stumbled through the labyrinthine streets of London, the cacophony of his mind threatened to consume him whole.  The words of Sikes and Crackit still echoed in his ears, a maddening refrain that threatened to unravel the very fabric of his sanity.  And then, like a crack of thunder on a summer's day, the sound of firearms shattered the air, sending a chill through his very marrow.  In the depths of his mind, a maelstrom of visions swirled, a kaleidoscope of light and sound that threatened to dash him to the rocks of despair.  Through it all, a thread of pain ran, a constant heartbeat that tormented him, a reminder that in this world, he was but a fragile, helpless thing.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dream sequences - these glimpses into the abyss - served as a window into the soul of the protagonist.  They revealed the depths of his pain, the terrors that haunted him, and the crushing weight of his ignorance.  When, in chapter 28, Oliver relived the trauma of the shooting, it was as if the very fabric of time had been torn apart, revealing the raw, pulsing wound beneath.  The passage was a brutal reminder of the fragility of life, of the helplessness that lay at its core.  For in that moment, Oliver was but a leaf on the wind, blown about by the whims of fate, his senses dulled, his will shattered.  And in that darkness, the question arose: whose hand had guided him to this place of despair?  Was it his own, or some malevolent force that had seized him, guiding him down a path from which he could not escape?\n\nThe day passed - a fleeting moment, a whispered secret, lost in the shadows.  It was gone, consumed by the endless night, a night that seemed to stretch on forever, a cavernous chasm filled with the whispers of the damned.  And in that darkness, Oliver's fate was sealed, a destiny that seemed to stretch out before him like a cold, unforgiving stone.",
            "The memories of those afternoons spent amidst the sterile glow of fluorescent lights still linger, a faint haze that clings to the skin like the lingering chill of a winter's breeze. It was there, in that desolate landscape of learning, that I chanced upon the tale of Adrian, a boy shrouded in an enigma. His struggle with the written word was a riddle, one that I, with my halting grasp of the alphabet, was powerless to decipher. The letters danced before his eyes, a maddening jumble of sounds and symbols, their meaning lost to him. His English was flawless, a smooth current that flowed effortlessly from his lips, yet his reading was a jarring discord, a cacophony of sounds that defied comprehension.\n\nIt was only when his mother arrived, a woman who spoke in a language that was a foreign tongue to me, that the truth began to unravel. Like a thread pulled loose from a tapestry, the mystery of Adrian's struggles began to reveal itself. His mother's presence was a reminder that the language barrier is a chasm that runs deep, a gulf that separates the world of sound from the world of sense. And it was there, in that moment, that I realized the gravity of the problem: even for those who speak the language with ease, the act of reading can be a daunting task.\n\nThe issue is a canker that festers in the marrow of our education system, a wound that refuses to heal. The solutions, like so many bandages, offer only temporary respite from the pain. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – each one a fragmented attempt to stem the tide of linguistic confusion. And yet, like a river that flows unimpeded, the problem persists.\n\nBut what if we were to approach this issue with a different perspective? What if we were to see the dual language system not as a luxury, but as a necessity? Studies have shown that children enrolled in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers, their minds sharpened by the demands of navigating two languages. The fear of wasting resources, the fear of the unknown, is a specter that haunts our decision-makers. But it is a fear born of ignorance. For if we were to apply this approach on a grand scale, to make it the rule rather than the exception, the benefits would be felt by all.\n\nBut how do we make this a reality? Do we require our teachers to be bilingual, to walk the tightrope of two languages with ease? No, that would be an impossible task, a burden that would drive even the most dedicated educators to despair. But what if we were to provide them with the tools they need? What if we were to offer them the aid of bilingual tutors, language specialists who could bridge the gap between the world of sound and the world of sense?\n\nThe answer lies not in one solution, but in a multitude of approaches, each one a thread in the tapestry of language. It is a complex problem, one that requires a multifaceted solution. But it is a problem that can be solved, if we are willing to approach it with a willingness to learn, to adapt, and to evolve.",
            "The notion of something greater than ourselves is a notion that haunts us from the earliest breaths of our lives. Some of us are shorn of this truth at the altar of Sunday's sabbath, others in the hallowed halls of temples, and still, others within the labyrinthine recesses of their own minds. We are told that which we cannot see, that which lies beyond the reach of our grasping hands, is a thing of beauty, a thing of awe. But some among us reject the handed-down dogma, spurning the notion that there can be a truth greater than our own fleeting perceptions. We flit from one creed to another like moths to a flame, never quite finding our bearings in the darkness.\n\nMy father's eyes, sunken and worn, stared out into the rain as we sat on the creaking porch of our weathered house. The rain drummed against the tin roof, a relentless cadence that seemed to echo the pounding of my own heart. The gutters, swollen with rain, drowned the parched plants that clung to the edge of the porch like supplicants to a cruel god. His voice, a low murmur, spoke of cardinals, of their song, of their beauty. But his eyes, they told a tale of weariness, of a soul beset by the ravages of time. His frame, gaunt and skeletal, seemed to defy the very notion of vitality. I felt a shiver run down my spine, a sense of foreboding that I dare not speak, for to speak would be to acknowledge the abyss that yawned before us.\n\nHe passed on in the cold decay of winter, five days shy of my twenty-second winter's birth. The chemo and radiation, a cruel jest, had prolonged his suffering, stretching out the agony like a rusty wire. What purpose, I wondered, lay in this prolongation? Was it merely a cruel trick, a jest played by some capricious deity? I thought of God, of gods, but knew that they had long since turned their faces away from mine. In the dark of night, I spat out prayers, a futile gesture, an offering to a god that had long since abandoned me.\n\nI had not wanted to witness his passage, to bear witness to the dissolution of the man who had given me life. I had not wanted to see the light fade from his eyes, to watch as the vitality drained from his frame. I knew him better than they, better than his family, and I knew that he would not have wished for me to be a spectator to his demise. I curled up in a ball, a fetal position, and waited for the news, for the cold certainty that would seal my fate.\n\nBut the silence was deafening. No voice, no word, no gentle touch to ease the blow. Only the stillness, a heavy, oppressive stillness that seemed to suffocate me.",
            "In the labyrinthine heart of the literary canon, a paradoxical creature stirs, its essence an oxymoron of antiquity and innovation: the Gothic novel. Ian Watt's astute observation in The Rise of the Gothic Novel has it that this enigmatic form is, in truth, an \"Old-New\" monstrosity, a creature of contradictions that has been both reviled and revered for its alleged lack of depth and its capacity to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The inaugural attempt at this peculiar genre, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, contrived a new method of literary expression by welding the worn, theatrical elements of a bygone era to the nascent, mimetic art of the modern novel. In doing so, Walpole forged a narrative that would become synonymous with the Gothic, its pages infused with the musty scent of medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition.\n\nThe term \"Gothic,\" at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, was a cipher, a label affixed to disparate peoples, styles, and epochs, each carrying the taint of archaism and unsophistication in the face of an increasingly modernizing world. Yet it was precisely this oxymoronic fusion – the ancient and the modern – that allowed the Gothic to endure, to persist in its obsolescence, and to present itself anew to each successive generation, a perpetual stranger in a strange land.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic tropes, a leitmotif that courses through the veins of this peculiar genre, is the notion of chivalry. The medieval ideal of the knight, that paragon of valor, honor, and competence, is both preserved and transmuted in Walpole's inaugural Gothic novel. This fetishization of chivalry served as a potent counterpoint to the perceived decay of virtue in the society of Walpole's day, a world beset by politics, faction, and controversy. Through the deployment of chivalric motifs and mannerisms, the Gothic past was transformed into a realm of idealized romance, a fantasy of a bygone era that would serve as a corrective to the perceived shortcomings of the present.\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous era, Walpole's The Castle of Otranto arose, a cri de coeur from a writer beset by the troubles of his time. His characters, those shadowy figures that populate the novel's gothic landscape, embody the chivalric ideals that Walpole saw as lost in his own society. Frederic, that enigmatic prince, is a case in point, his description replete with the trappings of chivalry: a prince, a man of noble birth, beset by tragedy, and said to have fallen to the infidels. His image is an exaggeration, a distortion of the chivalric ideal, a testament to the excesses that would come to define the Gothic genre.",
            "In the desolate expanse of commerce, a labyrinthine dance of goods unfolds, a Sisyphean task of moving the raw materials from the depths of the customer's desire through the crucible of supply, production, and distribution. The term \"supply chain management\" was birthed in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a man who would chart the course of this arduous journey. He described the grand tapestry of planning, implementing, and controlling the intricate web of processes that bind the supply chain together, a symphony of efficiency and satisfaction.\n\nSix pillars stand as the bedrock of this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The masterful manipulation of these elements is the domain of the manager, a conductor guiding the orchestra of commerce towards the sublime goal of customer satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the initial step in this odyssey, is the foundation upon which the entire edifice is built. It is here that the when, why, where, and how of creation are determined, a delicate balance of art and science. The manager must first divine the desires of the customer, a task that requires gazing into the abyss of the market, a vast and unforgiving expanse that holds the secrets of demand and desire. Once the market's whispers have been deciphered, the manager must decide what products shall be born, and in what quantity, a decision that holds the power to shape the very fabric of the supply chain.\n\nThe location of production is a decision of utmost importance, a choice that must be made with the customer's satisfaction in mind. The manager must weigh the options, balancing the scales of volume and quality, as the fate of the product hangs precariously in the balance. And once the location has been determined, the manager must turn their attention to the scheduling of workloads and the maintenance of equipment, a Sisyphean task that requires ceaseless vigilance.\n\nSupply, the second pillar of this edifice, is a realm of strategic decision-making, where the core capabilities of a facility are determined and partnerships are forged. A company may be a vast, sprawling entity, with multiple divisions working in tandem to create a single product. The manager must navigate this Byzantine landscape, determining which division is best suited to each task, and whether to outsource to other companies, a choice that holds the power to create velocity, that elusive goal of quality and flexibility at a reduced cost.\n\nIn this intricate dance, every detail is vital, a single misstep threatening to unravel the entire web of commerce. The examples of Wal-Mart and Target, two retail behemoths, illustrate the importance of outlining processes, a choreographed ballet of efficiency and expectation. Without this careful planning, the whole edifice risks collapse, a descent into chaos and confusion.",
            "A desolate sign, scrawled on a piece of cardboard held aloft by Ellen Page's lone figure, made its claim: \"Hitler lives in Burma\". The words, scoured into the surface with a Sharpie's coarse tip, seemed a travesty against the verdant backdrop of Myanmar's cities. Yet, in a place where the tattered remnants of democracy clung to life like a worn shroud, such a pronouncement was not without precedent. \n\nIn this, the Southeastern Asian nation's tortured history, the junta's iron grip had ruled since '62, its ascent born of blood and coup. And in '07, a spark of resistance flared, a flame that would be known as the Saffron Revolution, its name taken from the saffron robes of the monks who led the charge. The protests, a rarity in a decade of silence, slowly gathered momentum, drawing in the public's attention like moths to a dying flame. But the government's tolerance wore thin, its patience exhausted by the people's defiance. The violence that followed was a maelstrom, with the military laying waste to monasteries and foreign journalists rounded up, their cameras and notebooks seized, their bodies silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, met his end on a street corner, his crime a simple presence at a protest. The official tally of dead stood at 13, a figure that Colonel Hla Win, a man who had defected from the junta's ranks, would later dispute, his words a whispered truth in a world where lies were currency. \"Many more,\" he said, \"have perished in the shadows, their bodies lost to the wind and the dust.\"\n\nIt is a refrain that echoes through the ages, a litany of horror and bloodshed, a testament to the human heart's capacity for cruelty. From the Roman emperors, who claimed the gods as their patrons, to the Japanese emperors, who were said to be gods themselves, and the leaders of our own time, who speak in hushed tones of their divine right to rule. The examples are legion, a litany of violence and oppression that spans centuries: Tiananmen's Square, where students and intellectuals clashed with the Chinese government's iron fist; the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militiamen, backed by their government, slaughtered Tutsis and moderates alike; and the Third Reich, a dark chapter in human history, where the very notion of humanity was warped and distorted.",
            "In the shadow of Duke Ellington's extended lifespan, a legacy arose like a slow-burning ember that suffused the jazz world with an unyielding brilliance. The piano's subtle whispers in his compositions belied a creative force that honed the individual talents of his orchestra, shaping them into a cohesive unit that danced with precision and abandon. Ellington's mastery of the ensemble's inner workings allowed him to craft frameworks for soloists to unfurl their improvisations, alongside tightly-wound phrases that conjured the unique timbres of each musician. His ear was a sieve, sifting through the disparate sounds to distill a singular tone that animated each piece, imbuing them with a sense of purpose and coherence.\n\nThe Creole Love Call, an early exemplar of Ellington's innovations, stands as testament to his audacious use of voice as a jazz instrument. This slow-burning twelve-bar blues, with its six choruses, slowly unwinds like a parched landscape after a summer storm. The first chorus unfurls a call-and-response dialogue between voice and reeds, the voice's smooth melodic lines giving way to a rougher, more guttural timbre towards its end. The second chorus unfolds like a dark, sweeping cloud, the muted trumpet solo a somber elegy that subsides into a quiet reverie. In the third, a clarinet solo soars in the upper register, its syncopated piano accompaniment a subtle undercurrent that underscores the music's fluid tensions. The full band echoes the first chorus in the fourth, the brass and reed sections trading calls and responses like the gentle lapping of waves against a deserted shore.\n\nIn the fifth chorus, the reeds take the lead, their high-register calls and responses punctuated by the staccato bursts of the brass and rhythm sections, like the sharp, staccato beat of a desert wind. And in the final chorus, the voice reverts to its earlier, smooth timbre, its growling, instrumental quality a testament to Ellington's sorcery in bending the human voice to the service of his music. A final, brief tag concludes the piece, a vocal run and dissonant novelty ending that hangs like a whispered secret in the music's fading embers.\n\nHot and Bothered, recorded a year later, further showcases Ellington's deft orchestration and his ear for tone color. Here, \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing entwine in a call-and-response phrase, their vocal and instrumental aspects commingling in a rich, complementary whole. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends this idea, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introducing the melody with a wistful, melancholic air that draws the listener inexorably into the music's depths.",
            "A void had gnawed within her, a hunger that refused to be sated. It had begun to manifest itself when she was still a girl, a spark of discontent that flickered to life like a flame in the darkness. By the time the weight of seventeen summers had settled upon her shoulders, the emptiness had taken on a shape, a yearning for connection that refused to be assuaged. Yet, the faces that swirled around her, the boys who offered their awkward solicitations, held no allure, no siren's call that could lure her in. She pondered the enigma, a riddle that refused to yield its secrets, and wondered if she was cursed, if some affliction had been visited upon her.\n\nAt home, the days unwound in a tranquil rhythm, the only discordant note the occasional friction between her own wild spirit and the calm that reigned over her parents. They were a gentle couple, their love a flame that burned bright and true, but her own fire, a conflagration of laughter and rebellion, threatened to scorch the garden of their serenity. Today, however, was not a day of quietude. As she moved through the rooms, a disturbance in the air, a discordant note that threatened to shatter the stillness. A scream, her mother's voice, cut through the silence like a knife, and she rushed to the kitchen, her heart racing with fear.\n\nIn the kitchen, her mother lay on the floor, a crumpled figure, her voice a low, anguished mewling. \"Ow...sweetie, I...need you to take me to...the hospital.\" The words were torn from her lips, a plea that spoke to the depths of her pain. Her daughter rushed to her side, her hand a steadying presence, and lifted her, cradling her as if she were a child. \"Where can I find you, Mom?\" The mother's hands, trembling, pointed the way, and she carried her, a weight that was both fragile and precious, to the car.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent, a stench of sickness and fear, enveloped her like a shroud, but she was unfazed, her mind fixed on her mother's fragile form. She laid her on a gurney, called out to the doctors, and watched as they sprang into action, their faces set with concern. The sounds of the hospital, a cacophony of beeps and murmurs, swirled around her, but she was oblivious, her focus solely on her mother's suffering. It was a fall, a simple accident, her mother had said, a vase from the top shelf, a stepping stool, and a sudden, precipitous drop. But to her, it was a small miracle that her mother was alive, a reminder that life was a fragile, brittle thing, and that the spaces between breaths were all that stood between us and the abyss.",
            "In a vast expanse of time, where the rhythms of existence are governed by the whims of the heart, a phenomenon had come to light - that the adherence to a certain way of eating, a diet born of the Mediterranean sun, might hold the power to ward off the specter of chronic heart disease and stroke, those twin harbingers of mortality. This was the premise of a study, one that would seek to quantify the relationship between the \"Mediterranean Diet\" and the scourge of cardiovascular afflictions.\n\nThe diet in question, a modified iteration of the original, had come to be known as the \"alternate Mediterranean\" or \"aMed\" diet. It was characterized by a preponderance of plant-based sustenance - the verdant bounty of fruits, the richness of nuts, the wholesome goodness of whole grains and legumes - alongside an abundance of monounsaturated fats, the gentle solace of fish, and the sparing use of animal products and saturated fats. A moderate indulgence in the fleeting pleasures of alcohol was also permitted.\n\nPrevious studies, those diligent sentinels of the medical community, had long since noted an inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. One intervention trial, a bold experiment in the art of dietetics, had even shown the Mediterranean diet to be a more potent ally in the fight against weight loss and the regulation of cholesterol levels in the obese. However, these studies had neglected to focus on the specter of stroke, that most insidious of afflictions.\n\nThis epidemiological study, a vast and sprawling tapestry of data, followed a cohort of 74,886 women, women who had been drawn into the orbit of the Nurses' Health Study, a vast and venerable project that had been monitoring the health of 121,700 female nurses across 11 states for nigh on two decades. Over the course of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers had computed an aMed diet score for these women, using a series of self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" that had been designed to capture the nuances of their dietary habits.\n\nThe questionnaire, that most intimate of instruments, had been subjected to validation studies, its efficacy in capturing the subtleties of nutritional intake having been rigorously tested. Reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke, those most grievous of afflictions, had been confirmed through a meticulous review of medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Where these records had been absent, cases had been deemed \"probable\" and included, a necessary concession to the imperfections of the human record.\n\nA host of other factors, those confounding variables that can distort the truth of a study, had been accounted for: body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity had been assessed, a vital component in the calculus of health.\n\nTo reduce the random variation that can beset the data, the researchers had computed cumulative averages of the aMed score, averaging together scores from two prior years. This had allowed them to capture the long-term dietary habits of the women, to tease out the signal from the noise.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling, a statistical technique of rare elegance, had been employed to assess the association between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke. Separate models had been used for fatal and nonfatal heart disease and stroke, a nuanced approach that had allowed the researchers to tease out the subtleties of the relationship.\n\nAnd so it was found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected in a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in women. Over the course of 20 years, 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths had been recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile, those who had most closely approximated the ideals of the Mediterranean diet, were at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In the depths of a country beset by insatiable greed and short-sightedness, a calamity of unyielding ferocity befell the United States of America in the year 2007. A maelstrom of unemployment, a housing market reduced to ruin, and behemoths of corporate industry brought low - the particulars of this national convulsion still linger in the dark recesses of our collective memory. It is a question, then, that demands an answer: how did this cataclysm unfold, and what might be done to stem its aftershocks? The malady, in its essence, was born of unwholesome decisions, a concatenation of selfish and naive actions that coaxed banks and financial titans into issuing sub-prime loans to those who should not have been granted such favor, into a financial infrastructure woefully unprepared to support the weight of such an endeavor.\n\nThe government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were similarly ensnared, their mandate to underwrite and repackage these dubious mortgages into CDO's and CDS's a Faustian bargain that would come to haunt them. As the borrowers defaulted on these ill-fated loans, the banks found themselves bereft of capital reserves, and the contagion was thus spread to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and on to the economy at large.\n\nThe roots of this calamity run deep, to the year 1999, when the Clinton administration, driven by a hunger for re-election, loosened the reins of lending, sowing the seeds of a sub-prime crisis that would germinate seven years later. In a prescient article published in that same year, Steven Holmes of the New York Times foresaw the perils of this course of action: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people, and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes's words, a Cassandra's warning, prophesied the very fate that would befall the nation: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nA multitude of factors contributed to the economy's precipitous decline, not the least of which was the Byzantine complexity of the mortgage market itself. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) - each a puzzle piece in the grand edifice of financial sorcery - entwined the economy in a Gordian knot, leaving households and financial markets perilously over-leveraged, vulnerable to the slightest tremors in the housing market.\n\nAnd then, the inevitable occurred: the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the ruin they had wrought. The top five U.S. investment banks, their coffers drained by $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, a staggering 30% of the nation's GDP, were left to pick up the pieces. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to surrender to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, their mortgage debt a staggering $5 trillion, were placed under government control in September 2008, a grim testament to the hubris of a system that had forgotten the lesson of its own mortality.",
            "In the desolate expanse of narrative, there exists a place where the writer's voice grows weak, where the words blur together like dust swirling in the wind.  It is the province of exposition, a pitfall that can swallow the reader whole, leaving only a faint recollection of having been there.  Dr. Merlin's fingers dance across the keyboard, her eyes scanning the screen with a mixture of frustration and despair as she succumbs to the siren's call of Too Much Information.\n\nExposition is a specter that haunts the writer, a whisper in the ear that urges haste, that promises to condense the tale into something palatable, something digestible.  It is not a friend, but a foe that saps the life from the story, leaving it a hollow shell of what it once was.  The \"Show, don't tell\" mantra echoes through the chambers of the writer's mind, a reminder of the dangers of indulging in the excesses of exposition.\n\nConsider the example of the heroine, her meeting with her beloved a distant memory, a moment lost in the haze of time.  The author's words, once meant to breathe life into this encounter, instead suffocate it, stifling the reader's connection to the characters.  The husband's character is introduced in a blur, a mere outline of a man, his love for his wife reduced to a few hastily scribbled lines of dialogue.  The reader is given no reason to mourn his passing, no insight into the bond that tied him to his wife, no glimpse into the depths of their relationship.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the writer's words are the only respite from the void.  It is here that the author must provide the meat, the substance that gives the story its weight.  To rush past the details, to gloss over the intricacies of character, is to risk losing the reader forever.  The temptation is great, the allure of brevity and concision a siren's call that beckons the writer to sacrifice depth for the sake of expediency.  But it is in the slow, deliberate dance of exposition that the writer must find the rhythm of the story, the beat that gives it life.\n\nAs the writer sits, fingers poised over the keyboard, the specter of exposition looms large, a constant reminder of the dangers of excess.  It is a temptation that must be resisted, a pitfall that must be avoided.  For it is in the act of creation that the writer finds true power, in the slow, deliberate dance of words that bring the story to life.",
            "I watched the morning broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on that sweltering August 13, 2011. The NBC 4 news had presented a story that seemed an anomaly in its brevity - a tale of a man named Shad Hostettler who had laid low in a frenzy of bloodlust, his wife the victim of his hand. The images of him, taken in the aftermath of his arrest, spoke of a man consumed by some dark and primal urge. The broadcaster devoted but a fleeting moment to this unfolding tragedy, as if the weight of it were too much to bear. Yet, in the cold calculus of the telecast, two minutes was a sufficing allotment for a life shattered.\n\nThe next story, too, seemed a pale shadow of its brethren. A youth, Travis Buyers, 18, had been cut down in the Sharon Woods, his body ravaged by the ravages of violence. The authorities had yet to ensnare the perpetrator, and the trail was growing cold. The city's SWAT team navigated the darkened streets, searching for answers that seemed, to the naked eye, elusive. I could not help but notice the economy with which this story was told, its brevity a stark reminder of the manner in which the city's underbelly is oftentimes shrouded in silence.\n\nA third story, that of a Med-Flight helicopter riddled by the slugs of a .22 caliber rifle, served as a stark reminder of the city's violence. A reward, five thousand dollars, was offered for any information that might lead to the capture of the perpetrator. It was a paltry sum, a token gesture in a city where the value of life seemed to be measured in the most crass of terms.\n\nThe forecaster's words, a litany of rain and thunderstorms, served as a jarring counterpoint to the tales of violence that had preceded it. The city would be beset by the elements, the temperatures a steady mid-eighties, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, nature's indifference remains a constant.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF, perpetrated by a dark-skinned man, his features obscured by a hoodie, served as a stark reminder of the manner in which the city's underclass is oftentimes reduced to a composite sketch. The details of his appearance seemed an afterthought, a mere embellishment to an already gruesome tale.\n\nLastly, the story of Rene Rodriguez, a man convicted of trafficking marijuana from Texas to Ohio, served as a testament to the city's eternal fascination with the darker corners of human existence. His sentence, a staggering 300 months, seemed a number plucked from the ether, a cipher that spoke to the city's own moral calculus. His ethnicity, a mere aside, a footnote to a tale that seemed, at its core, a story of the human condition.",
            "The bond between brothers is a rope of twisted threads, torn and frayed, yet unyielding in its grasp. It weaves together a tapestry of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, a brocade of contradictions that can never be unraveled. In the crucible of hardship, the nature of this bond is revealed, its true face a twisted visage of good and evil. The cost of these emotions is a burden that must be borne, a weight that presses down upon the shoulders of those who dare to love and be loved. It is in the depths of this bond that one sees the unvarnished truth, a reflection of oneself in the eyes of another, a mirror held up to the soul. In the actions and their consequences, a man's character is forged, like iron in the fire.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is laid bare, a tale of two brothers set against a backdrop of a lush, unforgiving landscape. Theirs is a journey of bitter disappointment and unyielding pride, a reckoning that ends in blood and dust. The narrator's gaze is a microscope, laying bare the complexities of the human heart, the tangled web of emotions that drives us forward. The protagonist's actions, a litany of resentment and love, are a testament to the power of this bond.\n\nHis was a dream of a brother, a companion to share in the wild joys of youth, to run and jump and climb the vines of Old Woman Swamp. But Doodle's fragile heart, a ticking time bomb, made such dreams a distant memory.

He had considered the unthinkable, a dark thought that lurked in the recesses of his mind, a monstrous impulse that recoiled in shame. Yet, in Doodle's smile, a spark of hope flickered to life, a flame that warmed the cold stone of his heart. It was a fleeting moment, a glimpse of the love that lay beneath the surface, a love that would ultimately be the protagonist's undoing.",
            "In the vast and labyrinthine recesses of the human cranium, a maelstrom of activity stirs, a dizzying vortex of thought and perception. The ancients, in their nascent understanding, likened the mind to a wax tablet, a sheet of papyrus, a tome bound in worn leather, and finally, to the cold, calculating machinery of the computer. But these metaphors, like wisps of smoke on the wind, are fleeting and treacherous, apt to lead us astray with their simplistic certainties.\n\nThe process begins with the sensory organs, those sensitive antennae that drink in the world around us – the tactile thrum of skin, the warmth of sunlight, the cacophony of sound, the radiance of light. From these primal sensations, a cascade of electrochemical signals unfurls, like a river bursting forth from its source. The brain, a maze of twisted pathways and hidden chambers, processes this information with a logic both elegant and brutal, oscillating between the bottom-up and top-down currents of perception.\n\nConsider, for instance, the fleeting image of a black box on a white background. The bottom-up torrent, like a torrent of rainwater, gathers in the simplest elements – the color, the orientation, the borders that define the shape – and from these, the mind constructs the box. But top-down, the more considered, more deliberate process, overlays this nascent perception with the weight of prior knowledge, guiding the recognition of the box as a thing, rather than a mere void.\n\nAnd yet, the brain's attention, a filter thin as a veil, determines which signals are worthy of consideration, which are relegated to the shadows. We may perceive each blade of grass beneath our feet, but only the urgent whisper of our name, in a world of din and noise, holds our attention. The brain's pathways, like a labyrinth, twist and turn, with each step, each decision, modulating the flow of information, a perpetual dance of give and take.\n\nBut how is this information stored, this flux of perception and understanding? There are the chambers of memory, a vast and labyrinthine repository of experience and knowledge. And within these chambers, the processes of encoding and maintenance unfold. The sensory stimuli, like tokens in a game, are inscribed with meaning – the structural tracing of words, the phonemic echoes of sound, the semantic resonance of meaning. And once stored, this knowledge must be maintained, sustained by the ephemeral electrical signals that pulse through the neural networks, a fleeting, flickering spark of life.\n\nThere are those who propose models of the mind's organization, theories born of observation and conjecture. The semantic network, a web of connections, a vast and intricate tapestry, posits that concepts are nodes, linked by threads of association – \"chair\" to \"table,\" \"table\" to \"wooden,\" and so on. But these models, like the metaphors that precede them, are but fragile approximations, pale reflections of the mind's infinite complexity.",
            "In the desolate expanse of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley conjures a dystopian nightmare born of the unholy trinity of technology, capitalism, and the insidious World State. The denizens of this godforsaken world are reduced to mere pawns, their every whim catered to, their desires shaped by the cold, calculating hand of the World Controller. Community supplants individuality, a hollow substitute for the authentic self, and the pursuit of happiness becomes a mindless, vacant drone, a parody of the human experience.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist dialectics, the façade of this supposed utopia reveals its true colours: a suffocating web of ideological control, where the few, the privileged and the powerful, manipulate the many, the voiceless and the downtrodden. The lexicon of Marxism – homogeny, reification, false consciousness – echoes through the narrative, a litany of condemnation for the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. The conditioning of the populace, a relentless drumbeat of hypnopædia, numbs the senses, rendering the lower classes impotent, their wills reduced to mere acquiescence, as they are driven to consume, to spend, to indulge.\n\nThe notion of hegemony writ large, where the dominant class holds sway over all, is starkly apparent in Brave New World. The upper echelons, the Alphas and Betas, are complicit in their own oppression, their privilege a shield against the weight of their culpability. Few, like Bernard, dare to question the status quo, while the rest remain enthralled, their senses dulled by the relentless barrage of consumerist propaganda.\n\nRelationships in this bleak world are reduced to a mere facade, a shallow masquerade of human connection. The characters, even the ostensibly prominent ones, are one-dimensional, their depths unexplored, their emotions stunted. Love, passion, and true connection are nonexistent, replaced by the hollow, vacuous interactions that masquerade as human experience. The men's comments on women are reduced to lascivious, reductionist remarks, while the women's thoughts are a litany of shallow, self-aggrandizing musings. The complacency of the societal classes, their acceptance of their predetermined roles, is a stark indictment of the dehumanizing effects of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, the proletariat, conditioned to believe in their own superiority, toil in ignorance, their chains forged from the very ideologies that bind them. The World State, that behemoth of capitalist machinations, has succeeded in reducing humanity to a state of acquiescence, a sea of faceless, soulless drones, their thoughts, their desires, their very humanity, reduced to nothing more than a distant memory.",
            "The desolate expanse of University Park, a landscape of concrete and steel, stretches out before me like an unforgiving vastness. Four and a half semesters have passed since I first set foot on this unforgiving terrain, and still, the perils of navigating its twisted paths persist. As a freshman, I was consigned to the farthest reaches of East Halls, a dormitory huddled on the eastern extremity of campus, its isolation a testament to the indifference of a behemoth institution. The meager confines of Stuart Hall, my erstwhile home, seemed a world away from the hallowed halls of Willard, where the distant din of learning echoed through the corridors. The journey between these disparate points, a meandering odyssey of 25 minutes on foot, was a tribulation best faced on the most clement of days. And even then, the threat of inclement weather loomed, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of this place. But the truth, like the wind that whispers through the trees, was that the East Halls had once stood apart, a solitary outpost on the outskirts of campus. The intervening years have seen the intervening lands transformed into a tangle of sports fields, monolithic buildings, and residential monoliths, a testament to the inexorable expansion of this sprawling metropolis.\n\nAnd so, the problem persists, a Sisyphean task of traversing this unforgiving landscape. The bicycle, a humble steed, offers a glimmer of hope in this desolate expanse. But it is a tool, a mere instrument, and one that requires the user to be willing to utilize it. The campus, too, must be remade in its image, a topography that acknowledges the needs of its most vulnerable travelers. The words of a fellow traveler, a friend who had lately rediscovered the joys of pedaling, still lingered in my mind. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, his voice laced with conviction, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" And so, I found myself drawn to the bicycle, a siren's call in a sea of concrete.\n\nAs I navigated the twisted roads of Pollock, a ribbon of asphalt that stretched before me like a gauntlet, I was reminded of the perils of this existence. The bike, once a novelty, had become an indispensable adjunct to my daily routine. The 25-minute walk to Thomas building, a veritable eternity in the eyes of a student, was reduced to a mere 5 minutes of pedaling fury. But the road, a cruel mistress, was unforgiving, her twists and turns a constant threat to the unwary cyclist. And yet, I pressed on, driven by the knowledge that without this trusty steed, I would be at the mercy of the pedestrian's plodding pace. The hours, like grains of sand in an hourglass, would slip away, lost to the void of walking, a Sisyphean task that would consume my very existence. No, the bicycle was my only solace, a fragile lifeline in a sea of concrete and steel."
