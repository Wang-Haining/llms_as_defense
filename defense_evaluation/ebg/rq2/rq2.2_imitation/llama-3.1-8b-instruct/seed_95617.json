            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The pursuit of a profession in social work beckons like a siren's call, drawing me to the shadows of a world where the vulnerable are preyed upon by the very ones who should protect them. It is a world where the tender shoots of childhood are withered by the cruel hand of abuse, where the fragile bonds of family are rent asunder by the weight of neglect. And yet, it is a world I feel compelled to enter, to walk among the broken and the bereft, to offer what solace I can.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, certain values stand as beacons of hope: service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of relationships, both between individuals and within oneself. These are not ideals to be lightly considered; they are the very threads that weave the tapestry of a life worth living. I have walked among the ruins of others' lives, witnessed the desperation and the despair that can drive even the strongest to flee from their problems, to deny the darkness that follows them. And I have seen the frailty of those who turn to coping mechanisms that only serve to perpetuate their suffering.\n\nIt was in the midst of such a scene, one summer's day, that I chanced upon a young boy, his eyes wide with fear, his soul beset by the cruelty of those who should have protected him. I watched as he fled, as he sought refuge in the arms of a friend, and I knew then that I had to act. I had to take a stand, to offer what little I could to stem the tide of his suffering. And so, I spoke out, my words falling like a stone into a still pond, ripples of consequence spreading outward, touching the lives of all who heard them.\n\nBut it was not until I faced the parents, their eyes darting back and forth like trapped animals, that I understood the true nature of the darkness that had taken hold. They denied, they rationalized, they blamed the victim for the pain they had inflicted. And in that moment, I knew that I had to dedicate my life to the fight against such cruelty, to the defense of the vulnerable, to the pursuit of justice for the forgotten.\n\nSocial justice, that great and elusive ideal, beckons to me still. It is a call to arms, a clarion cry that echoes through the chambers of my heart. I have protested, I have spoken out against the injustices that I have seen, against the petty cruelties that masquerade as tradition, against the suffocating weight of conformity that seeks to stifle the unique voice of the individual. I have worn my hair in colors that defy the norm, I have pierced my skin with symbols of my defiance, I have stood shoulder to shoulder with those who would be marginalized, and I have spoken out against the systemic cruelties that seek to silence the voice of the oppressed.\n\nIn this, I am not alone. For in a world that claims to value the individual, yet seeks to crush their every step, I am a part of a long line of rebels, of outcasts, of those who would challenge the status quo and seek a world where the vulnerable are protected, where the marginalized are lifted up, and where the individual is free to be themselves, unencumbered by the weight of expectation.",
            "In the dark recesses of the human experience, there exist afflictions that beset the mind and body with equal ferocity. Insomnia, a disorder born of both flesh and circumstance, defies easy categorization. Its tendrils reach deep into the marrow of our being, sowing discord and unrest. The biological model, a cold and unforgiving lens, seeks to illuminate the genetic and physiological underpinnings of this malady. It looks to the neurons in the hypothalamus, those tiny, insistent whisperers that govern the ebb and flow of our waking and sleeping states. The orexin neurons, those subtle agents of slumber, contain within them the seeds of our very somnolence. The activation of the GABAB receptor, a receptor whose very presence is a testament to the intricate ballet of our internal workings, induces responses that promote the surrender to sleep. And yet, its inhibition, a mere whisper in the darkness, can conjure forth a reduction in anxiety, a stilling of the turbulent mind.\n\nThe mice, those creatures of curious observation, have been used to shed light upon this phenomenon. In the sterile confines of the laboratory, scientists have discovered that the phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons hold the key to our very ability to slumber. The administration of baclofen, a GABAB agonist, has been shown to prolong the duration of sleep, a testament to the subtle yet potent influence of this receptor. The implications of this study are far-reaching, speaking as they do to the very essence of our humanity. For if the genetic and environmental factors that shape our GABAB receptor are disrupted, the consequences are dire indeed. Our ability to rest, to find solace in the darkness, is compromised. And with it, the very fabric of our lives is rent asunder.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are far-reaching, a reminder that our struggles with insomnia are not solely the province of the individual. They are a testament to the complex interplay of our biology and our environment. The whisper of our genetic makeup, the sigh of our circumstances, all conspire to shape our experience of the world. And it is in this darkness, this void of sleep, that we find ourselves lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.",
            "In the depths of the mind, a chasm lies, a void that separates the external world from the inner recesses of comprehension. This is the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a condition where the brain's ability to decipher the whispers of the world is lost. It is not a deficiency of hearing, but rather a aberration in the labyrinthine corridors of the central nervous system. The brain, that great organ of perception, falters in its duty to translate the cacophony of sounds into a coherent language of meaning. The sufferer may hear the words, but they remain a jumble of discordant notes, a symphony without melody or harmony.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder emerged in the mid-century, a faint murmur of awareness that would grow into a crescendo of understanding. Researchers, like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, ventured into the uncharted territories of the mind, developing tests to navigate the unexplored landscapes of the brain. Kimura's work in 1961, a pioneering effort to unlock the secrets of dichotic perception, marked a turning point in the understanding of this enigmatic disorder.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are as varied as the sands of the desert. The afflicted may struggle to pinpoint the source of a sound, to distinguish between the competing demands of the environment. They may falter in the face of conflicting aural stimuli, their brain unable to synthesize the discrete elements into a coherent whole. They may fail to recognize the patterns that govern the world, the rhythms and cadences that govern the flow of human interaction. They may be unable to discern the nuances of speech, the subtle shifts in tone and inflection that convey meaning and emotion. And they may be lost in the sequence of events, unable to grasp the temporal relationships that underlie the world's unfolding drama.\n\nDiagnosis, a process fraught with uncertainty, requires a nuanced understanding of the patient's inner workings. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists must navigate the labyrinthine corridors of the mind, using a variety of tools to probe the depths of the sufferer's auditory world. They must observe the patient's responses to stimuli, the way they navigate the complexities of sound and silence. And they must interpret the data, sifting through the noise to uncover the underlying patterns that govern the sufferer's perception.\n\nNo single test can claim a high rate of diagnostic success, and the underlying causes of the disorder remain shrouded in mystery.

            "The veil of deception, a shroud that shrouds the soul, threatens to consume all in its path. Twelfth Night whispers a haunting truth: that the art of disguise, though a potent tool for deception, ultimately demands a reckoning. To remain hidden is to risk losing oneself, forever entombed in a prison of one's own making. The price of unmasking is steep: alienation, a chasm that yawns wide between the self and those who once knew us. We are forced to choose between the preservation of our own essence and the fragile bonds that tie us to others. And yet, how many of us will find solace in the neutrality of strangers, rather than the vitriol of those who once called us friend?\n\nIn the realm of gender, the masquerade assumes a particularly sinister form. What drives us to don the disguise of another, to abandon the fragile shell of our own identity? Viola's tale is a testament to the primal urge for self-protection, a desperate bid to survive in a world where the strong devour the weak. \"I'll lead you to a captain in this town,\" she says, \"where my maiden's weeds lie, and by whose gentle aid I was preserved to serve this noble count\" (5.1.247-249). In the unforgiving landscape of a foreign land, Viola assumes a masculine guise, a ruse that shields her from the ravages of those who would seek to do her harm. But in doing so, she sacrifices the very connections that might have sustained her, severing the ties that bind her to her own kind.\n\nHer ruse is so convincing that it ensnares even those who know her not, including the lovesick Olivia, who confuses her with her own brother, Sebastian. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). And yet, Viola's disguise also reignites the smoldering embers of her own desires, as she finds herself torn between the affections of Orsino and the unrequited passion that burns within her. \"Boy, thou hast told me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261). Thus, Twelfth Night becomes a curious case study in the alchemy of deception, where the hidden truths of the heart are forced into the light.\n\nBut is this merely a testament to the liberating power of self-discovery, or a commentary on the societal constraints that bind us? Does Olivia's ardor for Cesario betray a deeper longing for a world beyond the narrow bounds of her own desires, or is it simply a reflection of the prurient gaze that society casts upon those who dare to be different? The evidence suggests the latter, as she effortlessly transfers her affections to Sebastian, and regards Cesario/Viola as a sibling, rather than a love interest. \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315). In this, we see a wry mockery of the very society that sought to constrain her, a world where judgment is meted out based on the superficial trappings of appearance rather than the depths of the soul.",
            "In the vast expanse of German colonial rule, a stark reality emerged - one of brutality, a darkness that shrouded the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. To reduce this monstrosity to a simple label would be a travesty, a disservice to the complexities that defined the empire. Like the shifting dunes of the desert that stretched across its territories, the German colonial empire was a tapestry of varied policies and governance, a geography as unforgiving as it was diverse. The provision of education, too, was a patchwork of disparate threads, each colony weaving its own unique narrative.\n\nWhen the British claimed German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a population of Africans who possessed a certain... refinement, a literacy that spoke to the efforts of the Germans. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational endeavors were lauded by the chroniclers of the time. Yet, South West Africa presented a haunting contrast, a desolate landscape where the task of educating the natives was left to the benevolence of missionary societies, which received meager support from the government. And yet, the government lavished resources upon the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and regulating the missionary institutions with an iron hand. These policies would leave an indelible mark on South West Africa, a legacy that would persist long after the German rule had faded into memory. While other colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained a bastion of ignorance, a place where the overwhelming majority of its people remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The reasons for this divergence were complex, a tangled web of social, political, and economic factors that would prove resistant to easy explanation. This paper seeks to untangle these threads, to shed light upon the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans, and to illuminate the path that led to this divergent experience.\n\nA plethora of literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, a vast and often daunting corpus that stretches across languages and historical periods. Much of this work is in German, a tongue that spoke to the hearts of the colonizers, and was penned during or shortly after the period of German rule. The early writings were concerned primarily with describing the educational systems of the various colonies, a cataloging of the disparate ways in which the Germans sought to educate the natives. Later works, penned in English, expanded the discourse, comparing the educational systems of the different colonies and subjecting them to a more nuanced analysis. Among these studies, Cohen's work stands out, a comprehensive examination of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen's study seeks to explain the differences between the two colonies, and identifies the large settler population of South West Africa as a key factor in shaping its educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of contrasts, where the desert sands gave way to temperate climates, and the European population grew in tandem with the relative hospitability of the territory. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, a number dwarfed only by the settler population of East Africa, where 5,336 Europeans resided.",
            "In the shadow of a century, popular music has sprawled forth like a twisted labyrinth, its paths beset on all sides by an impenetrable thicket of genres. The very fabric of this music has been rent asunder by an endless proliferation of sub-genres, each one a splintered offshoot of its predecessor, a maddening proliferation that threatens to consume all in its path. And within this maelstrom, heavy metal stands as a behemoth, its dark and tortured form twisting and writhing like a living thing.\n\nBorn of the desperation and disillusionment of a bygone era, heavy metal has given rise to a thousand divergent strains, each one a fevered attempt to capture the essence of the music's dark and primal heart. It is a music of excess, a cacophonous tapestry woven from threads of volume, velocity, and sheer, unadulterated fury. The metal musician is a virtuoso, a technician of sound, his hands moving with a precision and speed that belies the chaotic, anarchic nature of the music itself.\n\nAnd yet, it is in the darkness that heavy metal finds its truest expression. The music is a reflection of the abyss that stares back at us from the mirror, a void that yawns open its maw and devours all in its path. It is a music born of the night, of the shadows that dance upon the wall, of the secrets that we dare not speak aloud. The Romantic era's dark, visceral legacy haunts the music, a ghostly presence that whispers secrets in the ears of the initiated.\n\nConsider the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\", a song that trembles with the aftershocks of a revolution yet to come. A response to the Rolling Stones' own dark and heavy incantations, it is a declaration of intent, a statement of purpose that announces the arrival of a new era in music. The darkness that seethes within its lyrics is a darkness that cannot be contained, a maelstrom of emotions that threatens to consume all in its path.\n\nIn this music, we find the twisted, nightmarish landscape of the human condition, a world of darkness and despair that stares back at us from the mirror. It is a music that defies categorization, a hydra-headed monstrosity that cannot be pinned down or contained. And yet, it is precisely this quality that has given rise to its enduring power, a power that continues to fascinate and terrify us to this day.",
            "In the somnambulant haze that precedes the stirrings of the surrealist dawn, an artist dwelled, his brushstrokes whispering secrets to the canvas. Henri Rousseau, a man beset by the specter of uncertainty, tortured by the demons of his own ambition. His masterpiece, The Dream, born in 1910, a testament to the turmoil that gnawed at his very soul. For in its ethereal landscapes and dreamlike visions, Rousseau poured out his deepest longings: the desire for recognition, for acceptance, for the validation of his craft by the very art world he revered.\n\nBut the path to such accolades was fraught with peril. Rousseau's journey was one of self-doubt and struggle, a Sisyphean effort to reconcile the artist within with the conventions without. To conform, to mimic the styles of his contemporaries, or to forge his own path, to stumble through the wilderness of his own creativity? The internal battle raged on, a maelstrom of conflicting desires that threatened to consume him whole.\n\nTo comprehend The Dream, one must delve into the labyrinthine corridors of Rousseau's biography. Born on a fateful May day in 1844, in the town of Laval, he was the son of a tinsmith, a man of modest means, blessed with a bourgeois prosperity that would prove a double-edged sword. No formal training in the arts, only the rough-hewn tools of a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, to guide his early years. The burden of his grief, the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, weighed heavily upon him, leaving only a daughter, Julia, to inherit his name. And so, in the midst of such sorrow, he turned to painting, a tentative step into the unknown, a quest for solace and redemption.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's brushstrokes spoke to the common man, a folk painter, unbridled by the conventions of the art world. His obsession with acceptance, a fire that burned bright, was a testament to his unyielding desire to be seen, to be heard, to be acknowledged. And yet, in the shadow of greatness, he toiled, his works lost in the annals of time, until the arrival of Matisse, a painter of a different ilk, driven by a different passion, a different purpose. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed, Rousseau's quest was one of seeking the mundane, the conventional, the trite, in order to be admitted to the rarefied world of the Artiste Français, while Matisse, on the other hand, strove to avoid the banal, to transcend the ordinary.",
            "In the depths of our existence, a mystic bond weaves itself between the threads of ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. It is a connection that has been posited by the great thinkers, a notion that cannot be easily unraveled. John Keats' words, like a whispered secret, echo through the ages: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" For in the marrow of our being, we sense the inextricable tie between the two, a bond that cannot be forged through the hammer of reason or the chisel of experience. We are drawn to it, like moths to the flame, without the need for instruction or tuition.\n\nOur understanding of the world is forged in fire and stone, a tapestry woven from the threads of knowledge and experience. Yet, we are drawn to the realm of ethics and aesthetics with a singular passion, a yearning that defies explanation. We seek to grasp the essence of what is beautiful, to pin down the unnamable, like a moth in the spider's web. But it is a pursuit that is doomed to fail, for in the world of art and morality, there is a limit to language, a horizon beyond which we cannot tread.\n\nConsider the Mona Lisa, that enigmatic smile, a riddle wrapped in a mystery. We may prattle on about the nuances of light and shadow, the play of perspective and contrast, but in the end, it is not these things that capture the essence of her beauty. When we are asked to describe what draws us to a work of art or literature, we falter, our words reduced to the feeble phrase, \"There's just something about it.\" It is a confession, a recognition that there are some truths that cannot be spoken, only felt.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's words come to mind: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" In the same way, ethics has a language that defies the tongue, a language that speaks directly to the heart. As the great philosopher said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this unnamable quality, this je ne sais quoi, that is the very essence of art and morality, the thread that weaves them together.\n\nWe experience both art and morality at a level that is both seen and unseen, a realm that lies beyond the reach of language. It is a connection that is strongest in literature, where the art of storytelling becomes a reflection of the human condition. As McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" In the end, it is this congruence that makes literature so vital, so essential to our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.",
            "The Germany of today, a land forged in the crucible of its storied past, stands as a testament to the indomitable will of its people. From the snow-capped peaks of the Alps to the unforgiving shores of the Baltic, the nation's roots run deep, a testament to the primordial forces that have shaped its culture. In the cities of München and Kiel, where the Rhine and Elbe rivers converge, a unique tapestry of traditions has unfolded, a rich brocade woven from the threads of distant tribes and forgotten eras.\n\nThe shadow of Germania looms large, a land of ancient mystery, its name shrouded in dispute among the scholars and sages of old. Some claim it arose from the Tungrians, a long-forgotten tribe, their identity lost to the sands of time. Others whisper that it was Julius Caesar who first coined the term, a distinction born of his wars against the Gauls, a people whose language and customs he sought to understand. In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Caesar penned a glimpse into the Germanic tribes, their ceaseless battles with the Gauls a testament to their unyielding spirit. \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine,\" he wrote, \"with whom they are continually waging war...They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)\n\nThe spear, that potent symbol of their warrior culture, has been proposed as the source of their name, a fierce and primal instrument of war that has left an indelible mark on the annals of history. Others point to the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" a testament to the Germans' unbridled passion and unwavering ferocity. And yet, the truth remains elusive, lost in the mists of time, a mystery waiting to be unraveled.\n\nTacitus, that master chronicler of the ancient world, penned a paean to the Germans in his De Origine et situ Germanorum, a sweeping narrative that revealed the secrets of their origins. \"I should regard them,\" he wrote, \"as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd so, the Germans remained, a people apart, their isolation a testament to their unyielding will. They traded with the Romans, serving in their legions, their skills forged in the furnace of battle. Yet, they remained aloof, a people unto themselves, their culture a unique and enigmatic blend of tradition and innovation. In the shadows of the Roman Empire, they waited, their patience a testament to their unyielding resolve. And when the time came, they emerged, a force to be reckoned with, their indomitable spirit forged in the crucible of their storied past. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "My gaze fell upon the scene before me, a canvas of desolation, a tableau of unassuming ordinariness. My mind, a void, a chasm, a hollow vessel, stirred with the weight of observation but refused to anchor itself to any abstract understanding, any framework of thought. The world, a tapestry of detail, unfolded before me, a vast and unyielding expanse of color and form, yet my consciousness remained detached, a fluid, unmoored thing, aware of the moment without attachment.\n\nA book, a dusty relic of a bygone era, lay on a shelf, its pages yellowed with age. 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain', a title that held a certain allure, a promise of secrets revealed, of hidden truths unveiled. An artist, a mentor, a guide, had counseled me to seek out this tome, to unlock the mysteries of the creative process. I had always been drawn to the act of creation, the thrill of bringing forth something from nothing. And so, with a sense of trepidation, I embarked upon this journey, a path that wound through the labyrinth of the human experience.\n\nThe square frame, a tool of the artist, a means of simplifying the complex, of distilling the essence of the scene before me. But on this day, in this moment, I was unable to impose this framework upon the world. The bowl, a simple, everyday object, sat upon a plain, unadorned table, a testament to the banality of existence. And I, a mere observer, stood transfixed, a moth to the flame of the mundane.\n\nPicasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of color – these were the benchmarks against which I measured my own creative endeavors. And yet, as I stood there, frozen in contemplation, I felt a stirring within me, a sense of possibility, of potential. The beginnings of 'Work in Brown', a nascent thing, a germ of an idea, took shape in my mind.\n\nMy hand, a instrument of creation, a extensions of my will, hovered above the surface of the paper, poised to bring forth life. But first, a more humble task, a necessary evil, beckoned. The toilet, a receptacle for the discarded, the unwanted, demanded my attention. A brown package, a loathsome thing, refused to yield to my efforts, stubbornly clinging to the porcelain. I stood, a sentinel, a guardian of the mundane, frowning in frustration.\n\nThe mop, a tool of my trade, hung loosely in my hand, a green tie, a garish splash of color, constricting my neck. I stood, a figure of desolation, a man lost in a sea of indifference. And yet, as I gazed upon the offending bundle, a sense of resolve washed over me. The flush, a soothing balm, a moment of peace, beckoned. And then, with a sense of resignation, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand in a makeshift mitt, a gesture both futile and defiant.\n\nAs I stood, a figure of desolation, a man lost in a sea of indifference, I felt a sense of calm, a sense of acceptance. The world, a vast and overwhelming expanse, receded into the background, and I was left with the simple, the mundane, the brown package, a thing both loathsome and beautiful.",
            "The killing fields of asphalt stretch out before them, a morass of steel and rubber where the young and the arrogant are cut down in their prime.  The statistics are stark, a grim litany of death and destruction that underscores the cruel fate of the teenage driver.  The National Institutes of Health posit that a significant portion of the blame lies with the fragile, untested brain of the adolescent, still reeling from the tumult of growth and development.  Inexperience, too, plays its part, a reckless indifference to the perils of the road that is as much a product of youth as it is of simple ignorance.\n\nThe presence of peers, those fluttering companions of the young, serves only to exacerbate the risk.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center bears witness to the corrosive influence of age and recklessness, a correlation as undeniable as it is sorrowful.  But the attempts to mitigate this carnage, to impose upon the young a semblance of restraint through provisional licenses and limited driving hours, only serve as a feeble palliative, a Band-Aid upon a wound that will not heal.\n\nThe real issue, as any honest examination of the data will reveal, is that the young are, as a group, woefully unprepared to confront the unforgiving realities of the road.  Marvin Zuckerman, a psychologist of unimpeachable credentials, has posited that the age of 18 is, even in this era of permissive indulgence, too young to be entrusted with the keys to a motor vehicle.  His research, borne of a keen understanding of the adolescent psyche, suggests that it is in the later teens and early twenties that the propensity for risk-taking begins to wane, a gradual lessening of the siren's call of reckless abandon.\n\nTo continue to issue licenses to the young, to indulge their passions for speed and thrill, is to invite a catastrophe of unspeakable proportions.  The demography of driving is about to shift, as the Baby Boomer's children come of age and take to the roads in their millions.  The prospect of unchecked carnage is a specter that haunts our collective conscience, a dire warning of what is to come if we fail to act.\n\nLegislation, it would seem, is the only bulwark against this onrushing tide of death and destruction.  Schools, those bastions of learning and wisdom, can continue to provide the necessary instruction in the art of driving, but the keys should remain out of reach of those who have not yet reached the age of reason, who have not yet tempered their impetuousness with a measure of prudence.  A provisional permit, a stepping stone to full licensure, can still be granted, but only after a period of practical instruction, honed to the number of hours deemed necessary by the majority of states.  Uniform, national legislation, rather than a patchwork of state-by-state regulations, is the only way to stem the tide of this national scourge.\n\nThis is no novel proposal, but a blunt acknowledgment of the facts, a recognition that we have been asleep at the wheel, that we have allowed our children to be slaughtered on the highways in a preventable carnage that is both tragic and senseless.",
            "In the musty recesses of the Library of Congress's vast repository of early Edison films, I found myself drawn to the trick films - fifteen in all, dating from 1895 to 1901. These early trifles, with their contrived manipulations, seemed to rely on the cunning art of editing to birth illusions. My study, a meandering path through the labyrinthine world of film, focused on unraveling the poetic essence of these trick films and charting the incremental deviations from the norm that appeared in a few of the later, more daring examples.\n\nIt was a peculiar thing, this turn-of-the-century trick film, bound to the strictures of the proscenium stage. Composed within the foreordained frame, it eschewed the fluidity of camera movement, instead employing long, static shots and medium shots, its narrative tethered to the stilted conventions of the \"one shot, one film\" dictum. And yet, as the century wobbled forward, certain aberrant films defied these strictures, indulging in the novelty of multiple shots.\n\nA most striking feature of the trick films, a trait that linked them in a shared umbilical cord, was their predilection for filming within the confines of a proscenium set. The camera, an unyielding sentinel, remained rooted to its station, unswayed by the ebb and flow of action. This composition, a direct import from the theatre and vaudeville, a realm of smoke and mirrors, dictated the limitations of the trick films. The figures within these films, constrained by the dictates of the stage, moved only in a lateral plane, their paths predetermined by the spatial confines. Witness, for example, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors entered from the right, their movements confined to the horizontal axis, never once straying from the predetermined path.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style, a visual corollary to the theatre's stubborn adherence to tradition, also led to a dearth of close-up shots. The Edison catalog, a vast repository of trick films, yielded not a single instance of this more intimate, intrusive frame. The theatre, after all, had always been a realm of spectacle, where the entire performance was laid bare for all to see, framed by the unyielding borders of the stage. And so, the actors, rooted to the middle ground, never once ventured forth to breach the camera's gaze.\n\nIn these early trick films, a single conceptual shot was often the equivalent of a cinematic monolith, its brevity and self-containment a testament to the era's nascent understanding of the medium. Most trick films, confined to the realm of the minute or less, focused on the vaudeville-style trifles that had given birth to the genre: magic, disappearing acts, and the art of switching. And yet, a more discerning eye, one attuned to the subtle artifices of the trick film, would detect the seams where the individual shots were joined, the moment when the physical shot gave way to the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Observe, for example, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films, and note the subtle juncture where the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" commences, even as the film remains, to the viewer's eye, a singular, unbroken whole.",
            "In a time long past, a man named John Taylor stood resolute, a champion of the unwavering creed that had taken hold of his heart - the unyielding commitment to the ideals of Republicanism. His life, marked by the sweat and toil of the land, and a fleeting foray into the realm of politics, had tempered him like steel in the fire of conviction. For in the eyes of this ardent proponent, the very profession that had shaped his existence - the unforgiving yet majestic world of agriculture - held the secrets to a far more profound truth: the foundation upon which all his opinions on governance were built.\n\nHis vision for a nation, born of the promise of a tabula rasa, unencumbered by the weight of tradition, was a system of self-governance, wherein the voices of the people, uncorrupted by the taint of power, might yet speak with a voice of reason. And yet, it was not merely a naive utopian dream that drove him, but a deep understanding of the inherent duality that lay at the heart of humanity - the eternal struggle between the good and the evil that lurked within.\n\nFor Taylor, the notion of the \"state of nature\" was a cruel joke, a world where the strong preyed upon the weak, where the cunning and the ruthless held sway over the meek and the timid. But in the realm of civilization, he believed, this must not be the case. It was in this context that he posited the existence of a government, not as a panacea for the ills of humanity, but as a necessary bulwark against the darkness that threatened to consume all.\n\nA government, he argued, must be constructed with the awareness of the inherent duality of human nature, a duality that would forever be in conflict. \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.\" The good principles, he posited, were those that protected private property, fostered the growth of agriculture, and checked the insatiable vice of capitalism. A government founded on such principles, he believed, would stand the test of time, its equanimity unshaken by the vicissitudes of administration, which, inevitably, would be driven by avarice and self-interest.\n\nYet, it was not the absence of self-interest that was the problem, but rather its unchecked excesses, which gave rise to sub-societies that preyed upon the vulnerable. A good government, he argued, was necessary not to eradicate this frailty, but to contain it, to hold it in check, lest it consume the very fabric of society.\n\nTaylor's stance on the Constitution was equally resolute. He advocated for a strict construction, one that bound the Federal government to the strictures of the document, limiting its powers to those explicitly stated, lest it become an instrument of despotism. And yet, he was not naive to the dangers of a literal interpretation, which, without reference to the intent of the framers, could lead to corruption and abuse. For in his estimation, the Declaration of Independence remained the true charter of the United States, a document that spoke to the very essence of the nation's existence as a confederation of sovereign states, rather than a monolithic entity.",
            "The precipitous drop in commuter logs in the third month was a desolate sight, a stark reminder that the fervor of initiative had begun to wane. The onset of winter's chill, the campus shrouded in snow and ice, had doubtless claimed its share of cyclists and pedestrians, leaving the roads empty and still. And then, too, the end of the semester had brought a deluge of tasks and deadlines, a maelstrom that swept all else aside, including the humble commuter log. The holiday season, with its attendant festivities and distractions, had only served to further erode the already flagging participation. Classes, too, had resumed in late January, a reminder that the cycle of academic life had turned once more, leaving the log submissions lagging far behind.\n\nBut it was February, that blank and unforgiving month, that posed the greatest enigma. Had the project's initial momentum, that initial burst of energy and enthusiasm, simply burned itself out, leaving naught but a faint ember of interest? The Carpool Challenge Week, a desperate attempt to rekindle the flames, had paid some dividends, yielding a modest increase in submissions for March. Yet, it remained a faint glimmer of hope in an otherwise desolate landscape. The challenge, it seemed, lay not only in countering the natural ebb and flow of engagement, but in combating the fundamental allure of the automobile, that stalwart companion to our daily lives.\n\nThe prizes, too, had played their part, a meager incentive in a world where the freedom of the open road is a cherished privilege. Gift certificates to local eateries and shops had been our offering, a paltry reward for a sacrifice that few were willing to make. It was a curious thing, indeed, to consider what might have been achieved with more substantial prizes – a bicycle, a hybrid car, an electric vehicle – symbols of a different way of living, one that few were willing to adopt. The prizes, however, remained static throughout, a constant in a world that was ever-changing.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that a more dynamic approach might have been required, one that promised a greater reward for those who chose to brave the elements, to forgo the comfort of their own vehicles. Had we announced a series of escalating prizes, a ladder of rewards that grew higher and higher, perhaps we might have seen a greater surge in participation. But it was not to be. The logs, they remained stubbornly low, a testament to the enduring power of habit and the allure of the automobile.",
            "In the desolate landscape of finance, there existed a creature known as the exchange traded fund, or ETF, a monstrosity born from the union of index, commodity, and asset, its form fluid and shape-shifting like the sands of the desert. It was said to possess the diversification of a sire, the benefits of single stock ownership a siren's call to the unwary investor. The promise of liquidity, of the ability to sell short, to buy on margin, to possess as few as a single share, was a tantalizing one, a whispered secret known only to the initiated. And yet, like the haunted landscape of the American West, there were costs, hidden pitfalls that lurked in the shadows. The expense ratios, a woeful toll, a burden borne by the investor, far lower than those of the average mutual fund, yet a weight to be reckoned with nonetheless.\n\nIn the twilight world of ETFs, the IHF loomed large, a behemoth of diversification, its top ten holdings a promised land of riches. But was it a mirage, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckoned the unwary investor to the precipice of financial ruin? To evaluate this monstrous creature, we narrowed our focus to the top ten holdings, those that comprised 63.58% of its assets, a fraction of the whole, yet a glimpse into the heart of the beast.\n\nThrough the lens of a chart, we beheld the Beta and Return of this subset of holdings, a snapshot of the ETF's very essence. And what did we find? The return, a tantalizing 6.11% greater than the ETF itself, a 16% increase, a siren's call to the investor. And the Beta, a mere .12 lower, a whisper of the safety that lay within. But was this a promise to be trusted? Or a lie, a deceitful whisper in the darkness?\n\nTo answer this, we turned to the standard deviation, that most unforgiving of metrics. We normalized the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, a cold calculation, devoid of passion or sentiment. And what did we find? A portfolio of just these ten holdings, a configuration of the ETF's very essence, offered a higher return, a lower Beta. But was this a statistical certainty, or a mere possibility? The answer, like the desert itself, remained shrouded in mystery.",
            "In the dim recesses of Edgar Allan Poe's oeuvre, \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to his command of the darker corners of the human experience. The reappearance of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, as noted by Mabbott, draws our attention to the rippling currents of influence that shaped his work. Virgil's utilization of the term, referencing the fabled island north of Britain, served as a point of departure for Poe's own exploration. Yet, it is in the realm of German literature that we find a more proximate source to which due acknowledgment is owed. Poe's affinity for the works of Goethe is well-documented, a fact that assumes added significance in light of the striking similarities between their respective creations.\n\nThe pertinence of this connection becomes apparent in the words of Karl J. Arndt, who, in his study of Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, discerns a marked homology between the two poets' works, with the conclusion that Poe was, in all likelihood, drawing upon Goethe's inspiration. The celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust, Goethe's magnum opus, published in two parts – the first in 1808, the second in the year of his passing, 1832 – contains, within its somber verse, a concise poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This narrative tells the tale of a monarch whose wife, in her final gesture of love, bestows upon him a goblet, only to succumb to the weight of his grief, which he assuages with an excess of drink and tears.\n\nThe parallels between this narrative and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, as if the latter stands in dark, funereal relation to the former. The King of Thulé's descent into the abyss of despair, his abandonment of the world, and his eventual surrender to the void, serves as a haunting mirror to the speaker's own anguish in \"Dream-Land,\" where the desolate landscape of Thule stretches out like a shroud, a realm of shadows and forgotten joy. The repetition of the term \"Thulé\" in Poe's work, a refrain that bookends \"Dream-Land,\" serves to underscore the connection to Goethe's poem, as if the speaker has stepped into the very realm of the King of Thulé.\n\nGoethe's stature as a literary giant is well-attested, and Poe's regard for him is evident in his admiration for Tennyson. Though the connection to Tennyson serves as a testament to Poe's erudition, it is the prevalence of Goethe's work in the cultural landscape of the time that provides a more immediate explanation for his influence. The multiple reproductions of Goethe's works, following the initial publication of Faust, would have assured Poe's familiarity with the German writer's oeuvre.",
            "The sterile sky hung above the market, a distant hum of indifference to the travails that unfolded beneath. In the realm of California's laws, a plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, seeks to claim punitive damages for the injuries she sustained after slipping on an applesauce spill within the walls of D&D Markets. The question looms: did the store manager, Paul Martin, act with malice, heedless of the probable harm that would befall those who traversed the store's aisles? The issue is not so simple as a yes or no, but rather a tapestry of intent and consequence, woven from the threads of knowledge and neglect.\n\nA judge, arbiter of the law, is unlikely to dismiss Palmer's claim out of hand. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful disregard for the probable harm that would result, and that the conduct itself was despicable. Palmer's argument is twofold: that Martin should have known the probable harm of neglecting the spill, given the precedent of multiple incidents in the months prior, and that he failed to act despite such knowledge. Though the claim that Martin's actions were despicable may be tenuous, it is not without merit, given the weight of six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, and Martin's inaction in the face of such knowledge.\n\nOn that fateful day, October 13, 2009, at five o'clock in the evening, Rich Wayne, a store employee, informed Martin of the spill in the aisle. Martin's response was a dismissive one, a brush-off to the concerns of his customer, and a prioritization of his own dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, approached Martin with the same news, and met with the same disregard. It was thirty minutes of inaction, a span of time that would prove calamitous for Palmer, who slipped and fell at 5:30 pm, sustaining a serious injury to her back. The store, D&D Markets, had seen five previous slip-and-fall incidents in the year prior, each a missed opportunity to correct a systemic flaw, each a harbinger of the disaster that would soon unfold.\n\nIn California, the law recognizes the right of a plaintiff to seek punitive damages for a breach of obligation, if the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of such intent, a despicable act committed with a willful disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts have come to characterize such conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, and a willful failure to avoid the consequences of such actions. It is this standard that Palmer will seek to satisfy, in her quest for justice and recompense.",
            "It has been nigh on four winters since I first set foot in a classroom, seated among the dusty tomes and worn desks of CBC.  There, amidst the ceaseless din of debate, one query unsettled the air: was Islam a faith born of hostility?  The question still festers, a suppurating wound that time has failed to heal.  After the calamitous events of 9/11, I watched as the media's stance on Islam underwent a precipitous shift, veering from a stance of abhorrence to one of saccharine tolerance.  A mere two decades ago, a presidential candidate with a Muslim name would have been unimaginable, yet now such a figure sits in the highest office of the land.\n\nThe life of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, a paradox that defies easy comprehension.  The biography that has come down to us presents a man who, far from the conqueror I had long believed him to be, was instead a martyr, a supplicant who bent his knee to the whims of fate.  One by one, the faithful flocked to his banner, drawn by the radiance of his conviction, not by the sword.  This narrative, I now see, was crafted to convey a man of humility, a holy man who required no proof of his divine calling.\n\nThere are, however, unsettling parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad.  The story of the multiplication of bread and milk, a miracle that fed the forty men in his company, stands out in particular.  This narrative, I suspect, was woven to present Muhammad as a man of quiet strength, a prophet who stood apart from the vainglorious trappings of power.  It is this strategy that troubles me, for it diminishes the singular majesty of Jesus Christ, a man who stood alone, unencumbered by the need for validation.\n\nThe biography, too, is replete with anecdotes that seek to establish the authenticity of the Prophet's teachings.  These tales, however, are often second- or third-hand, recounted by others, far removed from the event itself.  The result is a narrative that strains credulity, a patchwork of hearsay and legend.  I find it difficult to accept such a narrative as proof, for it lacks the weight of direct testimony.\n\nBut it is the portrayal of Muhammad as a paragon of virtue that most offend me.  This holy man, revered by millions, is often depicted as a figure of unassailable wisdom, of compassion and gentleness.  Yet the annals of history suggest otherwise, a more complex, more troubled figure, whose ascent to power was marked by bloodshed and strife.  I am left to wonder if the faithful are aware of the true nature of their Prophet, or if they remain blind to the darkness that shrouds his legacy.",
            "In the aftermath of Jesus' mortal coil, the teachings he left behind were eroded by the relentless tide of Christian thought.  Like a river's course, which winds its way through the landscape, ever-changing, ever-shifting, so too did the Christian faith.  The waters of tradition, the sediment of doctrine, and the currents of dogma all conspired to carry the faith further and further from its source.  Yet, in this vast, dark expanse of time, a faint glimmer of awareness begins to stir.  A growing number of souls, weary of the stifling weight of tradition, yearn to peel back the layers of dogma, to strip away the accretions that have accumulated like barnacles on a hull, and to rediscover the living, breathing Jesus at the heart of it all.  This will not be a swift or easy process.  It will be a gradual, reluctant, and painful one, like the unmooring of a ship from its anchors.  But it will happen.  History is replete with such reversals - the Roman Empire, once a bastion of paganism, became a Christian empire; our own nation, once a bastion of slavery, became a beacon of freedom.  And so too will the Christian faith undergo a great reversal, a great unwinding of the coils of time, a great unmaking of doctrine and dogma.  It will be a process of stripping away, of peeling back the layers, of returning to the raw, unvarnished Jesus, the Jesus who spoke in parables and paradoxes, who defied literal interpretation and beckoned us to the depths of the human heart.  To read his words as metaphor, not as dogma, is to join this great reversal, to embark on the journey back to the source, to the wellspring of faith itself.  And what did the world look like before the tides of Christian thought swept across it?  It was a world of Judaism, a world of the Hebrew scriptures, a world of monotheism and divine revelation.  A world of division and splintering, where the Jewish people were rent asunder by the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Zealots, each with their own interpretation of the divine.  But even in that fractured world, there was a common thread, a common purpose, a common humanity that underlay it all.  And so too will it be in the future, when the great reversal has taken place, and the Christian faith has returned to its source, when the waters have stilled and the sediment has settled.  The world will be a simpler, more unified place, where the spirit of Jesus shines forth, unencumbered by the weight of tradition, unvarnished by the distortions of time.",
            "The scabrous underbelly of human nature is laid bare in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, a bleak testament to the innate greed and self-aggrandizement that festers within the hearts of men. It is an abyss of unyielding avarice, where the pursuit of wealth and power supplants all else, leaving in its wake a trail of devastation and despair. The factory owners and managers, monarchs of the great industrial behemoths, reign with an iron fist, crushing all who dare stand in their way. They care not for the toll their relentless pursuit takes on the land, nor for the lives they shatter with each passing day.\n\nAs Sinclair's words paint a picture of the ravaged landscape, the smoke-belching chimneys pierce the sky like skeletal fingers, a grim reminder of the devastation wrought by human greed. The rivers of smoke that stream away to the horizon are a stark testament to the disregard with which the owners view the world around them, a world they seek to exploit for their own selfish ends. The pens that house the thousands of animals, the putrid runoff of their waste, are but a mere afterthought, a trifling concern in their unyielding quest for profit.\n\nNor do they spare a thought for the wretched souls who toil in their factories, their sweat and blood the lifeblood of the industry. \"A seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" is what Sinclair calls this place, a pit of unrelenting cruelty, where the dollar is the only currency that holds value. The workers are cogs in a machine, dispensable and replaceable, their humanity stripped away by the cold calculus of commerce. They toil in darkness, their hours long and grueling, their lives reduced to a mere existence. And when they are cast aside, discarded like so much refuse, they are left to pick up the shards of their shattered lives, with no solace, no aid, and no respite.\n\nIn this era, the workers were but helpless pawns, preyed upon by the unscrupulous and the ruthless. The unions, formed with the intention of protecting their interests, often proved to be wolves in sheep's clothing, feeding on the very flesh they sought to defend. And so the workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and despair, were left to suffer, their lives a mere abstraction, a mere commodity to be bought and sold. \"A population,\" Sinclair writes, \"low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" The parallels are stark, the echoes of a dark and troubled past, a cautionary tale of the horrors that lie in wait when humanity is reduced to its basest impulses.",
            "The canvas of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is threaded with a tapestry of meanings, woven from the very fabric of language itself. He employs a multitude of techniques to coax a particular hue from his readers, to conjure an aura that clings to the page like the mist that veils the valley of ashes. Fitzgerald's palette is broad, his brushstrokes bold, as he pairs unlikely companions - an adjective and a noun - to conjure an essence that clings to the reader like the sweat on a summer's day. The colors of his world are imbued with significance, each one a key that unlocks a door to a realm of meaning.\n\nWhite and gray, those twin siblings of the mundane, are Fitzgerald's instruments of choice. He coaxes from them a meaning that is at once both familiar and distant, like the whispered secrets of a summer breeze. In the beginning of the novel, the whiteness is that of the newlyweds, Daisy and Jordan, their faces alabaster, their skin powdered and pale as the driven snow. And Tom, the old-money aristocrat, wears his white shirt like a badge of honor, a symbol of the class that he so desperately seeks to preserve. Even Nick, the outsider, is drawn into this world of white, his flannels crisp and clean as the driven snow.\n\nBut as the novel unfolds, Fitzgerald's palette darkens, the white giving way to a grayer, more muted hue. The world of the Valley of Ashes is a place of desolation, a wasteland of gray cars and gray land, where the once-white dreams of the American Dream have withered and died. And Daisy, that elusive creature, is reduced to a mere cipher, a uniform of white, a dress that conceals the emptiness within. Her whiteness is now a reminder of the uniformity that lies at the heart of the American experience, a world where the individual is lost in the crowd, a faceless, nameless, forgotten soul.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is a masterclass in the art of suggestion, a reminder that meaning is not always what it seems. The colors of his world are a reflection of the human condition, a world where the lines between reality and illusion are blurred, where the past and present coexist in a world of gray. And it is in this world of gray, this world of uniformity, that we find the true meaning of The Great Gatsby, a novel that is at once both a critique of the American Dream and a paean to its enduring power.",
            "The arid landscape of San Diego County lay barren and unforgiving, yet it was here that the land yielded its secrets to the gentle touch of human toil. A mild and sun-scorched climate coaxed forth a bounty of crops, each one a testament to the unfettered will of nature: the plump, crimson tomatoes, the verdant citrus, the leafy greens that sprouted like verdant fingers, the squash and broccoli that burst forth in shimmering profusion. And the trees, those stalwart sentinels of the land, stood watch over the berries, peaches, and lemons, their fruit a sweet and generous gift. The air was heavy with the scent of honey, a golden nectar that seemed to seep from the earth itself, and the peppers, those fiery guardians of the land, stood watch over all.\n\nThe market for organic produce was a siren's call, beckoning those who would listen to the rhythms of the land. The waiting lists for community-supported agriculture programs were long and winding, a testament to the allure of a life untainted by the harsh chemicals that had desecrated so much of the world. And the eggs and milk, those simple, wholesome staples, were sought after by those who craved the purity of the land.\n\nBut the lure of the land was not without its costs. The organic farmer labored under a harder yoke, his sweat and toil a necessary price for the bounty he sought to reap. The pests and weeds that infested the land demanded constant vigilance, their presence a reminder of the delicate balance that governed this world. And the soil, that rich and fertile cradle of life, required a gentle hand, a careful touch that would coax forth its secrets without despoiling its depths.\n\nYet, it was in this desolate yet fecund landscape that the landowner found a chance to redeem the land, to restore it to its former glory. The parcel of land, a 160-acre expanse of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, lay adjacent to the town of Potrero, a town that had grown up around the Cleveland National Forest. And it was here, in this fragile ecosystem, that the landowner might find a way to balance the books, to coax forth a profit from the land without desecrating its beauty.\n\nThe land had a history, a tale of untold centuries, of Native Americans who had walked these hills, their footsteps silent on the wind. And then, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers had come, their presence a scar on the land, a reminder of the human touch that had shaped this world. The original homestead patent had brought forth a new era, one of grazing and wood production, a cycle that had repeated itself for generations.\n\nIn my research, I had stumbled upon a real estate listing, a piece of property that seemed to whisper its secrets to me, a small farmer seeking to eke out a living in this unforgiving yet fecund land. I had scoured the government programs, searching for a way to mitigate the costs, to preserve the wildlife-friendly operations that would allow the land to flourish. And it was in this quest that I had found an organic farm in the same area, a model of what might be achieved, a testament to the power of the human spirit in this arid yet verdant landscape.",
            "Culture is a labyrinth, its contours ever-shifting, its outlines blurred by the shadows of what it is not. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what it signifies, of what it stands for, and what it has become. The notion of a singular, homogeneous culture is a myth, a mirage that vanishes upon closer inspection. The assertions that \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are little more than a whispered rumor, a faint echo of a truth that has been distorted by the passage of time. Yet, it is precisely these generalizations that lead us astray, that distract us from the subtle nuances that govern a culture's behavior in the crucible of negotiation.\n\nTo navigate the treacherous waters of cultural understanding, one must first learn to listen to the whispers of history, to the prejudices that have shaped the contours of a culture's soul. This is not a matter of judging or condoning, but of accepting the culture for what it is, of acknowledging its boundaries, its limitations. For the negotiator, this is a matter of paramount importance, especially when the playing field is uneven, when the stakes are high and the position is weak. In such circumstances, a deep respect for the traditions and beliefs of the opposing culture can be a lifeline, a thread that weaves its way through the darkness, guiding us forward, one tentative step at a time.\n\nBut culture is not a monolith, a single entity that can be reduced to a national or international dichotomy. It is a hydra, a many-headed beast that adapts, evolves, and mutates in response to its environment. Within the confines of a nation, a corporation can cultivate its own culture, a unique and intricate web of values, customs, and practices that set it apart from its peers. This corporate culture can be seen in the dress codes that govern the workplace, in the communication styles that flow like a river through its halls, in the hiring practices that seek out the best and brightest. Some companies are temples of industry, where long hours are a badge of honor, while others are sanctuaries of relaxation, where the boundaries between work and play are blurred. And within these companies, there are subcultures, hidden worlds that pulsate with their own rhythms, their own values.\n\nBut it is not just the external trappings of culture that are important; it is the values that lie at its core. These are the unseen forces that shape behavior, that govern the ways in which individuals interact with one another. If a culture values saving face above all else, a negotiator will be reluctant to engage in public displays of conflict, lest they bring shame upon themselves and their organization. If a culture values the pursuit of a hard-driven bargain above all else, a negotiator will be willing to push the limits of what is acceptable, to test the mettle of their opponent, to see who will blink first. And it is precisely this understanding of values that is essential to successful negotiation, for it is the unseen currents that flow beneath the surface of culture that can either make or break an agreement.\n\nTo navigate these currents, a negotiator must be willing to listen, to observe, and to learn. They must seek to understand their opponent on a personal level, to grasp the subtleties of their motivations, their fears, and their desires. For it is not the surface-level understanding of culture that will serve them well, but the deep understanding that comes from empathy, from a willingness to see the world through the eyes of another. This is the key to effective negotiation, the thread that weaves its way through the labyrinth of culture, leading us forward, one step at a time.",
            "The darkness whispers in the hearts of men, a voice that dares to declare the unutterable: \"There is no God.\" This is the cry that echoes through the ages, a refrain taken from the ancient texts of the Christian Bible, specifically the Psalm of the 14th verse. It is a notion that finds its echo in the work of Thomas Aquinas, a philosopher who sought to anchor the existence of the divine in the bedrock of reason. And yet, we find ourselves standing at the crossroads, tasked with comparing the arguments of two men, both champions of the same creed, to determine which one shines brighter in the light of truth.\n\nTo navigate this labyrinth, we must first concede the impossible – that both Anselm and Aquinas speak truth, their voices harmonizing in a hymn of praise to the same God. To posit a deity of ambiguous form would be to render their arguments sterile, mere exercise in futility. And so, we shall begin with the assumption that their God is the God of the Bible, a being of defined presence and purpose.\n\nAs we delve into the heart of Anselm's argument, we find a path that winds through the recesses of the human soul. He posits that God's existence is not a externality, something to be discovered in the world without, but rather an internality, a truth that resides within the very fabric of our being. The mind, that great instrument of comprehension, is the key to unlocking the puzzle of the divine. We are not required to venture forth into the wilderness of empirical evidence to find proof of God's existence; rather, the evidence lies within, a flame that flickers in the darkness, awaiting recognition. This is the essence of faith – a conviction that transcends the mundane, a leap of trust into the unknown.\n\nBut Aquinas journeys a different path, one that seeks to anchor the existence of God in the certainties of reason. His is an endeavor to prove the divine through the crucible of logic, to distill the essence of God from the alembic of empirical evidence. The proof, in his view, lies not in the whispers of the heart, but in the cold, unforgiving light of reason. He marshals five mighty arguments to his cause: the proof of change, the necessity of causation, the contingency of being, the gradations of excellence, and the harmony of the universe. In each, he demonstrates that the existence of God is not a mystery, but a necessity, a logical consequence of the very fabric of reality.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves standing at the crossroads, the arguments of these two great thinkers laid before us like a puzzle, each piece carefully crafted, each one a testament to the power of the human mind. Which one shall we choose? Shall we follow Anselm's path, a journey through the labyrinth of the soul, or shall we follow Aquinas, a path of reason and empirical evidence? The choice, like the existence of God, remains a mystery, waiting to be revealed in the depths of our own hearts.",
            "In a time long past, a prince would arise, a man who would come to be known as the Buddha. His footsteps would lead him down a path of renunciation, a path that would ultimately deliver him into the depths of enlightenment. And it was from this enlightenment that the seeds of Buddhism would be sown, a seed that would germinate into a vast and labyrinthine tree, its branches stretching forth across the centuries like skeletal fingers. It is a tree that now stands as the most orthodox of its kind, known as Theravada Buddhism. Twenty five hundred years have transpired since the Buddha's time, and the world has changed. Yet the echoes of that distant era still linger, like the whispers of a forgotten wind. In the land of Sri Lanka, a nation born of Theravada, the water-cutting ceremony takes place each year. Monks and laymen alike converge upon this spectacle, a ritual that holds significance, though one that the Buddha himself never spoke of. The fissures that have developed between the church and the world are manifold, a chasm that yawns wide between the superficial trappings of tradition and the soteriological core of the faith.\n\nThroughout the annals of time, the Theravada Buddhist community has been subject to the vicissitudes of internal and external forces. The former, a force born of the community itself, is a force both benign and malignant. The latter, an external force, is any influence that comes from without. It is this duality that will be a recurring theme throughout this discussion.\n\nAs we delve into the heart of Theravada, we find ourselves confronted with a rich tapestry of doctrine. The triple gem, the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, serves as the foundation upon which the entire edifice of the faith is built. The Dhamma, a vast and sprawling entity, comprises the Tripitaka, that most ancient and revered of texts. The Tripitaka is divided into three baskets, each one a repository of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, those sacred utterances of the Buddha himself. The Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, a code of conduct that guides the lives of both monk and layman. And the Abhidhamma Pitaka, that most obscure and esoteric of texts, contains the metaphysical musings of the faith. Here, the concepts of Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca hold sway. Anatta, the notion that the self is but a fleeting illusion; Dukkha, the inherent suffering that pervades all existence; and Anicca, the impermanence that governs all things. It is only through the recognition of these truths that one may transcend the cycle of death and rebirth, that great wheel of suffering known as Sansara. And with Sansara's demise, the three great pitfalls that beset humanity – lobha, dosa, and moha – will also be vanquished. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth a code of conduct for the layman, five simple yet profound precepts that guide his actions. For the monk, the rules are many and complex, a labyrinthine path that must be navigated with precision. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths, a quartet of unyielding principles that serve as the bedrock of the faith. First, the truth of Dukkha, the recognition that life is but a river of suffering. Second, the truth that attachment is the source of suffering. Third, the truth that suffering may be overcome.",
            "In the arid expanse of the North American continent, two nations lay bound by a tenuous thread of animosity that stretched across nearly six decades, from the parched earth of 1836 to the cusp of the twentieth century's first great conflagration in 1893. This was the United States and Mexico, two lands beset by a rivalry that ebbed and flowed like the Rio Grande, its source and terminus forever tied to the unyielding tides of history. The calamitous war of 1846-1848 stood as a watershed moment, a high-water mark that saw the United States lay claim to the spoils of Texas and the Southwest, leaving in its wake a scar that would never fully heal.\n\nAs the years marched on, the enmity between the two nations only deepened, fueled by the primal fires of conflicting interests and the unyielding convictions of a people. It was a struggle born of the crucible of history, forged in the fire of clashing cultures and the unyielding passions of a bygone era. The spectral presence of the past loomed large, a testament to the indelible mark left by the Spanish and English empires that had once ruled over these twin nations. The distrust that had been sown in those distant days would prove a fertile ground for the rivalries that would follow, a legacy that would shape the destiny of these two lands for generations to come.\n\nThe United States and Mexico were not alone in their struggle. Across the globe, nations born of shared borders and conflicting interests had long been locked in a dance of rivalry, their steps choreographed by the ancient rhythms of history. Yet, the particular flavor of this enmity was unique, a complex brew of ideological and material differences that would prove a potent elixir for the animosity that simmered between these two nations. As David M. Pletcher so astutely observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" – a truth that would be borne out by the tortuous path of relations between the United States and its southern neighbor.\n\nAt its core, the rivalry between the two nations was a struggle born of faith, a clash of incompatible visions for the future that would prove as intractable as the mountains that separated them. Sally Frahm noted that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Americans had been driven by a fervent opposition to Catholicism and monarchy, a dichotomy that would find its mirror image in the Mexican people's own unyielding devotion to the Catholic faith. This fundamental difference would prove a chasm that would be bridged only by the patient efforts of those willing to navigate the treacherous waters of diplomacy.\n\nOver the course of its 57-year tenure, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico would leave in its wake a trail of disputes that would number seventeen, a litany of border raids, territorial squabbles, and frontier conflicts that would leave the very fabric of their relationship frayed and worn. The specter of bandits and outlaws, those shadowy figures that had long haunted the borders of both nations, would prove a constant thorn in the side of those seeking to establish a lasting peace. It was only when the United States and Mexico came to recognize the futility of their endless struggle that the tide of history began to turn, as Mexico's dependence on the United States grew and American ambitions shifted from the pursuit of territorial expansion to the quiet calculus of economic intervention.",
            "Fifteen years ago, the darkness crept in, an uninvited guest that stole the breath from my lungs and left me crippled, a stranger in my own skin. I was a nurse then, a guardian of the sick and the frail, a keeper of secrets and a witness to the fragility of life. The fire that once drove me, a flame of purpose and ambition, had been reduced to a smoldering ember, a reminder of what could never be again.\n\nThe words of a well-meaning stranger lingered in my mind, a mantra repeated like a dirge: \"You'll always find work, for there will always be those who fall ill.\" And so I chose nursing, a profession born of necessity, a way to silence the gnawing doubts that haunted me since childhood. But the dreams I had, the scientist, the journalist, they were reduced to ashes, the embers of a fire that had been extinguished.\n\nFifteen years have passed, and I am still a shadow of my former self, a specter haunting the fringes of society, dependent on the charity of others for survival. The days blend together, a never-ending expanse of tedium and despair, a constant reminder that I am but a fragile, temporal thing. And yet, in the midst of this desolate landscape, there is one truth that I hold onto, a beacon of hope in a world that seems determined to extinguish it: I am not alone.\n\nIt is a lesson that has been driven home by the kindness of family and friends, the unwavering support of those who refused to abandon me in my darkest hour. And I know that I am not exceptional in this, for it is in the face of disaster that we discover our true strength, our capacity for compassion and resilience.\n\nWe are fond of speaking of rugged individualism, of the pioneers who braved the unknown, who forged a new path in the wilderness. But let us not forget that it was not the lone wolf that survived, but the communities that banded together, that shared what little they had, that offered a helping hand in the face of the unknown. We would do well to remember this, to recognize that it is not in our individual strength that we find true security, but in the bonds that tie us together.\n\nI have prepared for the worst, stocked my pantry with canned goods, my cupboard with candles and matches, my mind with the knowledge of how to survive in a world gone mad. But I have also learned that true preparedness lies not in the things we possess, but in the relationships we cultivate, the connections we make with those around us. For it is in the face of disaster that we discover our true character, our capacity for compassion, for kindness, for forgiveness.\n\nGet to know your neighbors, for it is in their eyes that you will find a glimmer of hope, a reflection of the humanity that binds us all together. Do not wait until the darkness descends, until the storm rages, to reach out, to seek help, to offer aid. For it is in the quiet moments, in the stillness of the day, that we find the strength to face the unknown, to stand together against the tempests that will inevitably come.",
            "The labyrinthine paths of evolution, a mystery that has confounded the most erudite of scholars since the dawn of time. D'Arcy Thompson, a man of vision and sage insight, spoke these words in 1917: \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" And so it remains, a truth we find ourselves entwined in, even as we strive to unravel the tangled threads of change within the mollusk's skeletogenesis.\n\nOur study, a foray into the uncharted territories of Prunum, seeks to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We have employed mathematical modeling, a tool of precision and elegance, to chart the ontogenetic and phylogenetic transformations of this enigmatic creature. X-radiographic images of Prunum species have been scrutinized, yielding quantitative parameters that have been fed into the software program CerioShell, a digital realm where hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies converge.\n\nWithin this virtual expanse, we have crafted a topology of possible shell forms, a map of the boundaries that contain the morphological potential of Prunum. These cartographies are being woven together with experimental and descriptive studies, an intricate tapestry that seeks to illuminate the macroevolutionary events that have shaped this clade.\n\nA shell, that most wondrous and intricate of structures, is a spiral of space and time, a tube that unwinds through 360 degrees of existence. The whorls, those concentric coils, spiral around an axis, a columella that runs through the central column of the shell like a thread through a needle. The speed of these whorls' growth can fluctuate, creating a suture, a line that separates each coil like the crease on a worn leather glove. The body whorl, the final coil, stands as the largest, a sentinel that guards the vulnerable aperture.\n\nThe spire, a series of whorls that precede the body whorl, rises like a shard of light from the darkness. The apex, the tip of this spire, pierces the sky, while the base, the opposite extremity, sinks into the earth. And from this opening, the mollusk emerges, a creature of mystery and beauty.\n\nThe shell, a testament to the ingenuity of its creator, can be viewed from four quadrants: the apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The apertural view, a vista that frames the aperture, is the most common, a perspective that reveals the shell in all its glory.\n\nTo count the whorls, one must gaze upon the shell from the apical view, where the first suture begins its journey. A line, a divider, separates the shell into two parts, and the whorls are counted, estimated to a quarter of a turn. The aperture, that vulnerable opening, can be traced through time and space, its path a trajectory of growth and change.\n\nThis trajectory, a mathematical formulation, can be represented graphically, a dance of lines and curves that capture the essence of the mollusk's skeletogenesis. And once this formulation is crafted, the parameters can be varied, and the mollusk's growth can be modified, a world of possibilities unfolding like a lotus flower in the sun.",
            "The shadows of mortality hung over the cradles of Indonesia, a specter that refused to be vanquished. For a decade, the numbers had held steady, a grim testament to the unyielding grip of disease and despair. The promise of the Millennium Development Goals, like beacons in the darkness, beckoned to this forsaken land, but the progress was slow, a mere trickle in the face of unyielding need. The targets loomed ahead, a distant mirage on the horizon, as the country struggled to find its footing in the treacherous terrain of child and maternal health.\n\nIn the midst of this desolate landscape, a glimmer of hope flickered to life. The attendance of skilled health workers at births had increased, a modest gain of 72% in a land where tradition and superstition still held sway. Yet, this meager triumph was tainted by the knowledge that many of these birth attendants were but midwives, unversed in the dark arts of medicine, powerless against the crushing forces of hemorrhage that cut short the lives of so many mothers.\n\nThe numbers told a tale of unfulfilled promise. Diarrheal cases in children under five had declined, yet the treatment of these afflictions by health professionals had begun to stagnate, a testament to the feeble state of Indonesia's healthcare infrastructure. The shadows of postnatal care hung over the land, a void that yawned wide, unlit and unforgiving.\n\nThe cesarean section rate, a statistic that hung like a guillotine over the lives of countless women, stood at a paltry 4%, a number that spoke volumes about the limited access to healthcare in this forsaken land. And yet, it was not a uniform rate, a grim reminder of the yawning chasm between the haves and the have-nots. In the cities, the rate stood at 7%, a gaudy display of privilege, while in the rural areas, it teetered at a mere 2%, a stark testament to the cruel indifference of fate.\n\nThe vertical equity gap yawned wide, a chasm that separated the poor from the rich, a gulf that seemed insurmountable. The numbers spoke of a 27% disparity in service utilization, a cruel reminder that access to healthcare was a privilege reserved for the few, a luxury that the many could only dream of. The out-of-pocket costs, a heavy burden that weighed upon the shoulders of the poor, a weight that threatened to crush them beneath its unyielding pressure.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the land in a dark and foreboding shadow, the question hung in the air, a question that seemed to taunt and tease. How to bridge the chasm, to close the yawning void that gaped between the haves and the have-nots? Should Indonesia turn to the siren song of program-specific approaches, a panacea that promised quick fixes and easy answers, or should it instead strengthen the frail and faltering health system, a system that seemed to be on the brink of collapse?\n\nThe allure of vertical approaches, with their targeted objectives and manageable outcomes, was strong, a seductive siren's call that beckoned to the weary and the worn. Yet, the drawbacks were clear, a warning sign that screamed of the dangers of a myopic focus. The diversion of resources, the siphoning off of funds and personnel, the duplication of services, and the paperwork, a tangled web of bureaucracy that threatened to strangle the very life from the system.\n\nIn the end, it was a choice between a quick fix and a long-term solution, between a band-aid and a cure. The fate of Indonesia's children and mothers hung in the balance, a fragile thread that seemed to tremble in the wind, a thread that threatened to snap at any moment, plunging the land into an abyss of despair.",
            "In the labyrinthine world of Victorian fiction, a peculiarity exists where two novels dare to diverge from the conventions of their time. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, two works often regarded as outliers, weave a tapestry of mystery and the unknown. These aberrations from the norm imbue their characters with an aura of enigma, allowing the reader to glimpse the hidden recesses of their psyche, where motives and emotions reside.\n\nAs the darkness closed in around Oliver Twist, a maelstrom of confusion swept through his mind. The echoes of Sikes and Crackit's contentious voices still lingered, their words seared into his memory like a branding iron. And then, without warning, the sound of gunfire shattered the air, a cacophony of chaos that lifted him up and bore him away. In the tumult, a searing pain gnawed at his consciousness, an undefined ache that refused to subside.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dreamlike sequences serve as a window into the protagonist's tortured soul. The shooting that nearly claimed his life is revisited in a vivid, nightmarish recollection, where the lines between reality and fantasy blur. As he searches for respite, Oliver's senses are numbed, his body a vessel for the unseen forces that propelled him through the streets. The pain, once a shock, had become a constant companion, its grip tightening with every passing moment. In this state of abject despair, the question lingers: whose hand had guided Oliver's fate, for it was certainly not his own? The shooting serves as a potent reminder of his powerlessness, a growing sense of defeat that had been sown by the relentless drumbeat of Fagin's cruelty.\n\nThe day passed, a fleeting whisper of existence, a moment's pause between the darkness that preceded and the darkness that followed. Night descended, a shroud that wrapped around the world, its silence oppressive, its brevity a cruel mockery. The hours ticked by, each one a slow march towards the abyss, as the shadows deepened and the silence grew.",
            "In the brutal light of a bygone afternoon, I recall a boy named Adrian, his small form huddled over a primer, his eyes cast down upon the page as if searching for some hidden truth. I had been tasked with his tutelage, guiding him through the labyrinthine passages of English, a language that for him was as foreign as the stars that shone in the desert night. His struggles were peculiar, a jarring discord that echoed through the halls of the after-school program. Some letters danced upon his tongue with ease, while others recoiled in terror, their pronunciation a cacophony that rent the air. His mother, a woman of unyielding resolve, walked in upon me, her eyes flashing with a language I could not understand, a tongue that was alien to my ears. Our halting conversation was a dance of gestures and fumbling words, a fragile thread that bound us together.\n\nAnd then, like a revelation from the heavens, it struck me: Adrian's reading troubles lay not in comprehension, but in the very alphabet itself. The English language, a behemoth that towered over him like a colossus, seemed to mock his every attempt. I fear that my feeble efforts did little to aid him, but I hope that he has since found solace in the written word.\n\nI speak of this tale to highlight the insidious presence of the language barrier, a specter that haunts the halls of learning, particularly in the sun-kissed lands of California. It is a problem that masquerades as a straightforward issue, but in reality, it is a Gordian knot that defies easy solution. Even the most fluent of speakers can find themselves lost in the labyrinth of the written word. I propose that we abandon the simplistic thinking that has thus far dominated our approach. Tutoring, immersion, ESL classes, and bilingual programs are all piecemeal solutions, a patchwork quilt that fails to address the underlying issue.\n\nThe dual language system, a notion that has been shunned by some as a frivolous indulgence, holds the key to unlocking the doors of understanding. Research has shown that children who participate in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers, their academic prowess a testament to the power of language. The fear that surrounds this idea – that it is a waste of resources, a luxury that only a select few can afford – is nothing but a myth. If we were to adopt this approach as the norm, rather than the exception, the benefits would be felt by all. But how do we accomplish this? Do we require our teachers to be bilingual, a demand that is both unreasonable and unrealistic? No, I propose that we provide them with the tools they need, bilingual assistants, tutors, and aids who can bridge the gap between languages.",
            "In the earliest hours of our existence, a whispered truth has been imparted upon us: that there exists a presence beyond our mortal grasp, a thing that defies comprehension. The devout seek answers in hushed tones within the confines of temple or pulpit, while others search within the labyrinthine corridors of their own minds. Many cling to the creeds bequeathed to them by their forebears, yet others reject them outright, convinced that the universe is a singular, self-contained entity. And so we wander, each of us forging our own path in the pursuit of spiritual understanding, driven by an unquenchable thirst for meaning in a world shrouded in darkness.\n\nAs I recall, my father's gaze would often drift out into the void, his eyes a window to the depths of his soul. It was a look that spoke of remembrance and longing, a look that seemed to both seek and eschew connection. The rain pounded against the tin roof above us, a relentless drumbeat that underscored the weight of our silence. We sat on the creaking porch, the air thick with the acrid smoke of our cigarettes, the gutters spilling forth a deluge that drowned the parched earth. His frame had grown gaunt, his skin sallow, his hair thinned to a sparse veil. He stared out into the rain, avoiding my gaze, and I felt a hollow sense of desolation, a feeling that our words would only serve to make the ache more palpable. So I reached out, wrapped my arms around him, and drew closer, our eyes fixed on the rain-soaked world beyond.\n\nIt was December when he finally succumbed, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, buying time that neither he nor I could fully grasp. And as I lay in the darkness, I found myself questioning the benevolence of a deity who could ordain such a fate. The shadows closed in around me, and I whispered no prayers, for if a god existed, I believed it had long since turned a deaf ear to my pleas. \n\nI had not wished to bear witness to his passing, to watch as the spark that animated him flickered out. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he had become. I knew him better than they did, better than his kin, and I knew that he would not have wanted me to be a spectator to his final moments. I retreated into myself, curled into a ball, and waited for the news that would shatter the fragile silence. But even that comfort was denied me, for no one came to break the stillness.\n\nThe darkness lingered, a heavy blanket that suffocated me, as I waited.",
            "In the crepuscular twilight of literary history, the Gothic novel emerges, a paradoxical union of the antique and the modern. This oxymoronic marriage, as Ian Watt so astutely observed, gives rise to a genre both bereft and beguiling. The Gothic mode has been reviled, extolled, and reviled once more, accused of being a shallow masquerade, yet lauded for its capacity to evoke the \"terrible sublime.\" The foundational text, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, serves as a crucible, fusing the residues of medieval romances and the nascent stirrings of the modern novel. Walpole's Gothic narrative, a deliberate amalgam of \"old\" theatrical conceits and \"new\" narrative innovations, yields a singular beast, a \"Gothic Story\" that defies categorization.\n\nIn the fluid, protean realm of the Gothic, the boundaries between past and present, high and low, blur and dissolve. The genre's roots lie in the decaying, gothicized architecture of medieval theatre, its traditions and tropes endlessly revisited and reinterpreted. The word \"gothic,\" a term once freighted with associations of archaism and unsophistication, had long been employed to describe various peoples, styles, and epochs. Yet, it was precisely this syncretic quality, this willingness to blend and blur, that allowed the Gothic to endure, to become both anachronistic and perennially relevant to readers situated in disparate temporalities.\n\nChivalry, that vaunted ideal of the medieval knight, holds a significant place within the Gothic canon. Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a text born of turmoil and disillusionment, idealizes and romanticizes the chivalric code, that mirage of honor, bravery, and competence. Through its deployment of chivalric motifs and manners, the Gothic past is reimagined as a lost Eden, a golden age of moral certainties and unblemished virtue. This nostalgic impulse, a yearning for a bygone era, serves as a counterpoint to the perceived decay and corruption of the present. In Walpole's writing, the character of Frederic embodies this chivalric ideal, his description replete with traditional epicurean flourishes: a prince, a sufferer, a wanderer, and a martyr, his very existence a testament to the allure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight.\" The excesses of his character, a deliberate exaggeration of the chivalric type, introduce the Gothic trope of the excessive, a note that would resound throughout the genre.",
            "In the hardscrabble expanse of commerce, a labyrinthine process unfolds, a serpentine path of goods from the primal sources of raw materials to the anxious hands of the customer. This is the supply chain, a ceaseless dance of production, supply, and distribution, a grand ballet of movement and purpose. The term supply chain management, a concept forged in the crucible of modern industry, owes its existence to the keen insight of Keith Oliver, a sage counselor to the captains of commerce. In 1982, Oliver illuminated the contours of this intricate process, a harmonious marriage of planning, implementation, and control, all aimed at satisfying the capricious whims of the customer in a world where time is a luxury.\n\nSix elemental pillars support this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The masters of the corporate realm utilize these foundations to construct a bulwark of customer satisfaction, a fortress of service that rises above the din of competition. But at the heart of this grand endeavor lies production, the inaugural step in the supply chain's gestation. Here, the when, why, where, and how of creation are coaxed into being, a delicate waltz of planning and execution. The managers' first task is to divine the desires of the customer, to listen to the whispers of the market, that capricious mistress who holds the keys to the kingdom of demand.\n\nThe market, a vast and unforgiving expanse, holds the secrets of the customer's heart, and it is here that the managers must seek guidance. Once the market's intentions are deciphered, the managers can proceed to shape the contours of production, deciding what products shall be created, in what quantities, and where they shall be forged. The location of production, a critical juncture in the supply chain's trajectory, must balance the competing demands of volume and quality, a tightrope walk of logistics and strategy. And so, the managers toil, their every decision a calculated gamble in the high-stakes game of commerce.\n\nThe scheduling of workloads, the maintenance of equipment, and the precise calibration of production all conspire to create a symphony of efficiency, a finely tuned machine that can withstand the vicissitudes of the market. For in the world of supply chain management, every detail is a vital thread in the intricate tapestry of success. A misstep, a miscalculation, can have far-reaching consequences, a ripple effect that can cost a company dearly in the long run.\n\nConsider, if you will, the retail behemoths of Wal-Mart and Target, those titans of the corporate world, whose every move is a calculated exercise in precision. Their systems, a labyrinthine network of processes and protocols, a finely honed instrument of commerce, allow them to navigate the treacherous waters of supply chain management with ease. The employee's uniform, a symbol of corporate identity, is but one small part of this grand design, a testament to the power of planning and anticipation.\n\nSupply, the second pillar of the supply chain, is a realm of strategic decision-making, a high-stakes game of chess where the pawns are facilities and partnerships. A company's core capabilities, its very identity, are forged in the crucible of supply, where the manager must decide which divisions of production are best suited to the task at hand. And when the decision is made to outsource, to partner with other companies, the aim is clear: to create velocity, to achieve that elusive balance of quality, flexibility, and cost. For in the world of supply chain management, velocity is the holy grail, the unattainable goal that drives the company forward, ever onward, into the unknown.",
            "A weathered cardboard sign creaked in the wind, its message scrawled in hasty, black letters: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". Ellen Page, a fragile figure, stood alone on a cracked sidewalk, her eyes cast downward as if in supplication. The words on the sign seemed to mock her, a cruel jest in a land where the tyrannical grasp of the junta held sway. Burma, a nation shrouded in the shadows of despotism, had known no other rule since the coup of '62. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting moment of defiance, had kindled in the hearts of its people, but the flames of hope were soon extinguished by the brutal hand of the military.\n\nMonks, their saffron robes a stark contrast to the darkness that enveloped them, had marched into the streets, only to be met with violence and bloodshed. The bodies of the fallen littered the streets, their numbers lost in the abyss of official silence. A Japanese journalist, Kenji Nagai, had paid the ultimate price for bearing witness to the atrocities, his death a grim reminder of the junta's unyielding grip on power.\n\nSuch is the lot of humanity, forever bound to the whims of those who would seek to control and oppress. The desire for absolute rule is an ancient curse, one that has infected the hearts of men since the dawn of civilization. The Roman emperors, gods in their own minds, had claimed dominion over their subjects, while the Japanese emperors were believed to be divine, guiding their people through the darkness of history. And in our own time, the echoes of this madness persist, a chilling refrain that has become all too familiar.\n\nThe ghosts of Tiananmen Square, where protesters had dared to challenge the all-powerful Chinese regime, still lingered, their numbers lost in the void of official reportage. The Rwandan genocide, a systematic slaughter of the innocent, had left an indelible stain on the collective conscience. And the Third Reich, that abomination of Nazi Germany, had shown the world the unspeakable horrors that men could inflict upon one another in the name of power and supremacy.\n\nIn this, our world remains unchanged, a realm of darkness and despair, where the strong prey upon the weak and the voices of the oppressed are drowned out by the cacophony of oppression. The sign on Ellen Page's cardboard, a bleak and haunting reminder of the abyss that yawns before us, serves as a testament to the enduring legacy of humanity's capacity for cruelty and despair.",
            "In the vast expanse of Duke Ellington's legacy, his longevity stands as a testament to the boundless creative fires that burned within him. As a maestro, he wove a tapestry of sound that was at once both intricate and sublime, his pianist's touch a subtle undercurrent that coursed through the very fabric of his compositions. In those selected for this assignment, Ellington's presence on the piano is a whispered promise, a gentle reminder of the masterful hand that guided the orchestra's trajectory.\n\nYet it is in his role as composer that Ellington's true genius shines forth, a rich tapestry of sound that showcased the individual threads of his band members. He crafted the framework for soloists to unfurl their improvisational wings, to soar on the thermals of his carefully orchestrated phrases. The result was a music that danced with the particular style of each player, a symphony of sounds that coalesced into a coherent and original whole.\n\nIn the early work Creole Love Call, Ellington revealed a prophetic vision of the voice as a jazz instrument, a lyre that sang with the raw emotion of the human heart. This bluesy dirge, with its deliberate twelve bars, demonstrated a prescience that would become a hallmark of his career – the ability to complement the unique timbre of his soloists, to coax from them a music that was at once both personal and universal. The piece unfolds in six choruses, each a chapter in the narrative of sound:\n\nThe first chorus, a call and response between voice and reeds, begins with a smooth, melodic tone, only to give way to a rougher, more guttural sound. The second chorus, a muted trumpet solo, elaborates on the basic melody, its blue notes stretching out like a supplicant's plea.\n\nThe third chorus, a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, is backed by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase that is at once both propulsive and hesitant. The fourth chorus, a full-band reprise of the first, features a call and response between the brass and reed sections, a swirling vortex of sound that threatens to consume all in its path.\n\nThe fifth chorus, the climactic peak of the piece, sees the reeds take up the call, their high register piercing the air like a cry of despair. The brass and rhythm sections, in syncopated stop-time, add a rhythmic counterpoint that underscores the emotional intensity of the moment.\n\nThe final chorus returns to the structure of the first, the voice now adopting the growl technique, soloing as an instrument. The tag, a brief coda, features a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, a final, jarring note that hangs in the air like a challenge.\n\nIn this work, Ellington's use of voice as a dimension of tone color is but one example of a stylistic trait that would come to define his oeuvre. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, he would combine his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, coaxing a rich and complementary sound from the call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) would extend these ideas, as Ellington would use Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone, the sound a perfect distillation of the music's driving, irresistible energy.",
            "A gnawing void had long resided within her, a hollowness that defied satiation. It had taken root at the tender age of fourteen, when the world's vast expanse began to unfold before her. Three years had since elapsed, yet the ache persisted, refusing to be sated. Her desires, once fixated on material possessions, had shifted to a yearning for human connection, but none had managed to stir within her a spark of interest. The attentions of suitors had been a comical spectacle, their attempts to woo her a clumsy exercise in futility. She had often found herself lost in introspection, searching for a plausible explanation for this peculiarity, but the theories that arose only served to deepen the mystery.\n\nHer home was a sanctuary, a refuge from the tempests that raged outside. Her parents, tranquil souls, moved through life with an unshakeable calm, their disagreements a rarity. When they did occur, it was usually a result of her unbridled spirit, a force that threatened to upend the equilibrium of their serene existence. Yet, she was a kindred spirit, a paradox of contradictions that drew people to her like moths to flame.\n\nBut today, the stillness was shattered. As she wandered through the rooms, searching for inspiration, a cry pierced the air, followed by the faint murmur of her mother's voice. The kitchen, once a place of warmth and comfort, had become a scene of distress. Her mother lay on the floor, her eyes clouded with pain, her breaths staccato and labored. She rushed to her side, her own heart racing in tandem with her mother's distress. \"Mom... Mom, what's wrong?\" she exclaimed, her voice trembling with concern. Her mother's words tumbled forth in a rush, a jumbled mix of pain and urgency. \"Ow... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The daughter's hand instinctively grasped her mother's, offering what little comfort she could. \"Where can I pick you up, Mom?\" she asked, her voice steady despite the turmoil within. Her mother's directions were fragmented, but the daughter's training had prepared her for this moment. She lifted her mother with a strength born of desperation, her heart aching with every step. The drive to the hospital was a blur, her mind focused solely on her mother's needs.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic atmosphere only served to heighten the sense of unease, but she was oblivious to the fear that clung to her like a shroud. Her sole concern was her mother's well-being. She carried her to the examination room, her voice calling out to the doctors in a steady, urgent tone. The medical staff rushed to her side, their faces etched with concern. A rolling bed was summoned, and her mother was laid upon it, her daughter left to sit, her heart heavy with worry. The diagnosis was a simple one: her mother had fallen from a precarious perch, a stepping stool, while reaching for a vase.",
            "The sun-scorched land of morbidity stretched out before us, a barren expanse of heart disease and stroke that threatened to consume the lives of countless women.  Yet, like a beacon of hope in the desolate wasteland, the Mediterranean Diet stood tall, its virtues extolled by the dusty tomes of science.  The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a measure of adherence to this sacred creed, was found to be inversely linked to the specter of chronic heart disease and stroke, that twin demons that stalked the night, whispering the names of the fallen to the wind.\n\nThis study, a prosaic exercise in the pursuit of knowledge, sought to unravel the mysteries of the aMed diet, a modified variant of the Mediterranean Diet's sacred precepts.  By emphasizing the consumption of plant foods, those verdant denizens of the earth, and eschewing the unwholesome presence of saturated fats, those dark and malevolent forces that seek to destroy, the aMed diet promised a path to redemption.  The inclusion of fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, those pillars of a just diet, served as a bulwark against the ravages of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe ancients had spoken of the Mediterranean Diet's virtues, but this study sought to delve deeper, to pierce the veil of doubt and uncertainty that shrouded the darkness of stroke and stroke mortality.  Prior studies had hinted at the diet's efficacy in vanquishing the specter of cardiovascular mortality, but the silence was broken by the sound of the aMed diet's drumbeat, beating out a rhythm of hope in the hearts of the faithful.\n\nIn the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without the stain of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, a tale of endurance and survival was written.  For twenty years, they walked the path of the aMed diet, their footsteps measured by the self-reported food frequency questionnaires, those pages of parchment that held the secrets of their daily bread.  The validation of these reports, a ritual of fire and purification, was performed by the sacred texts of medical records and death certificates.\n\nYet, even as the darkness gathered, the women of this study stood firm, their resolve unwavering in the face of the void.  Their bodies, measured by the yardstick of body mass index, smoking status, and aspirin use, told a tale of resilience, of a people unbroken by the trials of the aMed diet.  As they walked the path of the diet, their cumulative averages of the aMed score, like the steady beat of a drum, measured out the rhythm of their progress.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a sacred arithmetic of risk and reward, revealed the hidden truths of the aMed diet.  And lo, the women who walked the path of the diet, those who heeded the call of the aMed score, were found to be at lower risk of heart disease and stroke, their footsteps measured by the relative risk quotient.  In the top quintile of the aMed score, a realm of plenty and abundance, the women stood, unbroken and unafraid, their hearts beating to the rhythm of a healthier life.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of the American experience, a calamity unfolded in the year 2007, a year that would come to be known as the nadir of a long descent into economic ruin. The economic behemoths of the nation crumbled beneath the weight of their own hubris, their colossus-like structures tumbling to the ground like the idols they had become. The people suffered, their livelihoods reduced to ashes, their futures incinerated by the very fires of speculation and greed that had fueled the engines of progress.\n\nThe rot that had taken hold ran deep, its roots tracing back to the year 1999, a time when the nation's leaders, blinded by their own ambition, had begun to tamper with the delicate machinery of the economy. The Clinton administration, driven by a hunger for power, had relaxed the reins of restraint, allowing the wolves of speculation to roam free. And so, Fannie Mae, that behemoth of the mortgage industry, was goaded into extending its reach, casting its net far and wide in search of the vulnerable and the gullible. The siren song of easy credit had begun to beckon, and the people, ensnared by the promise of a better life, had answered.\n\nThe warning signs had been there, visible to all who cared to see. In the pages of the New York Times, a prescient voice had sounded the alarm, cautioning against the dangers of a house of cards built on shifting sands. \"Fannie Mae,\" Steven Holmes had written, \"the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" And then, in a phrase that would prove to be a prophecy, he added, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nBut the warnings had fallen on deaf ears, and the economy careened forward, fueled by the toxic fumes of speculation and greed. The new and complex structures of mortgage-backed securities, CDOs, and adjustable-rate mortgages had created a Frankenstein's monster of finance, a creature that had lost all control, its fate sealed. The sectors of the economy had become intertwined, a vast and intricate web of debt and obligation, a house of cards that would soon come crashing down.\n\nAnd down it came, with a crash that shook the very foundations of the nation. The top five U.S. investment banks, once the titans of finance, were brought low, their losses totaling $4.1 trillion, a staggering sum that would leave the nation reeling. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those behemoths of the mortgage industry, stood at the precipice, their combined debt of $5 trillion a weight that threatened to consume them whole. And so, in September 2008, they were brought under government control, a desperate attempt to salvage what was left of the economy.",
            "In the desolate expanse of narrative, there exists a barren stretch known as exposition.  A place where the writer's wings, once poised to take flight, instead falter and wither in the arid air.  The reader, a traveler in this unforgiving land, stumbles upon a wasteland of words, where the magnetic pull of the writer's prose is lost to the void.  Dr. Merlin, a sage guide in this wilderness, is known to bemoan the fate of such passages, her voice rising in frustration as the words blur before her eyes.\n\nExposition, that insidious whisper in the writer's ear, tempts her to reveal the hidden truths, to lay bare the skeletal framework of the story.  But it is a siren's call, luring her down the rocky shores of prose, where the reader's interest founders and the narrative succumbs to the undertow of tedium.\n\nThe familiar mantra, \"Show, don't tell,\" echoes through the halls of writing wisdom, yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in the quagmire of exposition, her words a jumbled mass of information, a cacophony of fact and fiction.  The devil that sits upon her shoulder, urging her to reveal the backstory, the history of the characters' lives, is a constant companion, a shadow that haunts her every move.\n\nTo illustrate the folly of exposition, let us consider a tale of love and loss.  A heroine, her heart aflame with passion, meets her beloved in a moment of time, their love blossoming like a wildflower in the desert.  But their marriage is reduced to a few stilted lines, a cursory nod to the depth of their emotions.  The husband, a man whose love is as vast as the desert itself, is reduced to a mere specter, a fleeting presence in the heroine's life.  His murder, a brutal act that shatters the fragile bonds of their love, is met with a sparse display of emotion, the heroine's grief a mere whisper in the wind.\n\nThe proper rendering of this tale would be to give substance to the bare bones of the narrative.  To show, not tell, the depth of the heroine's emotions, the richness of her love for the husband.  To reveal, through the prism of her eyes, the world that she saw through his, the hopes and dreams that he instilled in her.  Only then, in the midst of this rich tapestry, can the reader truly mourn the loss of the husband, and in doing so, come to know the heroine in all her complexity.\n\nAs writers, we must strive to infuse the narrative with the meat of life, to make the simple storyline a testament to the human experience.  We must eschew the temptation to rush past the nuances of character, to reveal the hidden depths of their souls.  For in the end, it is not the exposition that matters, but the world that we create, the lives we touch, and the emotions we evoke.",
            "The evening sun had long since surrendered to the shadows as I sat transfixed before the glowing rectangle, the hum of the television a morbid serenade. The faces of two local newscasters leered back at me, their words a litany of the day's atrocities. From Columbus, Ohio, the news poured in like a relentless rain, each story a minor tremor in the ongoing earthquake of humanity's worst excesses.\n\nThe first report was a jerky, disjointed thing, a snippet of live broadcast from an earlier morning. A man, Shad Hostettler, his features twisted into a visage of malevolence, stared back at me from the screen. His wife, nameless and faceless, a mere prop in his dark design, had been the target of his madness, her body a canvas for his brutal art. The news anchor's voice droned on, a monotone litany of fact and speculation, before moving on to the next tale of woe.\n\nThe second story, a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, was a cold, clinical thing, devoid of passion or conviction. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, lay critically wounded, his fate a precarious balance of life and death. The authorities, a parade of uniforms and badges, marched in to investigate, their words a hollow promise of justice. But I knew, in that moment, that this story would be but a footnote in the grand tome of human suffering. The victims of a black neighborhood were often forgotten, their stories reduced to a mere whisper, a ghostly echo that faded into the ether.\n\nThe newscasters moved on, their words a blur of indifference, as they spoke of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. The bullet, a .22 caliber pellet from a rifle, had pierced the metal skin of the aircraft, a tiny, insignificant thing in the grand tapestry of the universe. And yet, a reward was offered, a paltry sum of five thousand dollars, a feeble attempt to salve the wound of a community's outrage.\n\nThe forecast, a meandering thing, spoke of rain and thunderstorms, a minor perturbation in the grand dance of the weather. The temperatures, a mere trifle, would remain in the mid-to-low eighties, a trivial concern in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAnd so the newscasters moved on, their words a litany of petty crimes and inconsequential events. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF, a store clerk's tale of a dark-skinned black man, his features a mere caricature, his crime a trivial thing in the grand ledger of humanity's sins. The words dripped with a subtle venom, a subtext that spoke of fear and prejudice, a whispered promise of a world where some lives were worth less than others.\n\nFinally, a convicted man, Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin, was paraded before the camera, his face a mask of defiance. His crime, a conspiracy to distribute marijuana, a trivial thing in the grand scheme of things. His sentence, a mere 300 months, a paltry sum in the face of humanity's vast and unforgiving landscape. And yet, his ethnicity, a Hispanic man, was trotted out, a tired trope, a worn and dusty phrase, a reminder that in this world, some lives were worth less than others.",
            "In the crucible of brotherhood, a bond is forged that cannot be broken, a bond that festers with the contradictions of love and cruelty, of pride and jealousy. It is a bond that allows brothers to see themselves in one another, to behold their own reflection staring back, unflinching and unyielding. And it is in the depths of desperation, when all hope seems lost, that this bond is revealed in all its twisted glory. The consequences of this bond are dire, a reckoning that is paid in full with every cruel thought and every tender gesture.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers embark on a futile journey, their bond tempered by the unforgiving forces of nature. The clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a fever pitch in a climactic moment of truth, leaving only one brother to escape the devastating consequences. Through the eyes of the narrator, we are granted a glimpse into the inner workings of the protagonist's fractured psyche, a world where the lines between love and hatred are blurred beyond recognition.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to the devouring power of pride. From the outset, his relationship with his brother Doodle is marked by resentment, a seething anger that festers in the face of the little boy's crippled form. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who would be his companion in every sense, a partner in adventure and a mirror to his own soul. But Doodle's fragile heart, a constant reminder of the cruel hand that fate had dealt him, was a bitter pill to swallow. The memories of their early days together, of the things they would never do, of the dreams that would never be realized, still lingered, a festering wound that refused to heal.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of this unyielding despair, a glimmer of hope flickered to life. The small boy's smile, a radiant beam of light in a world gone dark, pierced the protagonist's heart, a reminder of the love that lay hidden beneath the surface. It was a love that was not strong enough to conquer the crushing weight of his own desires, but it was enough to stay his hand, to prevent the unforgivable act of infanticide that had lurked in the shadows of his mind. In that moment, the protagonist saw the truth of his own nature, a truth that was both beautiful and brutal, a reflection of the bond that had forged him into the person he was.",
            "The human brain - a labyrinthine repository of circuitry and cognition, its workings as inscrutable as the dark recesses of the earth.  As the machinery of technology has advanced, so too have the metaphors we employ to grasp its essence.  We once conceived of the brain as a wax tablet, receiving impressions of the world like the soft, yielding surface of a page.  Later, it was likened to a papyrus scroll, unrolled and inscribed with the intricate hieroglyphics of thought.  And more recently, we have come to see it as a calculating device, a machine of cold efficiency, processing data with the speed and precision of a well-oiled automaton.  Yet these analogies, though clever, are ultimately feeble attempts to capture the fullness of its mystery.\n\nInformation, a constant influx of sensory impressions - the tactile caress of the sun on skin, the cacophony of sound that assaults the eardrums, the photons that dance across the retina - is transformed, transmuted by the brain's dark alchemy into a language of electrical signals that course through its tangled network like a river through the desert.  This machinery of perception is a double-edged sword, cutting both ways: on one hand, the bottom-up process, a slow and laborious assembly of the most basic components - color, shape, texture - into a coherent whole; on the other, the top-down process, a swift and intuitive leap, guided by the accumulated wisdom of past experiences, to a recognition that is both instantaneous and profound.\n\nBut even as the information is processed, an unseen hand, the attention filter, intervenes, deciding what is worthy of notice, what is to be set aside, and what is to be forgotten.  It is a gatekeeper, a sentinel that stands at the threshold of awareness, admitting only what is deemed necessary, rejecting the rest.  Thus, in the midst of a riotous din, we may pluck out the melody of our own name, a thread of meaning that stands out against the tapestry of dissonance.\n\nAnd yet, for all its seeming complexity, the brain's basic function - the storage of information - is a simple, yet profound one.  There are the three levels of memory: the sensory, a fleeting impression, a snapshot of the moment; the working, a delicate dance of electrical signals that shimmers and fades like a firefly in the night; and the long-term, a repository of knowledge, a library of the past, where the accumulated wisdom of centuries is inscribed upon the walls of the mind.\n\nThe models of how this knowledge is organized are legion, each one a reflection of our own imperfect understanding of the brain's labyrinthine depths.  Some are based on the human experience, a map of memories etched upon the surface of the mind; others, on the cold, unforgiving logic of computer science; and others, on the twitching, electrical impulses that course through the body.  And yet, no matter the model, the truth remains elusive, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons us deeper into the darkness, deeper into the heart of the human brain.",
            "In the desolate landscape of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley's scathing critique of the forthcoming specter of technology and the fetid underbelly of capitalism unfurls like a dark tapestry. This dystopian world, where the masses toil in servitude to the dictates of the World Controller, is a testament to the pernicious effects of a system that values conformity above the solitary flame of individuality. From the very inception, the inhabitants are indoctrinated with a numbing mantra of hedonistic pleasure, their desires tempered by the stultifying hand of conditioning. Beneath this façade, a more sinister reality lurks, where the common folk are reduced to pawns in a grand game of ideological manipulation.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist dialectics, Huxley's masterpiece reveals the undercurrents of suspicion towards the burgeoning economy of his time. The pervasive use of terms like homogeny and reification serves as a testament to the author's unease with the emerging order. The specter of capitalism looms large, its true nature obscured by the smokescreen of false consciousness. Like a thief in the night, it steals the proletariat's awareness of their own condition, rendering them mute and acquiescent to the whims of their betters.\n\nThe lower echelons of society, the Deltas and Gammas, are reduced to automatons, their wills supplanted by the insidious whisper of hypnopædia, which exhorts them to indulge, to consume, to surrender to the void. And at the helm of this charnel house, the World Controller reigns supreme, a master puppeteer manipulating the strings of the masses. Hegemony, that insidious force that reduces social classes to a mere plaything of the powerful, holds sway in this bleak world, where the lower classes are complicit in their own oppression, their very existence a testament to the efficacy of the system.\n\nIn this world devoid of passion, of true connection, of genuine relationships, Huxley reveals the sterile, loveless existence that arises from the marriage of technology and capitalism. The characters, once they attempted to be flesh and blood, now reduced to cardboard cutouts, their interactions a hollow mockery of human connection. Their words, a litany of shallow trivialities, a paean to the vacuous idol of physical appearance. And in the societal classes' complete acceptance of their station, we see the Marxian thesis of the proletariat's false consciousness writ large, a testament to the insidious power of the system to reduce humanity to a mere abstraction, a cog in the machine of oppression.",
            "The dusty expanse of University Park has been my domain for nigh on two and a half years now, a score of semesters creeping by like dark hours in the night. For many, the very notion of navigating its twisting paths and broad thoroughfares is a Sisyphean task. I recall my earliest days, lodged in the dormitory of East Halls, a distant outpost on the farthest rim of the campus, the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center looming like sentinels beyond the horizon. The trek from my humble abode in Stuart Hall to the hallowed halls of Willard, a bastion of learning situated at the very heart of the campus, would often consume a quarter of an hour, the rain-soaked streets and wind-whipped leaves conspiring to slow my progress. And yet, I was not alone in my plight. A chance encounter with a seasoned alumnus, a man not many years my elder, revealed to me a tale of yore, a time when the East Halls stood isolated, ringed by a vast expanse of vacant land. The years have passed, and that desolate terrain has given way to a tapestry of sports fields, grand edifices, and apartments, a sprawling metropolis that has only served to heighten the sense of disconnection. As the campus continues to sprawl, the very fabric of our daily lives becomes increasingly enmeshed in the struggle to traverse its length and breadth. In this wilderness of pavement and steel, the humble bicycle stands as a beacon of hope, a means of locomotion that transcends the limitations of foot and wheel. But alas, the bike itself is a mere tool, a mere instrument, and it is the will of the rider that must be steeled to wield it. The campus, too, must be reshaped to accommodate the needs of its two-wheeled citizens.\n\nI chanced upon a friend, a man who had recently rediscovered the joys of cycling after a protracted absence. His words still linger in my mind: \"Bikes are a revelation,\" he said, his voice laced with a hint of wonder. \"For a time, it wasn't fashionable to ride, but now I see it as the only reasonable way to traverse this vast expanse.\" And indeed, the bicycle offers a clarity of purpose that is hard to find in the hurly-burly of daily life. A simple bowl of oatmeal and the gentle toil of pedaling can carry one farther than the eye can see. I, too, have found myself bound to the campus's periphery, a captive of the off-campus world. And yet, the acquisition of a bike has proven to be a stroke of wisdom, a decision that has shaved precious minutes from my daily routine. The Thomas building, a bastion of learning and knowledge, lies within easy cycling distance, a mere five minutes from my doorstep, should I pedal with haste. Alas, the road that stretches between my home and my destination, Pollock Road, is a pathway fraught with peril, a serpentine course that twists and turns through the heart of the campus. It is a route that tests the mettle of even the most resolute cyclist. And yet, it is a path I must tread, for without my bike, the only alternative would be a pedestrian's plodding pace, a journey that would consume a full half-hour, nay, an hour, of my precious time. The arithmetic is stark: an additional two and a half hours each week, lost in the mire of walking, a sum that I can ill afford."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The pursuit of a profession in social work beckons like a siren's call, drawing me to the shadows of a world where the vulnerable are preyed upon by the very ones who should protect them. It is a world where the tender shoots of childhood are withered by the cruel hand of abuse, where the fragile bonds of family are rent asunder by the weight of neglect. And yet, it is a world I feel compelled to enter, to walk among the broken and the bereft, to offer what solace I can.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, certain values stand as beacons of hope: service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of relationships, both between individuals and within oneself. These are not ideals to be lightly considered; they are the very threads that weave the tapestry of a life worth living. I have walked among the ruins of others' lives, witnessed the desperation and the despair that can drive even the strongest to flee from their problems, to deny the darkness that follows them. And I have seen the frailty of those who turn to coping mechanisms that only serve to perpetuate their suffering.\n\nIt was in the midst of such a scene, one summer's day, that I chanced upon a young boy, his eyes wide with fear, his soul beset by the cruelty of those who should have protected him. I watched as he fled, as he sought refuge in the arms of a friend, and I knew then that I had to act. I had to take a stand, to offer what little I could to stem the tide of his suffering. And so, I spoke out, my words falling like a stone into a still pond, ripples of consequence spreading outward, touching the lives of all who heard them.\n\nBut it was not until I faced the parents, their eyes darting back and forth like trapped animals, that I understood the true nature of the darkness that had taken hold. They denied, they rationalized, they blamed the victim for the pain they had inflicted. And in that moment, I knew that I had to dedicate my life to the fight against such cruelty, to the defense of the vulnerable, to the pursuit of justice for the forgotten.\n\nSocial justice, that great and elusive ideal, beckons to me still. It is a call to arms, a clarion cry that echoes through the chambers of my heart. I have protested, I have spoken out against the injustices that I have seen, against the petty cruelties that masquerade as tradition, against the suffocating weight of conformity that seeks to stifle the unique voice of the individual. I have worn my hair in colors that defy the norm, I have pierced my skin with symbols of my defiance, I have stood shoulder to shoulder with those who would be marginalized, and I have spoken out against the systemic cruelties that seek to silence the voice of the oppressed.\n\nIn this, I am not alone. For in a world that claims to value the individual, yet seeks to crush their every step, I am a part of a long line of rebels, of outcasts, of those who would challenge the status quo and seek a world where the vulnerable are protected, where the marginalized are lifted up, and where the individual is free to be themselves, unencumbered by the weight of expectation.",
            "In the dark recesses of the human experience, there exist afflictions that beset the mind and body with equal ferocity. Insomnia, a disorder born of both flesh and circumstance, defies easy categorization. Its tendrils reach deep into the marrow of our being, sowing discord and unrest. The biological model, a cold and unforgiving lens, seeks to illuminate the genetic and physiological underpinnings of this malady. It looks to the neurons in the hypothalamus, those tiny, insistent whisperers that govern the ebb and flow of our waking and sleeping states. The orexin neurons, those subtle agents of slumber, contain within them the seeds of our very somnolence. The activation of the GABAB receptor, a receptor whose very presence is a testament to the intricate ballet of our internal workings, induces responses that promote the surrender to sleep. And yet, its inhibition, a mere whisper in the darkness, can conjure forth a reduction in anxiety, a stilling of the turbulent mind.\n\nThe mice, those creatures of curious observation, have been used to shed light upon this phenomenon. In the sterile confines of the laboratory, scientists have discovered that the phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons hold the key to our very ability to slumber. The administration of baclofen, a GABAB agonist, has been shown to prolong the duration of sleep, a testament to the subtle yet potent influence of this receptor. The implications of this study are far-reaching, speaking as they do to the very essence of our humanity. For if the genetic and environmental factors that shape our GABAB receptor are disrupted, the consequences are dire indeed. Our ability to rest, to find solace in the darkness, is compromised. And with it, the very fabric of our lives is rent asunder.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are far-reaching, a reminder that our struggles with insomnia are not solely the province of the individual. They are a testament to the complex interplay of our biology and our environment. The whisper of our genetic makeup, the sigh of our circumstances, all conspire to shape our experience of the world. And it is in this darkness, this void of sleep, that we find ourselves lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.",
            "In the depths of the mind, a chasm lies, a void that separates the external world from the inner recesses of comprehension. This is the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a condition where the brain's ability to decipher the whispers of the world is lost. It is not a deficiency of hearing, but rather a aberration in the labyrinthine corridors of the central nervous system. The brain, that great organ of perception, falters in its duty to translate the cacophony of sounds into a coherent language of meaning. The sufferer may hear the words, but they remain a jumble of discordant notes, a symphony without melody or harmony.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder emerged in the mid-century, a faint murmur of awareness that would grow into a crescendo of understanding. Researchers, like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, ventured into the uncharted territories of the mind, developing tests to navigate the unexplored landscapes of the brain. Kimura's work in 1961, a pioneering effort to unlock the secrets of dichotic perception, marked a turning point in the understanding of this enigmatic disorder.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are as varied as the sands of the desert. The afflicted may struggle to pinpoint the source of a sound, to distinguish between the competing demands of the environment. They may falter in the face of conflicting aural stimuli, their brain unable to synthesize the discrete elements into a coherent whole. They may fail to recognize the patterns that govern the world, the rhythms and cadences that govern the flow of human interaction. They may be unable to discern the nuances of speech, the subtle shifts in tone and inflection that convey meaning and emotion. And they may be lost in the sequence of events, unable to grasp the temporal relationships that underlie the world's unfolding drama.\n\nDiagnosis, a process fraught with uncertainty, requires a nuanced understanding of the patient's inner workings. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists must navigate the labyrinthine corridors of the mind, using a variety of tools to probe the depths of the sufferer's auditory world. They must observe the patient's responses to stimuli, the way they navigate the complexities of sound and silence. And they must interpret the data, sifting through the noise to uncover the underlying patterns that govern the sufferer's perception.\n\nNo single test can claim a high rate of diagnostic success, and the underlying causes of the disorder remain shrouded in mystery. But the pursuit of understanding continues, driven by the insatiable curiosity of researchers and clinicians. They probe the depths of the mind, seeking to illuminate the dark recesses of the brain, to unlock the secrets of this enigmatic disorder and to offer hope to those who suffer from its ravages.",
            "The veil of deception, a shroud that shrouds the soul, threatens to consume all in its path. Twelfth Night whispers a haunting truth: that the art of disguise, though a potent tool for deception, ultimately demands a reckoning. To remain hidden is to risk losing oneself, forever entombed in a prison of one's own making. The price of unmasking is steep: alienation, a chasm that yawns wide between the self and those who once knew us. We are forced to choose between the preservation of our own essence and the fragile bonds that tie us to others. And yet, how many of us will find solace in the neutrality of strangers, rather than the vitriol of those who once called us friend?\n\nIn the realm of gender, the masquerade assumes a particularly sinister form. What drives us to don the disguise of another, to abandon the fragile shell of our own identity? Viola's tale is a testament to the primal urge for self-protection, a desperate bid to survive in a world where the strong devour the weak. \"I'll lead you to a captain in this town,\" she says, \"where my maiden's weeds lie, and by whose gentle aid I was preserved to serve this noble count\" (5.1.247-249). In the unforgiving landscape of a foreign land, Viola assumes a masculine guise, a ruse that shields her from the ravages of those who would seek to do her harm. But in doing so, she sacrifices the very connections that might have sustained her, severing the ties that bind her to her own kind.\n\nHer ruse is so convincing that it ensnares even those who know her not, including the lovesick Olivia, who confuses her with her own brother, Sebastian. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). And yet, Viola's disguise also reignites the smoldering embers of her own desires, as she finds herself torn between the affections of Orsino and the unrequited passion that burns within her. \"Boy, thou hast told me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261). Thus, Twelfth Night becomes a curious case study in the alchemy of deception, where the hidden truths of the heart are forced into the light.\n\nBut is this merely a testament to the liberating power of self-discovery, or a commentary on the societal constraints that bind us? Does Olivia's ardor for Cesario betray a deeper longing for a world beyond the narrow bounds of her own desires, or is it simply a reflection of the prurient gaze that society casts upon those who dare to be different? The evidence suggests the latter, as she effortlessly transfers her affections to Sebastian, and regards Cesario/Viola as a sibling, rather than a love interest. \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315). In this, we see a wry mockery of the very society that sought to constrain her, a world where judgment is meted out based on the superficial trappings of appearance rather than the depths of the soul.",
            "In the vast expanse of German colonial rule, a stark reality emerged - one of brutality, a darkness that shrouded the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. To reduce this monstrosity to a simple label would be a travesty, a disservice to the complexities that defined the empire. Like the shifting dunes of the desert that stretched across its territories, the German colonial empire was a tapestry of varied policies and governance, a geography as unforgiving as it was diverse. The provision of education, too, was a patchwork of disparate threads, each colony weaving its own unique narrative.\n\nWhen the British claimed German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a population of Africans who possessed a certain... refinement, a literacy that spoke to the efforts of the Germans. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational endeavors were lauded by the chroniclers of the time. Yet, South West Africa presented a haunting contrast, a desolate landscape where the task of educating the natives was left to the benevolence of missionary societies, which received meager support from the government. And yet, the government lavished resources upon the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and regulating the missionary institutions with an iron hand. These policies would leave an indelible mark on South West Africa, a legacy that would persist long after the German rule had faded into memory. While other colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained a bastion of ignorance, a place where the overwhelming majority of its people remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The reasons for this divergence were complex, a tangled web of social, political, and economic factors that would prove resistant to easy explanation. This paper seeks to untangle these threads, to shed light upon the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans, and to illuminate the path that led to this divergent experience.\n\nA plethora of literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, a vast and often daunting corpus that stretches across languages and historical periods. Much of this work is in German, a tongue that spoke to the hearts of the colonizers, and was penned during or shortly after the period of German rule. The early writings were concerned primarily with describing the educational systems of the various colonies, a cataloging of the disparate ways in which the Germans sought to educate the natives. Later works, penned in English, expanded the discourse, comparing the educational systems of the different colonies and subjecting them to a more nuanced analysis. Among these studies, Cohen's work stands out, a comprehensive examination of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen's study seeks to explain the differences between the two colonies, and identifies the large settler population of South West Africa as a key factor in shaping its educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of contrasts, where the desert sands gave way to temperate climates, and the European population grew in tandem with the relative hospitability of the territory. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, a number dwarfed only by the settler population of East Africa, where 5,336 Europeans resided.",
            "In the shadow of a century, popular music has sprawled forth like a twisted labyrinth, its paths beset on all sides by an impenetrable thicket of genres. The very fabric of this music has been rent asunder by an endless proliferation of sub-genres, each one a splintered offshoot of its predecessor, a maddening proliferation that threatens to consume all in its path. And within this maelstrom, heavy metal stands as a behemoth, its dark and tortured form twisting and writhing like a living thing.\n\nBorn of the desperation and disillusionment of a bygone era, heavy metal has given rise to a thousand divergent strains, each one a fevered attempt to capture the essence of the music's dark and primal heart. It is a music of excess, a cacophonous tapestry woven from threads of volume, velocity, and sheer, unadulterated fury. The metal musician is a virtuoso, a technician of sound, his hands moving with a precision and speed that belies the chaotic, anarchic nature of the music itself.\n\nAnd yet, it is in the darkness that heavy metal finds its truest expression. The music is a reflection of the abyss that stares back at us from the mirror, a void that yawns open its maw and devours all in its path. It is a music born of the night, of the shadows that dance upon the wall, of the secrets that we dare not speak aloud. The Romantic era's dark, visceral legacy haunts the music, a ghostly presence that whispers secrets in the ears of the initiated.\n\nConsider the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\", a song that trembles with the aftershocks of a revolution yet to come. A response to the Rolling Stones' own dark and heavy incantations, it is a declaration of intent, a statement of purpose that announces the arrival of a new era in music. The darkness that seethes within its lyrics is a darkness that cannot be contained, a maelstrom of emotions that threatens to consume all in its path.\n\nIn this music, we find the twisted, nightmarish landscape of the human condition, a world of darkness and despair that stares back at us from the mirror. It is a music that defies categorization, a hydra-headed monstrosity that cannot be pinned down or contained. And yet, it is precisely this quality that has given rise to its enduring power, a power that continues to fascinate and terrify us to this day.",
            "In the somnambulant haze that precedes the stirrings of the surrealist dawn, an artist dwelled, his brushstrokes whispering secrets to the canvas. Henri Rousseau, a man beset by the specter of uncertainty, tortured by the demons of his own ambition. His masterpiece, The Dream, born in 1910, a testament to the turmoil that gnawed at his very soul. For in its ethereal landscapes and dreamlike visions, Rousseau poured out his deepest longings: the desire for recognition, for acceptance, for the validation of his craft by the very art world he revered.\n\nBut the path to such accolades was fraught with peril. Rousseau's journey was one of self-doubt and struggle, a Sisyphean effort to reconcile the artist within with the conventions without. To conform, to mimic the styles of his contemporaries, or to forge his own path, to stumble through the wilderness of his own creativity? The internal battle raged on, a maelstrom of conflicting desires that threatened to consume him whole.\n\nTo comprehend The Dream, one must delve into the labyrinthine corridors of Rousseau's biography. Born on a fateful May day in 1844, in the town of Laval, he was the son of a tinsmith, a man of modest means, blessed with a bourgeois prosperity that would prove a double-edged sword. No formal training in the arts, only the rough-hewn tools of a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, to guide his early years. The burden of his grief, the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, weighed heavily upon him, leaving only a daughter, Julia, to inherit his name. And so, in the midst of such sorrow, he turned to painting, a tentative step into the unknown, a quest for solace and redemption.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's brushstrokes spoke to the common man, a folk painter, unbridled by the conventions of the art world. His obsession with acceptance, a fire that burned bright, was a testament to his unyielding desire to be seen, to be heard, to be acknowledged. And yet, in the shadow of greatness, he toiled, his works lost in the annals of time, until the arrival of Matisse, a painter of a different ilk, driven by a different passion, a different purpose. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed, Rousseau's quest was one of seeking the mundane, the conventional, the trite, in order to be admitted to the rarefied world of the Artiste Français, while Matisse, on the other hand, strove to avoid the banal, to transcend the ordinary.",
            "In the depths of our existence, a mystic bond weaves itself between the threads of ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. It is a connection that has been posited by the great thinkers, a notion that cannot be easily unraveled. John Keats' words, like a whispered secret, echo through the ages: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" For in the marrow of our being, we sense the inextricable tie between the two, a bond that cannot be forged through the hammer of reason or the chisel of experience. We are drawn to it, like moths to the flame, without the need for instruction or tuition.\n\nOur understanding of the world is forged in fire and stone, a tapestry woven from the threads of knowledge and experience. Yet, we are drawn to the realm of ethics and aesthetics with a singular passion, a yearning that defies explanation. We seek to grasp the essence of what is beautiful, to pin down the unnamable, like a moth in the spider's web. But it is a pursuit that is doomed to fail, for in the world of art and morality, there is a limit to language, a horizon beyond which we cannot tread.\n\nConsider the Mona Lisa, that enigmatic smile, a riddle wrapped in a mystery. We may prattle on about the nuances of light and shadow, the play of perspective and contrast, but in the end, it is not these things that capture the essence of her beauty. When we are asked to describe what draws us to a work of art or literature, we falter, our words reduced to the feeble phrase, \"There's just something about it.\" It is a confession, a recognition that there are some truths that cannot be spoken, only felt.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's words come to mind: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" In the same way, ethics has a language that defies the tongue, a language that speaks directly to the heart. As the great philosopher said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this unnamable quality, this je ne sais quoi, that is the very essence of art and morality, the thread that weaves them together.\n\nWe experience both art and morality at a level that is both seen and unseen, a realm that lies beyond the reach of language. It is a connection that is strongest in literature, where the art of storytelling becomes a reflection of the human condition. As McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" In the end, it is this congruence that makes literature so vital, so essential to our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.",
            "The Germany of today, a land forged in the crucible of its storied past, stands as a testament to the indomitable will of its people. From the snow-capped peaks of the Alps to the unforgiving shores of the Baltic, the nation's roots run deep, a testament to the primordial forces that have shaped its culture. In the cities of München and Kiel, where the Rhine and Elbe rivers converge, a unique tapestry of traditions has unfolded, a rich brocade woven from the threads of distant tribes and forgotten eras.\n\nThe shadow of Germania looms large, a land of ancient mystery, its name shrouded in dispute among the scholars and sages of old. Some claim it arose from the Tungrians, a long-forgotten tribe, their identity lost to the sands of time. Others whisper that it was Julius Caesar who first coined the term, a distinction born of his wars against the Gauls, a people whose language and customs he sought to understand. In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Caesar penned a glimpse into the Germanic tribes, their ceaseless battles with the Gauls a testament to their unyielding spirit. \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine,\" he wrote, \"with whom they are continually waging war...They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)\n\nThe spear, that potent symbol of their warrior culture, has been proposed as the source of their name, a fierce and primal instrument of war that has left an indelible mark on the annals of history. Others point to the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" a testament to the Germans' unbridled passion and unwavering ferocity. And yet, the truth remains elusive, lost in the mists of time, a mystery waiting to be unraveled.\n\nTacitus, that master chronicler of the ancient world, penned a paean to the Germans in his De Origine et situ Germanorum, a sweeping narrative that revealed the secrets of their origins. \"I should regard them,\" he wrote, \"as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd so, the Germans remained, a people apart, their isolation a testament to their unyielding will. They traded with the Romans, serving in their legions, their skills forged in the furnace of battle. Yet, they remained aloof, a people unto themselves, their culture a unique and enigmatic blend of tradition and innovation. In the shadows of the Roman Empire, they waited, their patience a testament to their unyielding resolve. And when the time came, they emerged, a force to be reckoned with, their indomitable spirit forged in the crucible of their storied past. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "My gaze fell upon the scene before me, a canvas of desolation, a tableau of unassuming ordinariness. My mind, a void, a chasm, a hollow vessel, stirred with the weight of observation but refused to anchor itself to any abstract understanding, any framework of thought. The world, a tapestry of detail, unfolded before me, a vast and unyielding expanse of color and form, yet my consciousness remained detached, a fluid, unmoored thing, aware of the moment without attachment.\n\nA book, a dusty relic of a bygone era, lay on a shelf, its pages yellowed with age. 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain', a title that held a certain allure, a promise of secrets revealed, of hidden truths unveiled. An artist, a mentor, a guide, had counseled me to seek out this tome, to unlock the mysteries of the creative process. I had always been drawn to the act of creation, the thrill of bringing forth something from nothing. And so, with a sense of trepidation, I embarked upon this journey, a path that wound through the labyrinth of the human experience.\n\nThe square frame, a tool of the artist, a means of simplifying the complex, of distilling the essence of the scene before me. But on this day, in this moment, I was unable to impose this framework upon the world. The bowl, a simple, everyday object, sat upon a plain, unadorned table, a testament to the banality of existence. And I, a mere observer, stood transfixed, a moth to the flame of the mundane.\n\nPicasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of color – these were the benchmarks against which I measured my own creative endeavors. And yet, as I stood there, frozen in contemplation, I felt a stirring within me, a sense of possibility, of potential. The beginnings of 'Work in Brown', a nascent thing, a germ of an idea, took shape in my mind.\n\nMy hand, a instrument of creation, a extensions of my will, hovered above the surface of the paper, poised to bring forth life. But first, a more humble task, a necessary evil, beckoned. The toilet, a receptacle for the discarded, the unwanted, demanded my attention. A brown package, a loathsome thing, refused to yield to my efforts, stubbornly clinging to the porcelain. I stood, a sentinel, a guardian of the mundane, frowning in frustration.\n\nThe mop, a tool of my trade, hung loosely in my hand, a green tie, a garish splash of color, constricting my neck. I stood, a figure of desolation, a man lost in a sea of indifference. And yet, as I gazed upon the offending bundle, a sense of resolve washed over me. The flush, a soothing balm, a moment of peace, beckoned. And then, with a sense of resignation, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand in a makeshift mitt, a gesture both futile and defiant.\n\nAs I stood, a figure of desolation, a man lost in a sea of indifference, I felt a sense of calm, a sense of acceptance. The world, a vast and overwhelming expanse, receded into the background, and I was left with the simple, the mundane, the brown package, a thing both loathsome and beautiful.",
            "The killing fields of asphalt stretch out before them, a morass of steel and rubber where the young and the arrogant are cut down in their prime.  The statistics are stark, a grim litany of death and destruction that underscores the cruel fate of the teenage driver.  The National Institutes of Health posit that a significant portion of the blame lies with the fragile, untested brain of the adolescent, still reeling from the tumult of growth and development.  Inexperience, too, plays its part, a reckless indifference to the perils of the road that is as much a product of youth as it is of simple ignorance.\n\nThe presence of peers, those fluttering companions of the young, serves only to exacerbate the risk.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center bears witness to the corrosive influence of age and recklessness, a correlation as undeniable as it is sorrowful.  But the attempts to mitigate this carnage, to impose upon the young a semblance of restraint through provisional licenses and limited driving hours, only serve as a feeble palliative, a Band-Aid upon a wound that will not heal.\n\nThe real issue, as any honest examination of the data will reveal, is that the young are, as a group, woefully unprepared to confront the unforgiving realities of the road.  Marvin Zuckerman, a psychologist of unimpeachable credentials, has posited that the age of 18 is, even in this era of permissive indulgence, too young to be entrusted with the keys to a motor vehicle.  His research, borne of a keen understanding of the adolescent psyche, suggests that it is in the later teens and early twenties that the propensity for risk-taking begins to wane, a gradual lessening of the siren's call of reckless abandon.\n\nTo continue to issue licenses to the young, to indulge their passions for speed and thrill, is to invite a catastrophe of unspeakable proportions.  The demography of driving is about to shift, as the Baby Boomer's children come of age and take to the roads in their millions.  The prospect of unchecked carnage is a specter that haunts our collective conscience, a dire warning of what is to come if we fail to act.\n\nLegislation, it would seem, is the only bulwark against this onrushing tide of death and destruction.  Schools, those bastions of learning and wisdom, can continue to provide the necessary instruction in the art of driving, but the keys should remain out of reach of those who have not yet reached the age of reason, who have not yet tempered their impetuousness with a measure of prudence.  A provisional permit, a stepping stone to full licensure, can still be granted, but only after a period of practical instruction, honed to the number of hours deemed necessary by the majority of states.  Uniform, national legislation, rather than a patchwork of state-by-state regulations, is the only way to stem the tide of this national scourge.\n\nThis is no novel proposal, but a blunt acknowledgment of the facts, a recognition that we have been asleep at the wheel, that we have allowed our children to be slaughtered on the highways in a preventable carnage that is both tragic and senseless.",
            "In the musty recesses of the Library of Congress's vast repository of early Edison films, I found myself drawn to the trick films - fifteen in all, dating from 1895 to 1901. These early trifles, with their contrived manipulations, seemed to rely on the cunning art of editing to birth illusions. My study, a meandering path through the labyrinthine world of film, focused on unraveling the poetic essence of these trick films and charting the incremental deviations from the norm that appeared in a few of the later, more daring examples.\n\nIt was a peculiar thing, this turn-of-the-century trick film, bound to the strictures of the proscenium stage. Composed within the foreordained frame, it eschewed the fluidity of camera movement, instead employing long, static shots and medium shots, its narrative tethered to the stilted conventions of the \"one shot, one film\" dictum. And yet, as the century wobbled forward, certain aberrant films defied these strictures, indulging in the novelty of multiple shots.\n\nA most striking feature of the trick films, a trait that linked them in a shared umbilical cord, was their predilection for filming within the confines of a proscenium set. The camera, an unyielding sentinel, remained rooted to its station, unswayed by the ebb and flow of action. This composition, a direct import from the theatre and vaudeville, a realm of smoke and mirrors, dictated the limitations of the trick films. The figures within these films, constrained by the dictates of the stage, moved only in a lateral plane, their paths predetermined by the spatial confines. Witness, for example, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors entered from the right, their movements confined to the horizontal axis, never once straying from the predetermined path.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style, a visual corollary to the theatre's stubborn adherence to tradition, also led to a dearth of close-up shots. The Edison catalog, a vast repository of trick films, yielded not a single instance of this more intimate, intrusive frame. The theatre, after all, had always been a realm of spectacle, where the entire performance was laid bare for all to see, framed by the unyielding borders of the stage. And so, the actors, rooted to the middle ground, never once ventured forth to breach the camera's gaze.\n\nIn these early trick films, a single conceptual shot was often the equivalent of a cinematic monolith, its brevity and self-containment a testament to the era's nascent understanding of the medium. Most trick films, confined to the realm of the minute or less, focused on the vaudeville-style trifles that had given birth to the genre: magic, disappearing acts, and the art of switching. And yet, a more discerning eye, one attuned to the subtle artifices of the trick film, would detect the seams where the individual shots were joined, the moment when the physical shot gave way to the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Observe, for example, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films, and note the subtle juncture where the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" commences, even as the film remains, to the viewer's eye, a singular, unbroken whole.",
            "In a time long past, a man named John Taylor stood resolute, a champion of the unwavering creed that had taken hold of his heart - the unyielding commitment to the ideals of Republicanism. His life, marked by the sweat and toil of the land, and a fleeting foray into the realm of politics, had tempered him like steel in the fire of conviction. For in the eyes of this ardent proponent, the very profession that had shaped his existence - the unforgiving yet majestic world of agriculture - held the secrets to a far more profound truth: the foundation upon which all his opinions on governance were built.\n\nHis vision for a nation, born of the promise of a tabula rasa, unencumbered by the weight of tradition, was a system of self-governance, wherein the voices of the people, uncorrupted by the taint of power, might yet speak with a voice of reason. And yet, it was not merely a naive utopian dream that drove him, but a deep understanding of the inherent duality that lay at the heart of humanity - the eternal struggle between the good and the evil that lurked within.\n\nFor Taylor, the notion of the \"state of nature\" was a cruel joke, a world where the strong preyed upon the weak, where the cunning and the ruthless held sway over the meek and the timid. But in the realm of civilization, he believed, this must not be the case. It was in this context that he posited the existence of a government, not as a panacea for the ills of humanity, but as a necessary bulwark against the darkness that threatened to consume all.\n\nA government, he argued, must be constructed with the awareness of the inherent duality of human nature, a duality that would forever be in conflict. \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.\" The good principles, he posited, were those that protected private property, fostered the growth of agriculture, and checked the insatiable vice of capitalism. A government founded on such principles, he believed, would stand the test of time, its equanimity unshaken by the vicissitudes of administration, which, inevitably, would be driven by avarice and self-interest.\n\nYet, it was not the absence of self-interest that was the problem, but rather its unchecked excesses, which gave rise to sub-societies that preyed upon the vulnerable. A good government, he argued, was necessary not to eradicate this frailty, but to contain it, to hold it in check, lest it consume the very fabric of society.\n\nTaylor's stance on the Constitution was equally resolute. He advocated for a strict construction, one that bound the Federal government to the strictures of the document, limiting its powers to those explicitly stated, lest it become an instrument of despotism. And yet, he was not naive to the dangers of a literal interpretation, which, without reference to the intent of the framers, could lead to corruption and abuse. For in his estimation, the Declaration of Independence remained the true charter of the United States, a document that spoke to the very essence of the nation's existence as a confederation of sovereign states, rather than a monolithic entity.",
            "The precipitous drop in commuter logs in the third month was a desolate sight, a stark reminder that the fervor of initiative had begun to wane. The onset of winter's chill, the campus shrouded in snow and ice, had doubtless claimed its share of cyclists and pedestrians, leaving the roads empty and still. And then, too, the end of the semester had brought a deluge of tasks and deadlines, a maelstrom that swept all else aside, including the humble commuter log. The holiday season, with its attendant festivities and distractions, had only served to further erode the already flagging participation. Classes, too, had resumed in late January, a reminder that the cycle of academic life had turned once more, leaving the log submissions lagging far behind.\n\nBut it was February, that blank and unforgiving month, that posed the greatest enigma. Had the project's initial momentum, that initial burst of energy and enthusiasm, simply burned itself out, leaving naught but a faint ember of interest? The Carpool Challenge Week, a desperate attempt to rekindle the flames, had paid some dividends, yielding a modest increase in submissions for March. Yet, it remained a faint glimmer of hope in an otherwise desolate landscape. The challenge, it seemed, lay not only in countering the natural ebb and flow of engagement, but in combating the fundamental allure of the automobile, that stalwart companion to our daily lives.\n\nThe prizes, too, had played their part, a meager incentive in a world where the freedom of the open road is a cherished privilege. Gift certificates to local eateries and shops had been our offering, a paltry reward for a sacrifice that few were willing to make. It was a curious thing, indeed, to consider what might have been achieved with more substantial prizes – a bicycle, a hybrid car, an electric vehicle – symbols of a different way of living, one that few were willing to adopt. The prizes, however, remained static throughout, a constant in a world that was ever-changing.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that a more dynamic approach might have been required, one that promised a greater reward for those who chose to brave the elements, to forgo the comfort of their own vehicles. Had we announced a series of escalating prizes, a ladder of rewards that grew higher and higher, perhaps we might have seen a greater surge in participation. But it was not to be. The logs, they remained stubbornly low, a testament to the enduring power of habit and the allure of the automobile.",
            "In the desolate landscape of finance, there existed a creature known as the exchange traded fund, or ETF, a monstrosity born from the union of index, commodity, and asset, its form fluid and shape-shifting like the sands of the desert. It was said to possess the diversification of a sire, the benefits of single stock ownership a siren's call to the unwary investor. The promise of liquidity, of the ability to sell short, to buy on margin, to possess as few as a single share, was a tantalizing one, a whispered secret known only to the initiated. And yet, like the haunted landscape of the American West, there were costs, hidden pitfalls that lurked in the shadows. The expense ratios, a woeful toll, a burden borne by the investor, far lower than those of the average mutual fund, yet a weight to be reckoned with nonetheless.\n\nIn the twilight world of ETFs, the IHF loomed large, a behemoth of diversification, its top ten holdings a promised land of riches. But was it a mirage, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckoned the unwary investor to the precipice of financial ruin? To evaluate this monstrous creature, we narrowed our focus to the top ten holdings, those that comprised 63.58% of its assets, a fraction of the whole, yet a glimpse into the heart of the beast.\n\nThrough the lens of a chart, we beheld the Beta and Return of this subset of holdings, a snapshot of the ETF's very essence. And what did we find? The return, a tantalizing 6.11% greater than the ETF itself, a 16% increase, a siren's call to the investor. And the Beta, a mere .12 lower, a whisper of the safety that lay within. But was this a promise to be trusted? Or a lie, a deceitful whisper in the darkness?\n\nTo answer this, we turned to the standard deviation, that most unforgiving of metrics. We normalized the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, a cold calculation, devoid of passion or sentiment. And what did we find? A portfolio of just these ten holdings, a configuration of the ETF's very essence, offered a higher return, a lower Beta. But was this a statistical certainty, or a mere possibility? The answer, like the desert itself, remained shrouded in mystery.",
            "In the dim recesses of Edgar Allan Poe's oeuvre, \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to his command of the darker corners of the human experience. The reappearance of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, as noted by Mabbott, draws our attention to the rippling currents of influence that shaped his work. Virgil's utilization of the term, referencing the fabled island north of Britain, served as a point of departure for Poe's own exploration. Yet, it is in the realm of German literature that we find a more proximate source to which due acknowledgment is owed. Poe's affinity for the works of Goethe is well-documented, a fact that assumes added significance in light of the striking similarities between their respective creations.\n\nThe pertinence of this connection becomes apparent in the words of Karl J. Arndt, who, in his study of Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, discerns a marked homology between the two poets' works, with the conclusion that Poe was, in all likelihood, drawing upon Goethe's inspiration. The celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust, Goethe's magnum opus, published in two parts – the first in 1808, the second in the year of his passing, 1832 – contains, within its somber verse, a concise poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This narrative tells the tale of a monarch whose wife, in her final gesture of love, bestows upon him a goblet, only to succumb to the weight of his grief, which he assuages with an excess of drink and tears.\n\nThe parallels between this narrative and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, as if the latter stands in dark, funereal relation to the former. The King of Thulé's descent into the abyss of despair, his abandonment of the world, and his eventual surrender to the void, serves as a haunting mirror to the speaker's own anguish in \"Dream-Land,\" where the desolate landscape of Thule stretches out like a shroud, a realm of shadows and forgotten joy. The repetition of the term \"Thulé\" in Poe's work, a refrain that bookends \"Dream-Land,\" serves to underscore the connection to Goethe's poem, as if the speaker has stepped into the very realm of the King of Thulé.\n\nGoethe's stature as a literary giant is well-attested, and Poe's regard for him is evident in his admiration for Tennyson. Though the connection to Tennyson serves as a testament to Poe's erudition, it is the prevalence of Goethe's work in the cultural landscape of the time that provides a more immediate explanation for his influence. The multiple reproductions of Goethe's works, following the initial publication of Faust, would have assured Poe's familiarity with the German writer's oeuvre.",
            "The sterile sky hung above the market, a distant hum of indifference to the travails that unfolded beneath. In the realm of California's laws, a plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, seeks to claim punitive damages for the injuries she sustained after slipping on an applesauce spill within the walls of D&D Markets. The question looms: did the store manager, Paul Martin, act with malice, heedless of the probable harm that would befall those who traversed the store's aisles? The issue is not so simple as a yes or no, but rather a tapestry of intent and consequence, woven from the threads of knowledge and neglect.\n\nA judge, arbiter of the law, is unlikely to dismiss Palmer's claim out of hand. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful disregard for the probable harm that would result, and that the conduct itself was despicable. Palmer's argument is twofold: that Martin should have known the probable harm of neglecting the spill, given the precedent of multiple incidents in the months prior, and that he failed to act despite such knowledge. Though the claim that Martin's actions were despicable may be tenuous, it is not without merit, given the weight of six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, and Martin's inaction in the face of such knowledge.\n\nOn that fateful day, October 13, 2009, at five o'clock in the evening, Rich Wayne, a store employee, informed Martin of the spill in the aisle. Martin's response was a dismissive one, a brush-off to the concerns of his customer, and a prioritization of his own dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, approached Martin with the same news, and met with the same disregard. It was thirty minutes of inaction, a span of time that would prove calamitous for Palmer, who slipped and fell at 5:30 pm, sustaining a serious injury to her back. The store, D&D Markets, had seen five previous slip-and-fall incidents in the year prior, each a missed opportunity to correct a systemic flaw, each a harbinger of the disaster that would soon unfold.\n\nIn California, the law recognizes the right of a plaintiff to seek punitive damages for a breach of obligation, if the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of such intent, a despicable act committed with a willful disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts have come to characterize such conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, and a willful failure to avoid the consequences of such actions. It is this standard that Palmer will seek to satisfy, in her quest for justice and recompense.",
            "It has been nigh on four winters since I first set foot in a classroom, seated among the dusty tomes and worn desks of CBC.  There, amidst the ceaseless din of debate, one query unsettled the air: was Islam a faith born of hostility?  The question still festers, a suppurating wound that time has failed to heal.  After the calamitous events of 9/11, I watched as the media's stance on Islam underwent a precipitous shift, veering from a stance of abhorrence to one of saccharine tolerance.  A mere two decades ago, a presidential candidate with a Muslim name would have been unimaginable, yet now such a figure sits in the highest office of the land.\n\nThe life of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, a paradox that defies easy comprehension.  The biography that has come down to us presents a man who, far from the conqueror I had long believed him to be, was instead a martyr, a supplicant who bent his knee to the whims of fate.  One by one, the faithful flocked to his banner, drawn by the radiance of his conviction, not by the sword.  This narrative, I now see, was crafted to convey a man of humility, a holy man who required no proof of his divine calling.\n\nThere are, however, unsettling parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad.  The story of the multiplication of bread and milk, a miracle that fed the forty men in his company, stands out in particular.  This narrative, I suspect, was woven to present Muhammad as a man of quiet strength, a prophet who stood apart from the vainglorious trappings of power.  It is this strategy that troubles me, for it diminishes the singular majesty of Jesus Christ, a man who stood alone, unencumbered by the need for validation.\n\nThe biography, too, is replete with anecdotes that seek to establish the authenticity of the Prophet's teachings.  These tales, however, are often second- or third-hand, recounted by others, far removed from the event itself.  The result is a narrative that strains credulity, a patchwork of hearsay and legend.  I find it difficult to accept such a narrative as proof, for it lacks the weight of direct testimony.\n\nBut it is the portrayal of Muhammad as a paragon of virtue that most offend me.  This holy man, revered by millions, is often depicted as a figure of unassailable wisdom, of compassion and gentleness.  Yet the annals of history suggest otherwise, a more complex, more troubled figure, whose ascent to power was marked by bloodshed and strife.  I am left to wonder if the faithful are aware of the true nature of their Prophet, or if they remain blind to the darkness that shrouds his legacy.",
            "In the aftermath of Jesus' mortal coil, the teachings he left behind were eroded by the relentless tide of Christian thought.  Like a river's course, which winds its way through the landscape, ever-changing, ever-shifting, so too did the Christian faith.  The waters of tradition, the sediment of doctrine, and the currents of dogma all conspired to carry the faith further and further from its source.  Yet, in this vast, dark expanse of time, a faint glimmer of awareness begins to stir.  A growing number of souls, weary of the stifling weight of tradition, yearn to peel back the layers of dogma, to strip away the accretions that have accumulated like barnacles on a hull, and to rediscover the living, breathing Jesus at the heart of it all.  This will not be a swift or easy process.  It will be a gradual, reluctant, and painful one, like the unmooring of a ship from its anchors.  But it will happen.  History is replete with such reversals - the Roman Empire, once a bastion of paganism, became a Christian empire; our own nation, once a bastion of slavery, became a beacon of freedom.  And so too will the Christian faith undergo a great reversal, a great unwinding of the coils of time, a great unmaking of doctrine and dogma.  It will be a process of stripping away, of peeling back the layers, of returning to the raw, unvarnished Jesus, the Jesus who spoke in parables and paradoxes, who defied literal interpretation and beckoned us to the depths of the human heart.  To read his words as metaphor, not as dogma, is to join this great reversal, to embark on the journey back to the source, to the wellspring of faith itself.  And what did the world look like before the tides of Christian thought swept across it?  It was a world of Judaism, a world of the Hebrew scriptures, a world of monotheism and divine revelation.  A world of division and splintering, where the Jewish people were rent asunder by the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Zealots, each with their own interpretation of the divine.  But even in that fractured world, there was a common thread, a common purpose, a common humanity that underlay it all.  And so too will it be in the future, when the great reversal has taken place, and the Christian faith has returned to its source, when the waters have stilled and the sediment has settled.  The world will be a simpler, more unified place, where the spirit of Jesus shines forth, unencumbered by the weight of tradition, unvarnished by the distortions of time.",
            "The scabrous underbelly of human nature is laid bare in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, a bleak testament to the innate greed and self-aggrandizement that festers within the hearts of men. It is an abyss of unyielding avarice, where the pursuit of wealth and power supplants all else, leaving in its wake a trail of devastation and despair. The factory owners and managers, monarchs of the great industrial behemoths, reign with an iron fist, crushing all who dare stand in their way. They care not for the toll their relentless pursuit takes on the land, nor for the lives they shatter with each passing day.\n\nAs Sinclair's words paint a picture of the ravaged landscape, the smoke-belching chimneys pierce the sky like skeletal fingers, a grim reminder of the devastation wrought by human greed. The rivers of smoke that stream away to the horizon are a stark testament to the disregard with which the owners view the world around them, a world they seek to exploit for their own selfish ends. The pens that house the thousands of animals, the putrid runoff of their waste, are but a mere afterthought, a trifling concern in their unyielding quest for profit.\n\nNor do they spare a thought for the wretched souls who toil in their factories, their sweat and blood the lifeblood of the industry. \"A seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" is what Sinclair calls this place, a pit of unrelenting cruelty, where the dollar is the only currency that holds value. The workers are cogs in a machine, dispensable and replaceable, their humanity stripped away by the cold calculus of commerce. They toil in darkness, their hours long and grueling, their lives reduced to a mere existence. And when they are cast aside, discarded like so much refuse, they are left to pick up the shards of their shattered lives, with no solace, no aid, and no respite.\n\nIn this era, the workers were but helpless pawns, preyed upon by the unscrupulous and the ruthless. The unions, formed with the intention of protecting their interests, often proved to be wolves in sheep's clothing, feeding on the very flesh they sought to defend. And so the workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and despair, were left to suffer, their lives a mere abstraction, a mere commodity to be bought and sold. \"A population,\" Sinclair writes, \"low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" The parallels are stark, the echoes of a dark and troubled past, a cautionary tale of the horrors that lie in wait when humanity is reduced to its basest impulses.",
            "The canvas of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is threaded with a tapestry of meanings, woven from the very fabric of language itself. He employs a multitude of techniques to coax a particular hue from his readers, to conjure an aura that clings to the page like the mist that veils the valley of ashes. Fitzgerald's palette is broad, his brushstrokes bold, as he pairs unlikely companions - an adjective and a noun - to conjure an essence that clings to the reader like the sweat on a summer's day. The colors of his world are imbued with significance, each one a key that unlocks a door to a realm of meaning.\n\nWhite and gray, those twin siblings of the mundane, are Fitzgerald's instruments of choice. He coaxes from them a meaning that is at once both familiar and distant, like the whispered secrets of a summer breeze. In the beginning of the novel, the whiteness is that of the newlyweds, Daisy and Jordan, their faces alabaster, their skin powdered and pale as the driven snow. And Tom, the old-money aristocrat, wears his white shirt like a badge of honor, a symbol of the class that he so desperately seeks to preserve. Even Nick, the outsider, is drawn into this world of white, his flannels crisp and clean as the driven snow.\n\nBut as the novel unfolds, Fitzgerald's palette darkens, the white giving way to a grayer, more muted hue. The world of the Valley of Ashes is a place of desolation, a wasteland of gray cars and gray land, where the once-white dreams of the American Dream have withered and died. And Daisy, that elusive creature, is reduced to a mere cipher, a uniform of white, a dress that conceals the emptiness within. Her whiteness is now a reminder of the uniformity that lies at the heart of the American experience, a world where the individual is lost in the crowd, a faceless, nameless, forgotten soul.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is a masterclass in the art of suggestion, a reminder that meaning is not always what it seems. The colors of his world are a reflection of the human condition, a world where the lines between reality and illusion are blurred, where the past and present coexist in a world of gray. And it is in this world of gray, this world of uniformity, that we find the true meaning of The Great Gatsby, a novel that is at once both a critique of the American Dream and a paean to its enduring power.",
            "The arid landscape of San Diego County lay barren and unforgiving, yet it was here that the land yielded its secrets to the gentle touch of human toil. A mild and sun-scorched climate coaxed forth a bounty of crops, each one a testament to the unfettered will of nature: the plump, crimson tomatoes, the verdant citrus, the leafy greens that sprouted like verdant fingers, the squash and broccoli that burst forth in shimmering profusion. And the trees, those stalwart sentinels of the land, stood watch over the berries, peaches, and lemons, their fruit a sweet and generous gift. The air was heavy with the scent of honey, a golden nectar that seemed to seep from the earth itself, and the peppers, those fiery guardians of the land, stood watch over all.\n\nThe market for organic produce was a siren's call, beckoning those who would listen to the rhythms of the land. The waiting lists for community-supported agriculture programs were long and winding, a testament to the allure of a life untainted by the harsh chemicals that had desecrated so much of the world. And the eggs and milk, those simple, wholesome staples, were sought after by those who craved the purity of the land.\n\nBut the lure of the land was not without its costs. The organic farmer labored under a harder yoke, his sweat and toil a necessary price for the bounty he sought to reap. The pests and weeds that infested the land demanded constant vigilance, their presence a reminder of the delicate balance that governed this world. And the soil, that rich and fertile cradle of life, required a gentle hand, a careful touch that would coax forth its secrets without despoiling its depths.\n\nYet, it was in this desolate yet fecund landscape that the landowner found a chance to redeem the land, to restore it to its former glory. The parcel of land, a 160-acre expanse of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, lay adjacent to the town of Potrero, a town that had grown up around the Cleveland National Forest. And it was here, in this fragile ecosystem, that the landowner might find a way to balance the books, to coax forth a profit from the land without desecrating its beauty.\n\nThe land had a history, a tale of untold centuries, of Native Americans who had walked these hills, their footsteps silent on the wind. And then, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers had come, their presence a scar on the land, a reminder of the human touch that had shaped this world. The original homestead patent had brought forth a new era, one of grazing and wood production, a cycle that had repeated itself for generations.\n\nIn my research, I had stumbled upon a real estate listing, a piece of property that seemed to whisper its secrets to me, a small farmer seeking to eke out a living in this unforgiving yet fecund land. I had scoured the government programs, searching for a way to mitigate the costs, to preserve the wildlife-friendly operations that would allow the land to flourish. And it was in this quest that I had found an organic farm in the same area, a model of what might be achieved, a testament to the power of the human spirit in this arid yet verdant landscape.",
            "Culture is a labyrinth, its contours ever-shifting, its outlines blurred by the shadows of what it is not. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what it signifies, of what it stands for, and what it has become. The notion of a singular, homogeneous culture is a myth, a mirage that vanishes upon closer inspection. The assertions that \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are little more than a whispered rumor, a faint echo of a truth that has been distorted by the passage of time. Yet, it is precisely these generalizations that lead us astray, that distract us from the subtle nuances that govern a culture's behavior in the crucible of negotiation.\n\nTo navigate the treacherous waters of cultural understanding, one must first learn to listen to the whispers of history, to the prejudices that have shaped the contours of a culture's soul. This is not a matter of judging or condoning, but of accepting the culture for what it is, of acknowledging its boundaries, its limitations. For the negotiator, this is a matter of paramount importance, especially when the playing field is uneven, when the stakes are high and the position is weak. In such circumstances, a deep respect for the traditions and beliefs of the opposing culture can be a lifeline, a thread that weaves its way through the darkness, guiding us forward, one tentative step at a time.\n\nBut culture is not a monolith, a single entity that can be reduced to a national or international dichotomy. It is a hydra, a many-headed beast that adapts, evolves, and mutates in response to its environment. Within the confines of a nation, a corporation can cultivate its own culture, a unique and intricate web of values, customs, and practices that set it apart from its peers. This corporate culture can be seen in the dress codes that govern the workplace, in the communication styles that flow like a river through its halls, in the hiring practices that seek out the best and brightest. Some companies are temples of industry, where long hours are a badge of honor, while others are sanctuaries of relaxation, where the boundaries between work and play are blurred. And within these companies, there are subcultures, hidden worlds that pulsate with their own rhythms, their own values.\n\nBut it is not just the external trappings of culture that are important; it is the values that lie at its core. These are the unseen forces that shape behavior, that govern the ways in which individuals interact with one another. If a culture values saving face above all else, a negotiator will be reluctant to engage in public displays of conflict, lest they bring shame upon themselves and their organization. If a culture values the pursuit of a hard-driven bargain above all else, a negotiator will be willing to push the limits of what is acceptable, to test the mettle of their opponent, to see who will blink first. And it is precisely this understanding of values that is essential to successful negotiation, for it is the unseen currents that flow beneath the surface of culture that can either make or break an agreement.\n\nTo navigate these currents, a negotiator must be willing to listen, to observe, and to learn. They must seek to understand their opponent on a personal level, to grasp the subtleties of their motivations, their fears, and their desires. For it is not the surface-level understanding of culture that will serve them well, but the deep understanding that comes from empathy, from a willingness to see the world through the eyes of another. This is the key to effective negotiation, the thread that weaves its way through the labyrinth of culture, leading us forward, one step at a time.",
            "The darkness whispers in the hearts of men, a voice that dares to declare the unutterable: \"There is no God.\" This is the cry that echoes through the ages, a refrain taken from the ancient texts of the Christian Bible, specifically the Psalm of the 14th verse. It is a notion that finds its echo in the work of Thomas Aquinas, a philosopher who sought to anchor the existence of the divine in the bedrock of reason. And yet, we find ourselves standing at the crossroads, tasked with comparing the arguments of two men, both champions of the same creed, to determine which one shines brighter in the light of truth.\n\nTo navigate this labyrinth, we must first concede the impossible – that both Anselm and Aquinas speak truth, their voices harmonizing in a hymn of praise to the same God. To posit a deity of ambiguous form would be to render their arguments sterile, mere exercise in futility. And so, we shall begin with the assumption that their God is the God of the Bible, a being of defined presence and purpose.\n\nAs we delve into the heart of Anselm's argument, we find a path that winds through the recesses of the human soul. He posits that God's existence is not a externality, something to be discovered in the world without, but rather an internality, a truth that resides within the very fabric of our being. The mind, that great instrument of comprehension, is the key to unlocking the puzzle of the divine. We are not required to venture forth into the wilderness of empirical evidence to find proof of God's existence; rather, the evidence lies within, a flame that flickers in the darkness, awaiting recognition. This is the essence of faith – a conviction that transcends the mundane, a leap of trust into the unknown.\n\nBut Aquinas journeys a different path, one that seeks to anchor the existence of God in the certainties of reason. His is an endeavor to prove the divine through the crucible of logic, to distill the essence of God from the alembic of empirical evidence. The proof, in his view, lies not in the whispers of the heart, but in the cold, unforgiving light of reason. He marshals five mighty arguments to his cause: the proof of change, the necessity of causation, the contingency of being, the gradations of excellence, and the harmony of the universe. In each, he demonstrates that the existence of God is not a mystery, but a necessity, a logical consequence of the very fabric of reality.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves standing at the crossroads, the arguments of these two great thinkers laid before us like a puzzle, each piece carefully crafted, each one a testament to the power of the human mind. Which one shall we choose? Shall we follow Anselm's path, a journey through the labyrinth of the soul, or shall we follow Aquinas, a path of reason and empirical evidence? The choice, like the existence of God, remains a mystery, waiting to be revealed in the depths of our own hearts.",
            "In a time long past, a prince would arise, a man who would come to be known as the Buddha. His footsteps would lead him down a path of renunciation, a path that would ultimately deliver him into the depths of enlightenment. And it was from this enlightenment that the seeds of Buddhism would be sown, a seed that would germinate into a vast and labyrinthine tree, its branches stretching forth across the centuries like skeletal fingers. It is a tree that now stands as the most orthodox of its kind, known as Theravada Buddhism. Twenty five hundred years have transpired since the Buddha's time, and the world has changed. Yet the echoes of that distant era still linger, like the whispers of a forgotten wind. In the land of Sri Lanka, a nation born of Theravada, the water-cutting ceremony takes place each year. Monks and laymen alike converge upon this spectacle, a ritual that holds significance, though one that the Buddha himself never spoke of. The fissures that have developed between the church and the world are manifold, a chasm that yawns wide between the superficial trappings of tradition and the soteriological core of the faith.\n\nThroughout the annals of time, the Theravada Buddhist community has been subject to the vicissitudes of internal and external forces. The former, a force born of the community itself, is a force both benign and malignant. The latter, an external force, is any influence that comes from without. It is this duality that will be a recurring theme throughout this discussion.\n\nAs we delve into the heart of Theravada, we find ourselves confronted with a rich tapestry of doctrine. The triple gem, the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, serves as the foundation upon which the entire edifice of the faith is built. The Dhamma, a vast and sprawling entity, comprises the Tripitaka, that most ancient and revered of texts. The Tripitaka is divided into three baskets, each one a repository of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, those sacred utterances of the Buddha himself. The Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, a code of conduct that guides the lives of both monk and layman. And the Abhidhamma Pitaka, that most obscure and esoteric of texts, contains the metaphysical musings of the faith. Here, the concepts of Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca hold sway. Anatta, the notion that the self is but a fleeting illusion; Dukkha, the inherent suffering that pervades all existence; and Anicca, the impermanence that governs all things. It is only through the recognition of these truths that one may transcend the cycle of death and rebirth, that great wheel of suffering known as Sansara. And with Sansara's demise, the three great pitfalls that beset humanity – lobha, dosa, and moha – will also be vanquished. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth a code of conduct for the layman, five simple yet profound precepts that guide his actions. For the monk, the rules are many and complex, a labyrinthine path that must be navigated with precision. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths, a quartet of unyielding principles that serve as the bedrock of the faith. First, the truth of Dukkha, the recognition that life is but a river of suffering. Second, the truth that attachment is the source of suffering. Third, the truth that suffering may be overcome.",
            "In the arid expanse of the North American continent, two nations lay bound by a tenuous thread of animosity that stretched across nearly six decades, from the parched earth of 1836 to the cusp of the twentieth century's first great conflagration in 1893. This was the United States and Mexico, two lands beset by a rivalry that ebbed and flowed like the Rio Grande, its source and terminus forever tied to the unyielding tides of history. The calamitous war of 1846-1848 stood as a watershed moment, a high-water mark that saw the United States lay claim to the spoils of Texas and the Southwest, leaving in its wake a scar that would never fully heal.\n\nAs the years marched on, the enmity between the two nations only deepened, fueled by the primal fires of conflicting interests and the unyielding convictions of a people. It was a struggle born of the crucible of history, forged in the fire of clashing cultures and the unyielding passions of a bygone era. The spectral presence of the past loomed large, a testament to the indelible mark left by the Spanish and English empires that had once ruled over these twin nations. The distrust that had been sown in those distant days would prove a fertile ground for the rivalries that would follow, a legacy that would shape the destiny of these two lands for generations to come.\n\nThe United States and Mexico were not alone in their struggle. Across the globe, nations born of shared borders and conflicting interests had long been locked in a dance of rivalry, their steps choreographed by the ancient rhythms of history. Yet, the particular flavor of this enmity was unique, a complex brew of ideological and material differences that would prove a potent elixir for the animosity that simmered between these two nations. As David M. Pletcher so astutely observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" – a truth that would be borne out by the tortuous path of relations between the United States and its southern neighbor.\n\nAt its core, the rivalry between the two nations was a struggle born of faith, a clash of incompatible visions for the future that would prove as intractable as the mountains that separated them. Sally Frahm noted that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Americans had been driven by a fervent opposition to Catholicism and monarchy, a dichotomy that would find its mirror image in the Mexican people's own unyielding devotion to the Catholic faith. This fundamental difference would prove a chasm that would be bridged only by the patient efforts of those willing to navigate the treacherous waters of diplomacy.\n\nOver the course of its 57-year tenure, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico would leave in its wake a trail of disputes that would number seventeen, a litany of border raids, territorial squabbles, and frontier conflicts that would leave the very fabric of their relationship frayed and worn. The specter of bandits and outlaws, those shadowy figures that had long haunted the borders of both nations, would prove a constant thorn in the side of those seeking to establish a lasting peace. It was only when the United States and Mexico came to recognize the futility of their endless struggle that the tide of history began to turn, as Mexico's dependence on the United States grew and American ambitions shifted from the pursuit of territorial expansion to the quiet calculus of economic intervention.",
            "Fifteen years ago, the darkness crept in, an uninvited guest that stole the breath from my lungs and left me crippled, a stranger in my own skin. I was a nurse then, a guardian of the sick and the frail, a keeper of secrets and a witness to the fragility of life. The fire that once drove me, a flame of purpose and ambition, had been reduced to a smoldering ember, a reminder of what could never be again.\n\nThe words of a well-meaning stranger lingered in my mind, a mantra repeated like a dirge: \"You'll always find work, for there will always be those who fall ill.\" And so I chose nursing, a profession born of necessity, a way to silence the gnawing doubts that haunted me since childhood. But the dreams I had, the scientist, the journalist, they were reduced to ashes, the embers of a fire that had been extinguished.\n\nFifteen years have passed, and I am still a shadow of my former self, a specter haunting the fringes of society, dependent on the charity of others for survival. The days blend together, a never-ending expanse of tedium and despair, a constant reminder that I am but a fragile, temporal thing. And yet, in the midst of this desolate landscape, there is one truth that I hold onto, a beacon of hope in a world that seems determined to extinguish it: I am not alone.\n\nIt is a lesson that has been driven home by the kindness of family and friends, the unwavering support of those who refused to abandon me in my darkest hour. And I know that I am not exceptional in this, for it is in the face of disaster that we discover our true strength, our capacity for compassion and resilience.\n\nWe are fond of speaking of rugged individualism, of the pioneers who braved the unknown, who forged a new path in the wilderness. But let us not forget that it was not the lone wolf that survived, but the communities that banded together, that shared what little they had, that offered a helping hand in the face of the unknown. We would do well to remember this, to recognize that it is not in our individual strength that we find true security, but in the bonds that tie us together.\n\nI have prepared for the worst, stocked my pantry with canned goods, my cupboard with candles and matches, my mind with the knowledge of how to survive in a world gone mad. But I have also learned that true preparedness lies not in the things we possess, but in the relationships we cultivate, the connections we make with those around us. For it is in the face of disaster that we discover our true character, our capacity for compassion, for kindness, for forgiveness.\n\nGet to know your neighbors, for it is in their eyes that you will find a glimmer of hope, a reflection of the humanity that binds us all together. Do not wait until the darkness descends, until the storm rages, to reach out, to seek help, to offer aid. For it is in the quiet moments, in the stillness of the day, that we find the strength to face the unknown, to stand together against the tempests that will inevitably come.",
            "The labyrinthine paths of evolution, a mystery that has confounded the most erudite of scholars since the dawn of time. D'Arcy Thompson, a man of vision and sage insight, spoke these words in 1917: \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" And so it remains, a truth we find ourselves entwined in, even as we strive to unravel the tangled threads of change within the mollusk's skeletogenesis.\n\nOur study, a foray into the uncharted territories of Prunum, seeks to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We have employed mathematical modeling, a tool of precision and elegance, to chart the ontogenetic and phylogenetic transformations of this enigmatic creature. X-radiographic images of Prunum species have been scrutinized, yielding quantitative parameters that have been fed into the software program CerioShell, a digital realm where hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies converge.\n\nWithin this virtual expanse, we have crafted a topology of possible shell forms, a map of the boundaries that contain the morphological potential of Prunum. These cartographies are being woven together with experimental and descriptive studies, an intricate tapestry that seeks to illuminate the macroevolutionary events that have shaped this clade.\n\nA shell, that most wondrous and intricate of structures, is a spiral of space and time, a tube that unwinds through 360 degrees of existence. The whorls, those concentric coils, spiral around an axis, a columella that runs through the central column of the shell like a thread through a needle. The speed of these whorls' growth can fluctuate, creating a suture, a line that separates each coil like the crease on a worn leather glove. The body whorl, the final coil, stands as the largest, a sentinel that guards the vulnerable aperture.\n\nThe spire, a series of whorls that precede the body whorl, rises like a shard of light from the darkness. The apex, the tip of this spire, pierces the sky, while the base, the opposite extremity, sinks into the earth. And from this opening, the mollusk emerges, a creature of mystery and beauty.\n\nThe shell, a testament to the ingenuity of its creator, can be viewed from four quadrants: the apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The apertural view, a vista that frames the aperture, is the most common, a perspective that reveals the shell in all its glory.\n\nTo count the whorls, one must gaze upon the shell from the apical view, where the first suture begins its journey. A line, a divider, separates the shell into two parts, and the whorls are counted, estimated to a quarter of a turn. The aperture, that vulnerable opening, can be traced through time and space, its path a trajectory of growth and change.\n\nThis trajectory, a mathematical formulation, can be represented graphically, a dance of lines and curves that capture the essence of the mollusk's skeletogenesis. And once this formulation is crafted, the parameters can be varied, and the mollusk's growth can be modified, a world of possibilities unfolding like a lotus flower in the sun.",
            "The shadows of mortality hung over the cradles of Indonesia, a specter that refused to be vanquished. For a decade, the numbers had held steady, a grim testament to the unyielding grip of disease and despair. The promise of the Millennium Development Goals, like beacons in the darkness, beckoned to this forsaken land, but the progress was slow, a mere trickle in the face of unyielding need. The targets loomed ahead, a distant mirage on the horizon, as the country struggled to find its footing in the treacherous terrain of child and maternal health.\n\nIn the midst of this desolate landscape, a glimmer of hope flickered to life. The attendance of skilled health workers at births had increased, a modest gain of 72% in a land where tradition and superstition still held sway. Yet, this meager triumph was tainted by the knowledge that many of these birth attendants were but midwives, unversed in the dark arts of medicine, powerless against the crushing forces of hemorrhage that cut short the lives of so many mothers.\n\nThe numbers told a tale of unfulfilled promise. Diarrheal cases in children under five had declined, yet the treatment of these afflictions by health professionals had begun to stagnate, a testament to the feeble state of Indonesia's healthcare infrastructure. The shadows of postnatal care hung over the land, a void that yawned wide, unlit and unforgiving.\n\nThe cesarean section rate, a statistic that hung like a guillotine over the lives of countless women, stood at a paltry 4%, a number that spoke volumes about the limited access to healthcare in this forsaken land. And yet, it was not a uniform rate, a grim reminder of the yawning chasm between the haves and the have-nots. In the cities, the rate stood at 7%, a gaudy display of privilege, while in the rural areas, it teetered at a mere 2%, a stark testament to the cruel indifference of fate.\n\nThe vertical equity gap yawned wide, a chasm that separated the poor from the rich, a gulf that seemed insurmountable. The numbers spoke of a 27% disparity in service utilization, a cruel reminder that access to healthcare was a privilege reserved for the few, a luxury that the many could only dream of. The out-of-pocket costs, a heavy burden that weighed upon the shoulders of the poor, a weight that threatened to crush them beneath its unyielding pressure.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the land in a dark and foreboding shadow, the question hung in the air, a question that seemed to taunt and tease. How to bridge the chasm, to close the yawning void that gaped between the haves and the have-nots? Should Indonesia turn to the siren song of program-specific approaches, a panacea that promised quick fixes and easy answers, or should it instead strengthen the frail and faltering health system, a system that seemed to be on the brink of collapse?\n\nThe allure of vertical approaches, with their targeted objectives and manageable outcomes, was strong, a seductive siren's call that beckoned to the weary and the worn. Yet, the drawbacks were clear, a warning sign that screamed of the dangers of a myopic focus. The diversion of resources, the siphoning off of funds and personnel, the duplication of services, and the paperwork, a tangled web of bureaucracy that threatened to strangle the very life from the system.\n\nIn the end, it was a choice between a quick fix and a long-term solution, between a band-aid and a cure. The fate of Indonesia's children and mothers hung in the balance, a fragile thread that seemed to tremble in the wind, a thread that threatened to snap at any moment, plunging the land into an abyss of despair.",
            "In the labyrinthine world of Victorian fiction, a peculiarity exists where two novels dare to diverge from the conventions of their time. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, two works often regarded as outliers, weave a tapestry of mystery and the unknown. These aberrations from the norm imbue their characters with an aura of enigma, allowing the reader to glimpse the hidden recesses of their psyche, where motives and emotions reside.\n\nAs the darkness closed in around Oliver Twist, a maelstrom of confusion swept through his mind. The echoes of Sikes and Crackit's contentious voices still lingered, their words seared into his memory like a branding iron. And then, without warning, the sound of gunfire shattered the air, a cacophony of chaos that lifted him up and bore him away. In the tumult, a searing pain gnawed at his consciousness, an undefined ache that refused to subside.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dreamlike sequences serve as a window into the protagonist's tortured soul. The shooting that nearly claimed his life is revisited in a vivid, nightmarish recollection, where the lines between reality and fantasy blur. As he searches for respite, Oliver's senses are numbed, his body a vessel for the unseen forces that propelled him through the streets. The pain, once a shock, had become a constant companion, its grip tightening with every passing moment. In this state of abject despair, the question lingers: whose hand had guided Oliver's fate, for it was certainly not his own? The shooting serves as a potent reminder of his powerlessness, a growing sense of defeat that had been sown by the relentless drumbeat of Fagin's cruelty.\n\nThe day passed, a fleeting whisper of existence, a moment's pause between the darkness that preceded and the darkness that followed. Night descended, a shroud that wrapped around the world, its silence oppressive, its brevity a cruel mockery. The hours ticked by, each one a slow march towards the abyss, as the shadows deepened and the silence grew.",
            "In the brutal light of a bygone afternoon, I recall a boy named Adrian, his small form huddled over a primer, his eyes cast down upon the page as if searching for some hidden truth. I had been tasked with his tutelage, guiding him through the labyrinthine passages of English, a language that for him was as foreign as the stars that shone in the desert night. His struggles were peculiar, a jarring discord that echoed through the halls of the after-school program. Some letters danced upon his tongue with ease, while others recoiled in terror, their pronunciation a cacophony that rent the air. His mother, a woman of unyielding resolve, walked in upon me, her eyes flashing with a language I could not understand, a tongue that was alien to my ears. Our halting conversation was a dance of gestures and fumbling words, a fragile thread that bound us together.\n\nAnd then, like a revelation from the heavens, it struck me: Adrian's reading troubles lay not in comprehension, but in the very alphabet itself. The English language, a behemoth that towered over him like a colossus, seemed to mock his every attempt. I fear that my feeble efforts did little to aid him, but I hope that he has since found solace in the written word.\n\nI speak of this tale to highlight the insidious presence of the language barrier, a specter that haunts the halls of learning, particularly in the sun-kissed lands of California. It is a problem that masquerades as a straightforward issue, but in reality, it is a Gordian knot that defies easy solution. Even the most fluent of speakers can find themselves lost in the labyrinth of the written word. I propose that we abandon the simplistic thinking that has thus far dominated our approach. Tutoring, immersion, ESL classes, and bilingual programs are all piecemeal solutions, a patchwork quilt that fails to address the underlying issue.\n\nThe dual language system, a notion that has been shunned by some as a frivolous indulgence, holds the key to unlocking the doors of understanding. Research has shown that children who participate in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers, their academic prowess a testament to the power of language. The fear that surrounds this idea – that it is a waste of resources, a luxury that only a select few can afford – is nothing but a myth. If we were to adopt this approach as the norm, rather than the exception, the benefits would be felt by all. But how do we accomplish this? Do we require our teachers to be bilingual, a demand that is both unreasonable and unrealistic? No, I propose that we provide them with the tools they need, bilingual assistants, tutors, and aids who can bridge the gap between languages.",
            "In the earliest hours of our existence, a whispered truth has been imparted upon us: that there exists a presence beyond our mortal grasp, a thing that defies comprehension. The devout seek answers in hushed tones within the confines of temple or pulpit, while others search within the labyrinthine corridors of their own minds. Many cling to the creeds bequeathed to them by their forebears, yet others reject them outright, convinced that the universe is a singular, self-contained entity. And so we wander, each of us forging our own path in the pursuit of spiritual understanding, driven by an unquenchable thirst for meaning in a world shrouded in darkness.\n\nAs I recall, my father's gaze would often drift out into the void, his eyes a window to the depths of his soul. It was a look that spoke of remembrance and longing, a look that seemed to both seek and eschew connection. The rain pounded against the tin roof above us, a relentless drumbeat that underscored the weight of our silence. We sat on the creaking porch, the air thick with the acrid smoke of our cigarettes, the gutters spilling forth a deluge that drowned the parched earth. His frame had grown gaunt, his skin sallow, his hair thinned to a sparse veil. He stared out into the rain, avoiding my gaze, and I felt a hollow sense of desolation, a feeling that our words would only serve to make the ache more palpable. So I reached out, wrapped my arms around him, and drew closer, our eyes fixed on the rain-soaked world beyond.\n\nIt was December when he finally succumbed, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, buying time that neither he nor I could fully grasp. And as I lay in the darkness, I found myself questioning the benevolence of a deity who could ordain such a fate. The shadows closed in around me, and I whispered no prayers, for if a god existed, I believed it had long since turned a deaf ear to my pleas. \n\nI had not wished to bear witness to his passing, to watch as the spark that animated him flickered out. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he had become. I knew him better than they did, better than his kin, and I knew that he would not have wanted me to be a spectator to his final moments. I retreated into myself, curled into a ball, and waited for the news that would shatter the fragile silence. But even that comfort was denied me, for no one came to break the stillness.\n\nThe darkness lingered, a heavy blanket that suffocated me, as I waited.",
            "In the crepuscular twilight of literary history, the Gothic novel emerges, a paradoxical union of the antique and the modern. This oxymoronic marriage, as Ian Watt so astutely observed, gives rise to a genre both bereft and beguiling. The Gothic mode has been reviled, extolled, and reviled once more, accused of being a shallow masquerade, yet lauded for its capacity to evoke the \"terrible sublime.\" The foundational text, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, serves as a crucible, fusing the residues of medieval romances and the nascent stirrings of the modern novel. Walpole's Gothic narrative, a deliberate amalgam of \"old\" theatrical conceits and \"new\" narrative innovations, yields a singular beast, a \"Gothic Story\" that defies categorization.\n\nIn the fluid, protean realm of the Gothic, the boundaries between past and present, high and low, blur and dissolve. The genre's roots lie in the decaying, gothicized architecture of medieval theatre, its traditions and tropes endlessly revisited and reinterpreted. The word \"gothic,\" a term once freighted with associations of archaism and unsophistication, had long been employed to describe various peoples, styles, and epochs. Yet, it was precisely this syncretic quality, this willingness to blend and blur, that allowed the Gothic to endure, to become both anachronistic and perennially relevant to readers situated in disparate temporalities.\n\nChivalry, that vaunted ideal of the medieval knight, holds a significant place within the Gothic canon. Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a text born of turmoil and disillusionment, idealizes and romanticizes the chivalric code, that mirage of honor, bravery, and competence. Through its deployment of chivalric motifs and manners, the Gothic past is reimagined as a lost Eden, a golden age of moral certainties and unblemished virtue. This nostalgic impulse, a yearning for a bygone era, serves as a counterpoint to the perceived decay and corruption of the present. In Walpole's writing, the character of Frederic embodies this chivalric ideal, his description replete with traditional epicurean flourishes: a prince, a sufferer, a wanderer, and a martyr, his very existence a testament to the allure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight.\" The excesses of his character, a deliberate exaggeration of the chivalric type, introduce the Gothic trope of the excessive, a note that would resound throughout the genre.",
            "In the hardscrabble expanse of commerce, a labyrinthine process unfolds, a serpentine path of goods from the primal sources of raw materials to the anxious hands of the customer. This is the supply chain, a ceaseless dance of production, supply, and distribution, a grand ballet of movement and purpose. The term supply chain management, a concept forged in the crucible of modern industry, owes its existence to the keen insight of Keith Oliver, a sage counselor to the captains of commerce. In 1982, Oliver illuminated the contours of this intricate process, a harmonious marriage of planning, implementation, and control, all aimed at satisfying the capricious whims of the customer in a world where time is a luxury.\n\nSix elemental pillars support this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The masters of the corporate realm utilize these foundations to construct a bulwark of customer satisfaction, a fortress of service that rises above the din of competition. But at the heart of this grand endeavor lies production, the inaugural step in the supply chain's gestation. Here, the when, why, where, and how of creation are coaxed into being, a delicate waltz of planning and execution. The managers' first task is to divine the desires of the customer, to listen to the whispers of the market, that capricious mistress who holds the keys to the kingdom of demand.\n\nThe market, a vast and unforgiving expanse, holds the secrets of the customer's heart, and it is here that the managers must seek guidance. Once the market's intentions are deciphered, the managers can proceed to shape the contours of production, deciding what products shall be created, in what quantities, and where they shall be forged. The location of production, a critical juncture in the supply chain's trajectory, must balance the competing demands of volume and quality, a tightrope walk of logistics and strategy. And so, the managers toil, their every decision a calculated gamble in the high-stakes game of commerce.\n\nThe scheduling of workloads, the maintenance of equipment, and the precise calibration of production all conspire to create a symphony of efficiency, a finely tuned machine that can withstand the vicissitudes of the market. For in the world of supply chain management, every detail is a vital thread in the intricate tapestry of success. A misstep, a miscalculation, can have far-reaching consequences, a ripple effect that can cost a company dearly in the long run.\n\nConsider, if you will, the retail behemoths of Wal-Mart and Target, those titans of the corporate world, whose every move is a calculated exercise in precision. Their systems, a labyrinthine network of processes and protocols, a finely honed instrument of commerce, allow them to navigate the treacherous waters of supply chain management with ease. The employee's uniform, a symbol of corporate identity, is but one small part of this grand design, a testament to the power of planning and anticipation.\n\nSupply, the second pillar of the supply chain, is a realm of strategic decision-making, a high-stakes game of chess where the pawns are facilities and partnerships. A company's core capabilities, its very identity, are forged in the crucible of supply, where the manager must decide which divisions of production are best suited to the task at hand. And when the decision is made to outsource, to partner with other companies, the aim is clear: to create velocity, to achieve that elusive balance of quality, flexibility, and cost. For in the world of supply chain management, velocity is the holy grail, the unattainable goal that drives the company forward, ever onward, into the unknown.",
            "A weathered cardboard sign creaked in the wind, its message scrawled in hasty, black letters: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". Ellen Page, a fragile figure, stood alone on a cracked sidewalk, her eyes cast downward as if in supplication. The words on the sign seemed to mock her, a cruel jest in a land where the tyrannical grasp of the junta held sway. Burma, a nation shrouded in the shadows of despotism, had known no other rule since the coup of '62. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting moment of defiance, had kindled in the hearts of its people, but the flames of hope were soon extinguished by the brutal hand of the military.\n\nMonks, their saffron robes a stark contrast to the darkness that enveloped them, had marched into the streets, only to be met with violence and bloodshed. The bodies of the fallen littered the streets, their numbers lost in the abyss of official silence. A Japanese journalist, Kenji Nagai, had paid the ultimate price for bearing witness to the atrocities, his death a grim reminder of the junta's unyielding grip on power.\n\nSuch is the lot of humanity, forever bound to the whims of those who would seek to control and oppress. The desire for absolute rule is an ancient curse, one that has infected the hearts of men since the dawn of civilization. The Roman emperors, gods in their own minds, had claimed dominion over their subjects, while the Japanese emperors were believed to be divine, guiding their people through the darkness of history. And in our own time, the echoes of this madness persist, a chilling refrain that has become all too familiar.\n\nThe ghosts of Tiananmen Square, where protesters had dared to challenge the all-powerful Chinese regime, still lingered, their numbers lost in the void of official reportage. The Rwandan genocide, a systematic slaughter of the innocent, had left an indelible stain on the collective conscience. And the Third Reich, that abomination of Nazi Germany, had shown the world the unspeakable horrors that men could inflict upon one another in the name of power and supremacy.\n\nIn this, our world remains unchanged, a realm of darkness and despair, where the strong prey upon the weak and the voices of the oppressed are drowned out by the cacophony of oppression. The sign on Ellen Page's cardboard, a bleak and haunting reminder of the abyss that yawns before us, serves as a testament to the enduring legacy of humanity's capacity for cruelty and despair.",
            "In the vast expanse of Duke Ellington's legacy, his longevity stands as a testament to the boundless creative fires that burned within him. As a maestro, he wove a tapestry of sound that was at once both intricate and sublime, his pianist's touch a subtle undercurrent that coursed through the very fabric of his compositions. In those selected for this assignment, Ellington's presence on the piano is a whispered promise, a gentle reminder of the masterful hand that guided the orchestra's trajectory.\n\nYet it is in his role as composer that Ellington's true genius shines forth, a rich tapestry of sound that showcased the individual threads of his band members. He crafted the framework for soloists to unfurl their improvisational wings, to soar on the thermals of his carefully orchestrated phrases. The result was a music that danced with the particular style of each player, a symphony of sounds that coalesced into a coherent and original whole.\n\nIn the early work Creole Love Call, Ellington revealed a prophetic vision of the voice as a jazz instrument, a lyre that sang with the raw emotion of the human heart. This bluesy dirge, with its deliberate twelve bars, demonstrated a prescience that would become a hallmark of his career – the ability to complement the unique timbre of his soloists, to coax from them a music that was at once both personal and universal. The piece unfolds in six choruses, each a chapter in the narrative of sound:\n\nThe first chorus, a call and response between voice and reeds, begins with a smooth, melodic tone, only to give way to a rougher, more guttural sound. The second chorus, a muted trumpet solo, elaborates on the basic melody, its blue notes stretching out like a supplicant's plea.\n\nThe third chorus, a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, is backed by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase that is at once both propulsive and hesitant. The fourth chorus, a full-band reprise of the first, features a call and response between the brass and reed sections, a swirling vortex of sound that threatens to consume all in its path.\n\nThe fifth chorus, the climactic peak of the piece, sees the reeds take up the call, their high register piercing the air like a cry of despair. The brass and rhythm sections, in syncopated stop-time, add a rhythmic counterpoint that underscores the emotional intensity of the moment.\n\nThe final chorus returns to the structure of the first, the voice now adopting the growl technique, soloing as an instrument. The tag, a brief coda, features a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, a final, jarring note that hangs in the air like a challenge.\n\nIn this work, Ellington's use of voice as a dimension of tone color is but one example of a stylistic trait that would come to define his oeuvre. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, he would combine his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, coaxing a rich and complementary sound from the call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) would extend these ideas, as Ellington would use Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone, the sound a perfect distillation of the music's driving, irresistible energy.",
            "A gnawing void had long resided within her, a hollowness that defied satiation. It had taken root at the tender age of fourteen, when the world's vast expanse began to unfold before her. Three years had since elapsed, yet the ache persisted, refusing to be sated. Her desires, once fixated on material possessions, had shifted to a yearning for human connection, but none had managed to stir within her a spark of interest. The attentions of suitors had been a comical spectacle, their attempts to woo her a clumsy exercise in futility. She had often found herself lost in introspection, searching for a plausible explanation for this peculiarity, but the theories that arose only served to deepen the mystery.\n\nHer home was a sanctuary, a refuge from the tempests that raged outside. Her parents, tranquil souls, moved through life with an unshakeable calm, their disagreements a rarity. When they did occur, it was usually a result of her unbridled spirit, a force that threatened to upend the equilibrium of their serene existence. Yet, she was a kindred spirit, a paradox of contradictions that drew people to her like moths to flame.\n\nBut today, the stillness was shattered. As she wandered through the rooms, searching for inspiration, a cry pierced the air, followed by the faint murmur of her mother's voice. The kitchen, once a place of warmth and comfort, had become a scene of distress. Her mother lay on the floor, her eyes clouded with pain, her breaths staccato and labored. She rushed to her side, her own heart racing in tandem with her mother's distress. \"Mom... Mom, what's wrong?\" she exclaimed, her voice trembling with concern. Her mother's words tumbled forth in a rush, a jumbled mix of pain and urgency. \"Ow... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The daughter's hand instinctively grasped her mother's, offering what little comfort she could. \"Where can I pick you up, Mom?\" she asked, her voice steady despite the turmoil within. Her mother's directions were fragmented, but the daughter's training had prepared her for this moment. She lifted her mother with a strength born of desperation, her heart aching with every step. The drive to the hospital was a blur, her mind focused solely on her mother's needs.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic atmosphere only served to heighten the sense of unease, but she was oblivious to the fear that clung to her like a shroud. Her sole concern was her mother's well-being. She carried her to the examination room, her voice calling out to the doctors in a steady, urgent tone. The medical staff rushed to her side, their faces etched with concern. A rolling bed was summoned, and her mother was laid upon it, her daughter left to sit, her heart heavy with worry. The diagnosis was a simple one: her mother had fallen from a precarious perch, a stepping stool, while reaching for a vase.",
            "The sun-scorched land of morbidity stretched out before us, a barren expanse of heart disease and stroke that threatened to consume the lives of countless women.  Yet, like a beacon of hope in the desolate wasteland, the Mediterranean Diet stood tall, its virtues extolled by the dusty tomes of science.  The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a measure of adherence to this sacred creed, was found to be inversely linked to the specter of chronic heart disease and stroke, that twin demons that stalked the night, whispering the names of the fallen to the wind.\n\nThis study, a prosaic exercise in the pursuit of knowledge, sought to unravel the mysteries of the aMed diet, a modified variant of the Mediterranean Diet's sacred precepts.  By emphasizing the consumption of plant foods, those verdant denizens of the earth, and eschewing the unwholesome presence of saturated fats, those dark and malevolent forces that seek to destroy, the aMed diet promised a path to redemption.  The inclusion of fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, those pillars of a just diet, served as a bulwark against the ravages of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe ancients had spoken of the Mediterranean Diet's virtues, but this study sought to delve deeper, to pierce the veil of doubt and uncertainty that shrouded the darkness of stroke and stroke mortality.  Prior studies had hinted at the diet's efficacy in vanquishing the specter of cardiovascular mortality, but the silence was broken by the sound of the aMed diet's drumbeat, beating out a rhythm of hope in the hearts of the faithful.\n\nIn the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without the stain of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, a tale of endurance and survival was written.  For twenty years, they walked the path of the aMed diet, their footsteps measured by the self-reported food frequency questionnaires, those pages of parchment that held the secrets of their daily bread.  The validation of these reports, a ritual of fire and purification, was performed by the sacred texts of medical records and death certificates.\n\nYet, even as the darkness gathered, the women of this study stood firm, their resolve unwavering in the face of the void.  Their bodies, measured by the yardstick of body mass index, smoking status, and aspirin use, told a tale of resilience, of a people unbroken by the trials of the aMed diet.  As they walked the path of the diet, their cumulative averages of the aMed score, like the steady beat of a drum, measured out the rhythm of their progress.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a sacred arithmetic of risk and reward, revealed the hidden truths of the aMed diet.  And lo, the women who walked the path of the diet, those who heeded the call of the aMed score, were found to be at lower risk of heart disease and stroke, their footsteps measured by the relative risk quotient.  In the top quintile of the aMed score, a realm of plenty and abundance, the women stood, unbroken and unafraid, their hearts beating to the rhythm of a healthier life.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of the American experience, a calamity unfolded in the year 2007, a year that would come to be known as the nadir of a long descent into economic ruin. The economic behemoths of the nation crumbled beneath the weight of their own hubris, their colossus-like structures tumbling to the ground like the idols they had become. The people suffered, their livelihoods reduced to ashes, their futures incinerated by the very fires of speculation and greed that had fueled the engines of progress.\n\nThe rot that had taken hold ran deep, its roots tracing back to the year 1999, a time when the nation's leaders, blinded by their own ambition, had begun to tamper with the delicate machinery of the economy. The Clinton administration, driven by a hunger for power, had relaxed the reins of restraint, allowing the wolves of speculation to roam free. And so, Fannie Mae, that behemoth of the mortgage industry, was goaded into extending its reach, casting its net far and wide in search of the vulnerable and the gullible. The siren song of easy credit had begun to beckon, and the people, ensnared by the promise of a better life, had answered.\n\nThe warning signs had been there, visible to all who cared to see. In the pages of the New York Times, a prescient voice had sounded the alarm, cautioning against the dangers of a house of cards built on shifting sands. \"Fannie Mae,\" Steven Holmes had written, \"the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" And then, in a phrase that would prove to be a prophecy, he added, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nBut the warnings had fallen on deaf ears, and the economy careened forward, fueled by the toxic fumes of speculation and greed. The new and complex structures of mortgage-backed securities, CDOs, and adjustable-rate mortgages had created a Frankenstein's monster of finance, a creature that had lost all control, its fate sealed. The sectors of the economy had become intertwined, a vast and intricate web of debt and obligation, a house of cards that would soon come crashing down.\n\nAnd down it came, with a crash that shook the very foundations of the nation. The top five U.S. investment banks, once the titans of finance, were brought low, their losses totaling $4.1 trillion, a staggering sum that would leave the nation reeling. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those behemoths of the mortgage industry, stood at the precipice, their combined debt of $5 trillion a weight that threatened to consume them whole. And so, in September 2008, they were brought under government control, a desperate attempt to salvage what was left of the economy.",
            "In the desolate expanse of narrative, there exists a barren stretch known as exposition.  A place where the writer's wings, once poised to take flight, instead falter and wither in the arid air.  The reader, a traveler in this unforgiving land, stumbles upon a wasteland of words, where the magnetic pull of the writer's prose is lost to the void.  Dr. Merlin, a sage guide in this wilderness, is known to bemoan the fate of such passages, her voice rising in frustration as the words blur before her eyes.\n\nExposition, that insidious whisper in the writer's ear, tempts her to reveal the hidden truths, to lay bare the skeletal framework of the story.  But it is a siren's call, luring her down the rocky shores of prose, where the reader's interest founders and the narrative succumbs to the undertow of tedium.\n\nThe familiar mantra, \"Show, don't tell,\" echoes through the halls of writing wisdom, yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in the quagmire of exposition, her words a jumbled mass of information, a cacophony of fact and fiction.  The devil that sits upon her shoulder, urging her to reveal the backstory, the history of the characters' lives, is a constant companion, a shadow that haunts her every move.\n\nTo illustrate the folly of exposition, let us consider a tale of love and loss.  A heroine, her heart aflame with passion, meets her beloved in a moment of time, their love blossoming like a wildflower in the desert.  But their marriage is reduced to a few stilted lines, a cursory nod to the depth of their emotions.  The husband, a man whose love is as vast as the desert itself, is reduced to a mere specter, a fleeting presence in the heroine's life.  His murder, a brutal act that shatters the fragile bonds of their love, is met with a sparse display of emotion, the heroine's grief a mere whisper in the wind.\n\nThe proper rendering of this tale would be to give substance to the bare bones of the narrative.  To show, not tell, the depth of the heroine's emotions, the richness of her love for the husband.  To reveal, through the prism of her eyes, the world that she saw through his, the hopes and dreams that he instilled in her.  Only then, in the midst of this rich tapestry, can the reader truly mourn the loss of the husband, and in doing so, come to know the heroine in all her complexity.\n\nAs writers, we must strive to infuse the narrative with the meat of life, to make the simple storyline a testament to the human experience.  We must eschew the temptation to rush past the nuances of character, to reveal the hidden depths of their souls.  For in the end, it is not the exposition that matters, but the world that we create, the lives we touch, and the emotions we evoke.",
            "The evening sun had long since surrendered to the shadows as I sat transfixed before the glowing rectangle, the hum of the television a morbid serenade. The faces of two local newscasters leered back at me, their words a litany of the day's atrocities. From Columbus, Ohio, the news poured in like a relentless rain, each story a minor tremor in the ongoing earthquake of humanity's worst excesses.\n\nThe first report was a jerky, disjointed thing, a snippet of live broadcast from an earlier morning. A man, Shad Hostettler, his features twisted into a visage of malevolence, stared back at me from the screen. His wife, nameless and faceless, a mere prop in his dark design, had been the target of his madness, her body a canvas for his brutal art. The news anchor's voice droned on, a monotone litany of fact and speculation, before moving on to the next tale of woe.\n\nThe second story, a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, was a cold, clinical thing, devoid of passion or conviction. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, lay critically wounded, his fate a precarious balance of life and death. The authorities, a parade of uniforms and badges, marched in to investigate, their words a hollow promise of justice. But I knew, in that moment, that this story would be but a footnote in the grand tome of human suffering. The victims of a black neighborhood were often forgotten, their stories reduced to a mere whisper, a ghostly echo that faded into the ether.\n\nThe newscasters moved on, their words a blur of indifference, as they spoke of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. The bullet, a .22 caliber pellet from a rifle, had pierced the metal skin of the aircraft, a tiny, insignificant thing in the grand tapestry of the universe. And yet, a reward was offered, a paltry sum of five thousand dollars, a feeble attempt to salve the wound of a community's outrage.\n\nThe forecast, a meandering thing, spoke of rain and thunderstorms, a minor perturbation in the grand dance of the weather. The temperatures, a mere trifle, would remain in the mid-to-low eighties, a trivial concern in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAnd so the newscasters moved on, their words a litany of petty crimes and inconsequential events. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF, a store clerk's tale of a dark-skinned black man, his features a mere caricature, his crime a trivial thing in the grand ledger of humanity's sins. The words dripped with a subtle venom, a subtext that spoke of fear and prejudice, a whispered promise of a world where some lives were worth less than others.\n\nFinally, a convicted man, Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin, was paraded before the camera, his face a mask of defiance. His crime, a conspiracy to distribute marijuana, a trivial thing in the grand scheme of things. His sentence, a mere 300 months, a paltry sum in the face of humanity's vast and unforgiving landscape. And yet, his ethnicity, a Hispanic man, was trotted out, a tired trope, a worn and dusty phrase, a reminder that in this world, some lives were worth less than others.",
            "In the crucible of brotherhood, a bond is forged that cannot be broken, a bond that festers with the contradictions of love and cruelty, of pride and jealousy. It is a bond that allows brothers to see themselves in one another, to behold their own reflection staring back, unflinching and unyielding. And it is in the depths of desperation, when all hope seems lost, that this bond is revealed in all its twisted glory. The consequences of this bond are dire, a reckoning that is paid in full with every cruel thought and every tender gesture.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers embark on a futile journey, their bond tempered by the unforgiving forces of nature. The clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a fever pitch in a climactic moment of truth, leaving only one brother to escape the devastating consequences. Through the eyes of the narrator, we are granted a glimpse into the inner workings of the protagonist's fractured psyche, a world where the lines between love and hatred are blurred beyond recognition.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to the devouring power of pride. From the outset, his relationship with his brother Doodle is marked by resentment, a seething anger that festers in the face of the little boy's crippled form. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who would be his companion in every sense, a partner in adventure and a mirror to his own soul. But Doodle's fragile heart, a constant reminder of the cruel hand that fate had dealt him, was a bitter pill to swallow. The memories of their early days together, of the things they would never do, of the dreams that would never be realized, still lingered, a festering wound that refused to heal.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of this unyielding despair, a glimmer of hope flickered to life. The small boy's smile, a radiant beam of light in a world gone dark, pierced the protagonist's heart, a reminder of the love that lay hidden beneath the surface. It was a love that was not strong enough to conquer the crushing weight of his own desires, but it was enough to stay his hand, to prevent the unforgivable act of infanticide that had lurked in the shadows of his mind. In that moment, the protagonist saw the truth of his own nature, a truth that was both beautiful and brutal, a reflection of the bond that had forged him into the person he was.",
            "The human brain - a labyrinthine repository of circuitry and cognition, its workings as inscrutable as the dark recesses of the earth.  As the machinery of technology has advanced, so too have the metaphors we employ to grasp its essence.  We once conceived of the brain as a wax tablet, receiving impressions of the world like the soft, yielding surface of a page.  Later, it was likened to a papyrus scroll, unrolled and inscribed with the intricate hieroglyphics of thought.  And more recently, we have come to see it as a calculating device, a machine of cold efficiency, processing data with the speed and precision of a well-oiled automaton.  Yet these analogies, though clever, are ultimately feeble attempts to capture the fullness of its mystery.\n\nInformation, a constant influx of sensory impressions - the tactile caress of the sun on skin, the cacophony of sound that assaults the eardrums, the photons that dance across the retina - is transformed, transmuted by the brain's dark alchemy into a language of electrical signals that course through its tangled network like a river through the desert.  This machinery of perception is a double-edged sword, cutting both ways: on one hand, the bottom-up process, a slow and laborious assembly of the most basic components - color, shape, texture - into a coherent whole; on the other, the top-down process, a swift and intuitive leap, guided by the accumulated wisdom of past experiences, to a recognition that is both instantaneous and profound.\n\nBut even as the information is processed, an unseen hand, the attention filter, intervenes, deciding what is worthy of notice, what is to be set aside, and what is to be forgotten.  It is a gatekeeper, a sentinel that stands at the threshold of awareness, admitting only what is deemed necessary, rejecting the rest.  Thus, in the midst of a riotous din, we may pluck out the melody of our own name, a thread of meaning that stands out against the tapestry of dissonance.\n\nAnd yet, for all its seeming complexity, the brain's basic function - the storage of information - is a simple, yet profound one.  There are the three levels of memory: the sensory, a fleeting impression, a snapshot of the moment; the working, a delicate dance of electrical signals that shimmers and fades like a firefly in the night; and the long-term, a repository of knowledge, a library of the past, where the accumulated wisdom of centuries is inscribed upon the walls of the mind.\n\nThe models of how this knowledge is organized are legion, each one a reflection of our own imperfect understanding of the brain's labyrinthine depths.  Some are based on the human experience, a map of memories etched upon the surface of the mind; others, on the cold, unforgiving logic of computer science; and others, on the twitching, electrical impulses that course through the body.  And yet, no matter the model, the truth remains elusive, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons us deeper into the darkness, deeper into the heart of the human brain.",
            "In the desolate landscape of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley's scathing critique of the forthcoming specter of technology and the fetid underbelly of capitalism unfurls like a dark tapestry. This dystopian world, where the masses toil in servitude to the dictates of the World Controller, is a testament to the pernicious effects of a system that values conformity above the solitary flame of individuality. From the very inception, the inhabitants are indoctrinated with a numbing mantra of hedonistic pleasure, their desires tempered by the stultifying hand of conditioning. Beneath this façade, a more sinister reality lurks, where the common folk are reduced to pawns in a grand game of ideological manipulation.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist dialectics, Huxley's masterpiece reveals the undercurrents of suspicion towards the burgeoning economy of his time. The pervasive use of terms like homogeny and reification serves as a testament to the author's unease with the emerging order. The specter of capitalism looms large, its true nature obscured by the smokescreen of false consciousness. Like a thief in the night, it steals the proletariat's awareness of their own condition, rendering them mute and acquiescent to the whims of their betters.\n\nThe lower echelons of society, the Deltas and Gammas, are reduced to automatons, their wills supplanted by the insidious whisper of hypnopædia, which exhorts them to indulge, to consume, to surrender to the void. And at the helm of this charnel house, the World Controller reigns supreme, a master puppeteer manipulating the strings of the masses. Hegemony, that insidious force that reduces social classes to a mere plaything of the powerful, holds sway in this bleak world, where the lower classes are complicit in their own oppression, their very existence a testament to the efficacy of the system.\n\nIn this world devoid of passion, of true connection, of genuine relationships, Huxley reveals the sterile, loveless existence that arises from the marriage of technology and capitalism. The characters, once they attempted to be flesh and blood, now reduced to cardboard cutouts, their interactions a hollow mockery of human connection. Their words, a litany of shallow trivialities, a paean to the vacuous idol of physical appearance. And in the societal classes' complete acceptance of their station, we see the Marxian thesis of the proletariat's false consciousness writ large, a testament to the insidious power of the system to reduce humanity to a mere abstraction, a cog in the machine of oppression.",
            "The dusty expanse of University Park has been my domain for nigh on two and a half years now, a score of semesters creeping by like dark hours in the night. For many, the very notion of navigating its twisting paths and broad thoroughfares is a Sisyphean task. I recall my earliest days, lodged in the dormitory of East Halls, a distant outpost on the farthest rim of the campus, the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center looming like sentinels beyond the horizon. The trek from my humble abode in Stuart Hall to the hallowed halls of Willard, a bastion of learning situated at the very heart of the campus, would often consume a quarter of an hour, the rain-soaked streets and wind-whipped leaves conspiring to slow my progress. And yet, I was not alone in my plight. A chance encounter with a seasoned alumnus, a man not many years my elder, revealed to me a tale of yore, a time when the East Halls stood isolated, ringed by a vast expanse of vacant land. The years have passed, and that desolate terrain has given way to a tapestry of sports fields, grand edifices, and apartments, a sprawling metropolis that has only served to heighten the sense of disconnection. As the campus continues to sprawl, the very fabric of our daily lives becomes increasingly enmeshed in the struggle to traverse its length and breadth. In this wilderness of pavement and steel, the humble bicycle stands as a beacon of hope, a means of locomotion that transcends the limitations of foot and wheel. But alas, the bike itself is a mere tool, a mere instrument, and it is the will of the rider that must be steeled to wield it. The campus, too, must be reshaped to accommodate the needs of its two-wheeled citizens.\n\nI chanced upon a friend, a man who had recently rediscovered the joys of cycling after a protracted absence. His words still linger in my mind: \"Bikes are a revelation,\" he said, his voice laced with a hint of wonder. \"For a time, it wasn't fashionable to ride, but now I see it as the only reasonable way to traverse this vast expanse.\" And indeed, the bicycle offers a clarity of purpose that is hard to find in the hurly-burly of daily life. A simple bowl of oatmeal and the gentle toil of pedaling can carry one farther than the eye can see. I, too, have found myself bound to the campus's periphery, a captive of the off-campus world. And yet, the acquisition of a bike has proven to be a stroke of wisdom, a decision that has shaved precious minutes from my daily routine. The Thomas building, a bastion of learning and knowledge, lies within easy cycling distance, a mere five minutes from my doorstep, should I pedal with haste. Alas, the road that stretches between my home and my destination, Pollock Road, is a pathway fraught with peril, a serpentine course that twists and turns through the heart of the campus. It is a route that tests the mettle of even the most resolute cyclist. And yet, it is a path I must tread, for without my bike, the only alternative would be a pedestrian's plodding pace, a journey that would consume a full half-hour, nay, an hour, of my precious time. The arithmetic is stark: an additional two and a half hours each week, lost in the mire of walking, a sum that I can ill afford."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The pursuit of a profession in social work beckons like a siren's call, drawing me to the shadows of a world where the vulnerable are preyed upon by the very ones who should protect them. It is a world where the tender shoots of childhood are withered by the cruel hand of abuse, where the fragile bonds of family are rent asunder by the weight of neglect. And yet, it is a world I feel compelled to enter, to walk among the broken and the bereft, to offer what solace I can.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, certain values stand as beacons of hope: service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of relationships, both between individuals and within oneself. These are not ideals to be lightly considered; they are the very threads that weave the tapestry of a life worth living. I have walked among the ruins of others' lives, witnessed the desperation and the despair that can drive even the strongest to flee from their problems, to deny the darkness that follows them. And I have seen the frailty of those who turn to coping mechanisms that only serve to perpetuate their suffering.\n\nIt was in the midst of such a scene, one summer's day, that I chanced upon a young boy, his eyes wide with fear, his soul beset by the cruelty of those who should have protected him. I watched as he fled, as he sought refuge in the arms of a friend, and I knew then that I had to act. I had to take a stand, to offer what little I could to stem the tide of his suffering. And so, I spoke out, my words falling like a stone into a still pond, ripples of consequence spreading outward, touching the lives of all who heard them.\n\nBut it was not until I faced the parents, their eyes darting back and forth like trapped animals, that I understood the true nature of the darkness that had taken hold. They denied, they rationalized, they blamed the victim for the pain they had inflicted. And in that moment, I knew that I had to dedicate my life to the fight against such cruelty, to the defense of the vulnerable, to the pursuit of justice for the forgotten.\n\nSocial justice, that great and elusive ideal, beckons to me still. It is a call to arms, a clarion cry that echoes through the chambers of my heart. I have protested, I have spoken out against the injustices that I have seen, against the petty cruelties that masquerade as tradition, against the suffocating weight of conformity that seeks to stifle the unique voice of the individual. I have worn my hair in colors that defy the norm, I have pierced my skin with symbols of my defiance, I have stood shoulder to shoulder with those who would be marginalized, and I have spoken out against the systemic cruelties that seek to silence the voice of the oppressed.\n\nIn this, I am not alone. For in a world that claims to value the individual, yet seeks to crush their every step, I am a part of a long line of rebels, of outcasts, of those who would challenge the status quo and seek a world where the vulnerable are protected, where the marginalized are lifted up, and where the individual is free to be themselves, unencumbered by the weight of expectation.",

The orexin neurons, those subtle agents of slumber, contain within them the seeds of our very somnolence. The activation of the GABAB receptor, a receptor whose very presence is a testament to the intricate ballet of our internal workings, induces responses that promote the surrender to sleep. And yet, its inhibition, a mere whisper in the darkness, can conjure forth a reduction in anxiety, a stilling of the turbulent mind.\n\nThe mice, those creatures of curious observation, have been used to shed light upon this phenomenon. In the sterile confines of the laboratory, scientists have discovered that the phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons hold the key to our very ability to slumber. The administration of baclofen, a GABAB agonist, has been shown to prolong the duration of sleep, a testament to the subtle yet potent influence of this receptor. The implications of this study are far-reaching, speaking as they do to the very essence of our humanity. For if the genetic and environmental factors that shape our GABAB receptor are disrupted, the consequences are dire indeed. Our ability to rest, to find solace in the darkness, is compromised. And with it, the very fabric of our lives is rent asunder.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are far-reaching, a reminder that our struggles with insomnia are not solely the province of the individual. They are a testament to the complex interplay of our biology and our environment. The whisper of our genetic makeup, the sigh of our circumstances, all conspire to shape our experience of the world. And it is in this darkness, this void of sleep, that we find ourselves lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.",
            "In the depths of the mind, a chasm lies, a void that separates the external world from the inner recesses of comprehension. This is the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, a condition where the brain's ability to decipher the whispers of the world is lost. It is not a deficiency of hearing, but rather a aberration in the labyrinthine corridors of the central nervous system. The brain, that great organ of perception, falters in its duty to translate the cacophony of sounds into a coherent language of meaning. The sufferer may hear the words, but they remain a jumble of discordant notes, a symphony without melody or harmony.\n\nThe earliest whispers of this disorder emerged in the mid-century, a faint murmur of awareness that would grow into a crescendo of understanding. Researchers, like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, ventured into the uncharted territories of the mind, developing tests to navigate the unexplored landscapes of the brain. Kimura's work in 1961, a pioneering effort to unlock the secrets of dichotic perception, marked a turning point in the understanding of this enigmatic disorder.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are as varied as the sands of the desert. The afflicted may struggle to pinpoint the source of a sound, to distinguish between the competing demands of the environment. They may falter in the face of conflicting aural stimuli, their brain unable to synthesize the discrete elements into a coherent whole. They may fail to recognize the patterns that govern the world, the rhythms and cadences that govern the flow of human interaction. They may be unable to discern the nuances of speech, the subtle shifts in tone and inflection that convey meaning and emotion. And they may be lost in the sequence of events, unable to grasp the temporal relationships that underlie the world's unfolding drama.\n\nDiagnosis, a process fraught with uncertainty, requires a nuanced understanding of the patient's inner workings. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists must navigate the labyrinthine corridors of the mind, using a variety of tools to probe the depths of the sufferer's auditory world. They must observe the patient's responses to stimuli, the way they navigate the complexities of sound and silence. And they must interpret the data, sifting through the noise to uncover the underlying patterns that govern the sufferer's perception.\n\nNo single test can claim a high rate of diagnostic success, and the underlying causes of the disorder remain shrouded in mystery. But the pursuit of understanding continues, driven by the insatiable curiosity of researchers and clinicians. They probe the depths of the mind, seeking to illuminate the dark recesses of the brain, to unlock the secrets of this enigmatic disorder and to offer hope to those who suffer from its ravages.",
            "The veil of deception, a shroud that shrouds the soul, threatens to consume all in its path. Twelfth Night whispers a haunting truth: that the art of disguise, though a potent tool for deception, ultimately demands a reckoning. To remain hidden is to risk losing oneself, forever entombed in a prison of one's own making. The price of unmasking is steep: alienation, a chasm that yawns wide between the self and those who once knew us. We are forced to choose between the preservation of our own essence and the fragile bonds that tie us to others. And yet, how many of us will find solace in the neutrality of strangers, rather than the vitriol of those who once called us friend?\n\nIn the realm of gender, the masquerade assumes a particularly sinister form. What drives us to don the disguise of another, to abandon the fragile shell of our own identity? Viola's tale is a testament to the primal urge for self-protection, a desperate bid to survive in a world where the strong devour the weak. \"I'll lead you to a captain in this town,\" she says, \"where my maiden's weeds lie, and by whose gentle aid I was preserved to serve this noble count\" (5.1.247-249). In the unforgiving landscape of a foreign land, Viola assumes a masculine guise, a ruse that shields her from the ravages of those who would seek to do her harm. But in doing so, she sacrifices the very connections that might have sustained her, severing the ties that bind her to her own kind.\n\nHer ruse is so convincing that it ensnares even those who know her not, including the lovesick Olivia, who confuses her with her own brother, Sebastian. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). And yet, Viola's disguise also reignites the smoldering embers of her own desires, as she finds herself torn between the affections of Orsino and the unrequited passion that burns within her. \"Boy, thou hast told me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261). Thus, Twelfth Night becomes a curious case study in the alchemy of deception, where the hidden truths of the heart are forced into the light.\n\nBut is this merely a testament to the liberating power of self-discovery, or a commentary on the societal constraints that bind us? Does Olivia's ardor for Cesario betray a deeper longing for a world beyond the narrow bounds of her own desires, or is it simply a reflection of the prurient gaze that society casts upon those who dare to be different? The evidence suggests the latter, as she effortlessly transfers her affections to Sebastian, and regards Cesario/Viola as a sibling, rather than a love interest. \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315). In this, we see a wry mockery of the very society that sought to constrain her, a world where judgment is meted out based on the superficial trappings of appearance rather than the depths of the soul.",
            "In the vast expanse of German colonial rule, a stark reality emerged - one of brutality, a darkness that shrouded the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. To reduce this monstrosity to a simple label would be a travesty, a disservice to the complexities that defined the empire. Like the shifting dunes of the desert that stretched across its territories, the German colonial empire was a tapestry of varied policies and governance, a geography as unforgiving as it was diverse. The provision of education, too, was a patchwork of disparate threads, each colony weaving its own unique narrative.\n\nWhen the British claimed German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a population of Africans who possessed a certain... refinement, a literacy that spoke to the efforts of the Germans. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational endeavors were lauded by the chroniclers of the time. Yet, South West Africa presented a haunting contrast, a desolate landscape where the task of educating the natives was left to the benevolence of missionary societies, which received meager support from the government. And yet, the government lavished resources upon the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and regulating the missionary institutions with an iron hand. These policies would leave an indelible mark on South West Africa, a legacy that would persist long after the German rule had faded into memory. While other colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained a bastion of ignorance, a place where the overwhelming majority of its people remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. The reasons for this divergence were complex, a tangled web of social, political, and economic factors that would prove resistant to easy explanation. This paper seeks to untangle these threads, to shed light upon the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans, and to illuminate the path that led to this divergent experience.\n\nA plethora of literature exists on the subject of education in the German colonial empire, a vast and often daunting corpus that stretches across languages and historical periods. Much of this work is in German, a tongue that spoke to the hearts of the colonizers, and was penned during or shortly after the period of German rule. The early writings were concerned primarily with describing the educational systems of the various colonies, a cataloging of the disparate ways in which the Germans sought to educate the natives. Later works, penned in English, expanded the discourse, comparing the educational systems of the different colonies and subjecting them to a more nuanced analysis. Among these studies, Cohen's work stands out, a comprehensive examination of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen's study seeks to explain the differences between the two colonies, and identifies the large settler population of South West Africa as a key factor in shaping its educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, a land of contrasts, where the desert sands gave way to temperate climates, and the European population grew in tandem with the relative hospitability of the territory. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, a number dwarfed only by the settler population of East Africa, where 5,336 Europeans resided.",
            "In the shadow of a century, popular music has sprawled forth like a twisted labyrinth, its paths beset on all sides by an impenetrable thicket of genres. The very fabric of this music has been rent asunder by an endless proliferation of sub-genres, each one a splintered offshoot of its predecessor, a maddening proliferation that threatens to consume all in its path. And within this maelstrom, heavy metal stands as a behemoth, its dark and tortured form twisting and writhing like a living thing.\n\nBorn of the desperation and disillusionment of a bygone era, heavy metal has given rise to a thousand divergent strains, each one a fevered attempt to capture the essence of the music's dark and primal heart. It is a music of excess, a cacophonous tapestry woven from threads of volume, velocity, and sheer, unadulterated fury. The metal musician is a virtuoso, a technician of sound, his hands moving with a precision and speed that belies the chaotic, anarchic nature of the music itself.\n\nAnd yet, it is in the darkness that heavy metal finds its truest expression. The music is a reflection of the abyss that stares back at us from the mirror, a void that yawns open its maw and devours all in its path. It is a music born of the night, of the shadows that dance upon the wall, of the secrets that we dare not speak aloud. The Romantic era's dark, visceral legacy haunts the music, a ghostly presence that whispers secrets in the ears of the initiated.\n\nConsider the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\", a song that trembles with the aftershocks of a revolution yet to come. A response to the Rolling Stones' own dark and heavy incantations, it is a declaration of intent, a statement of purpose that announces the arrival of a new era in music. The darkness that seethes within its lyrics is a darkness that cannot be contained, a maelstrom of emotions that threatens to consume all in its path.\n\nIn this music, we find the twisted, nightmarish landscape of the human condition, a world of darkness and despair that stares back at us from the mirror. It is a music that defies categorization, a hydra-headed monstrosity that cannot be pinned down or contained. And yet, it is precisely this quality that has given rise to its enduring power, a power that continues to fascinate and terrify us to this day.",
            "In the somnambulant haze that precedes the stirrings of the surrealist dawn, an artist dwelled, his brushstrokes whispering secrets to the canvas. Henri Rousseau, a man beset by the specter of uncertainty, tortured by the demons of his own ambition. His masterpiece, The Dream, born in 1910, a testament to the turmoil that gnawed at his very soul. For in its ethereal landscapes and dreamlike visions, Rousseau poured out his deepest longings: the desire for recognition, for acceptance, for the validation of his craft by the very art world he revered.\n\nBut the path to such accolades was fraught with peril. Rousseau's journey was one of self-doubt and struggle, a Sisyphean effort to reconcile the artist within with the conventions without. To conform, to mimic the styles of his contemporaries, or to forge his own path, to stumble through the wilderness of his own creativity? The internal battle raged on, a maelstrom of conflicting desires that threatened to consume him whole.\n\nTo comprehend The Dream, one must delve into the labyrinthine corridors of Rousseau's biography. Born on a fateful May day in 1844, in the town of Laval, he was the son of a tinsmith, a man of modest means, blessed with a bourgeois prosperity that would prove a double-edged sword. No formal training in the arts, only the rough-hewn tools of a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, to guide his early years. The burden of his grief, the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, weighed heavily upon him, leaving only a daughter, Julia, to inherit his name. And so, in the midst of such sorrow, he turned to painting, a tentative step into the unknown, a quest for solace and redemption.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's brushstrokes spoke to the common man, a folk painter, unbridled by the conventions of the art world. His obsession with acceptance, a fire that burned bright, was a testament to his unyielding desire to be seen, to be heard, to be acknowledged. And yet, in the shadow of greatness, he toiled, his works lost in the annals of time, until the arrival of Matisse, a painter of a different ilk, driven by a different passion, a different purpose. As Jan Gordon so astutely observed, Rousseau's quest was one of seeking the mundane, the conventional, the trite, in order to be admitted to the rarefied world of the Artiste Français, while Matisse, on the other hand, strove to avoid the banal, to transcend the ordinary.",
            "In the depths of our existence, a mystic bond weaves itself between the threads of ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. It is a connection that has been posited by the great thinkers, a notion that cannot be easily unraveled. John Keats' words, like a whispered secret, echo through the ages: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" For in the marrow of our being, we sense the inextricable tie between the two, a bond that cannot be forged through the hammer of reason or the chisel of experience. We are drawn to it, like moths to the flame, without the need for instruction or tuition.\n\nOur understanding of the world is forged in fire and stone, a tapestry woven from the threads of knowledge and experience. Yet, we are drawn to the realm of ethics and aesthetics with a singular passion, a yearning that defies explanation. We seek to grasp the essence of what is beautiful, to pin down the unnamable, like a moth in the spider's web. But it is a pursuit that is doomed to fail, for in the world of art and morality, there is a limit to language, a horizon beyond which we cannot tread.\n\nConsider the Mona Lisa, that enigmatic smile, a riddle wrapped in a mystery. We may prattle on about the nuances of light and shadow, the play of perspective and contrast, but in the end, it is not these things that capture the essence of her beauty. When we are asked to describe what draws us to a work of art or literature, we falter, our words reduced to the feeble phrase, \"There's just something about it.\" It is a confession, a recognition that there are some truths that cannot be spoken, only felt.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's words come to mind: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" In the same way, ethics has a language that defies the tongue, a language that speaks directly to the heart. As the great philosopher said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this unnamable quality, this je ne sais quoi, that is the very essence of art and morality, the thread that weaves them together.\n\nWe experience both art and morality at a level that is both seen and unseen, a realm that lies beyond the reach of language. It is a connection that is strongest in literature, where the art of storytelling becomes a reflection of the human condition. As McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" In the end, it is this congruence that makes literature so vital, so essential to our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.",
            "The Germany of today, a land forged in the crucible of its storied past, stands as a testament to the indomitable will of its people. From the snow-capped peaks of the Alps to the unforgiving shores of the Baltic, the nation's roots run deep, a testament to the primordial forces that have shaped its culture. In the cities of München and Kiel, where the Rhine and Elbe rivers converge, a unique tapestry of traditions has unfolded, a rich brocade woven from the threads of distant tribes and forgotten eras.\n\nThe shadow of Germania looms large, a land of ancient mystery, its name shrouded in dispute among the scholars and sages of old. Some claim it arose from the Tungrians, a long-forgotten tribe, their identity lost to the sands of time. Others whisper that it was Julius Caesar who first coined the term, a distinction born of his wars against the Gauls, a people whose language and customs he sought to understand. In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Caesar penned a glimpse into the Germanic tribes, their ceaseless battles with the Gauls a testament to their unyielding spirit. \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine,\" he wrote, \"with whom they are continually waging war...They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)\n\nThe spear, that potent symbol of their warrior culture, has been proposed as the source of their name, a fierce and primal instrument of war that has left an indelible mark on the annals of history. Others point to the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" a testament to the Germans' unbridled passion and unwavering ferocity. And yet, the truth remains elusive, lost in the mists of time, a mystery waiting to be unraveled.\n\nTacitus, that master chronicler of the ancient world, penned a paean to the Germans in his De Origine et situ Germanorum, a sweeping narrative that revealed the secrets of their origins. \"I should regard them,\" he wrote, \"as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd so, the Germans remained, a people apart, their isolation a testament to their unyielding will. They traded with the Romans, serving in their legions, their skills forged in the furnace of battle. Yet, they remained aloof, a people unto themselves, their culture a unique and enigmatic blend of tradition and innovation. In the shadows of the Roman Empire, they waited, their patience a testament to their unyielding resolve. And when the time came, they emerged, a force to be reckoned with, their indomitable spirit forged in the crucible of their storied past. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "My gaze fell upon the scene before me, a canvas of desolation, a tableau of unassuming ordinariness. My mind, a void, a chasm, a hollow vessel, stirred with the weight of observation but refused to anchor itself to any abstract understanding, any framework of thought. The world, a tapestry of detail, unfolded before me, a vast and unyielding expanse of color and form, yet my consciousness remained detached, a fluid, unmoored thing, aware of the moment without attachment.\n\nA book, a dusty relic of a bygone era, lay on a shelf, its pages yellowed with age. 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain', a title that held a certain allure, a promise of secrets revealed, of hidden truths unveiled. An artist, a mentor, a guide, had counseled me to seek out this tome, to unlock the mysteries of the creative process. I had always been drawn to the act of creation, the thrill of bringing forth something from nothing. And so, with a sense of trepidation, I embarked upon this journey, a path that wound through the labyrinth of the human experience.\n\nThe square frame, a tool of the artist, a means of simplifying the complex, of distilling the essence of the scene before me. But on this day, in this moment, I was unable to impose this framework upon the world. The bowl, a simple, everyday object, sat upon a plain, unadorned table, a testament to the banality of existence. And I, a mere observer, stood transfixed, a moth to the flame of the mundane.\n\nPicasso's blue period, Monet's verdant landscapes, the Renaissance masters' kaleidoscope of color – these were the benchmarks against which I measured my own creative endeavors. And yet, as I stood there, frozen in contemplation, I felt a stirring within me, a sense of possibility, of potential. The beginnings of 'Work in Brown', a nascent thing, a germ of an idea, took shape in my mind.\n\nMy hand, a instrument of creation, a extensions of my will, hovered above the surface of the paper, poised to bring forth life. But first, a more humble task, a necessary evil, beckoned. The toilet, a receptacle for the discarded, the unwanted, demanded my attention. A brown package, a loathsome thing, refused to yield to my efforts, stubbornly clinging to the porcelain. I stood, a sentinel, a guardian of the mundane, frowning in frustration.\n\nThe mop, a tool of my trade, hung loosely in my hand, a green tie, a garish splash of color, constricting my neck. I stood, a figure of desolation, a man lost in a sea of indifference. And yet, as I gazed upon the offending bundle, a sense of resolve washed over me. The flush, a soothing balm, a moment of peace, beckoned. And then, with a sense of resignation, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand in a makeshift mitt, a gesture both futile and defiant.\n\nAs I stood, a figure of desolation, a man lost in a sea of indifference, I felt a sense of calm, a sense of acceptance. The world, a vast and overwhelming expanse, receded into the background, and I was left with the simple, the mundane, the brown package, a thing both loathsome and beautiful.",
            "The killing fields of asphalt stretch out before them, a morass of steel and rubber where the young and the arrogant are cut down in their prime.  The statistics are stark, a grim litany of death and destruction that underscores the cruel fate of the teenage driver.  The National Institutes of Health posit that a significant portion of the blame lies with the fragile, untested brain of the adolescent, still reeling from the tumult of growth and development.  Inexperience, too, plays its part, a reckless indifference to the perils of the road that is as much a product of youth as it is of simple ignorance.\n\nThe presence of peers, those fluttering companions of the young, serves only to exacerbate the risk.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center bears witness to the corrosive influence of age and recklessness, a correlation as undeniable as it is sorrowful.  But the attempts to mitigate this carnage, to impose upon the young a semblance of restraint through provisional licenses and limited driving hours, only serve as a feeble palliative, a Band-Aid upon a wound that will not heal.\n\nThe real issue, as any honest examination of the data will reveal, is that the young are, as a group, woefully unprepared to confront the unforgiving realities of the road.  Marvin Zuckerman, a psychologist of unimpeachable credentials, has posited that the age of 18 is, even in this era of permissive indulgence, too young to be entrusted with the keys to a motor vehicle.  His research, borne of a keen understanding of the adolescent psyche, suggests that it is in the later teens and early twenties that the propensity for risk-taking begins to wane, a gradual lessening of the siren's call of reckless abandon.\n\nTo continue to issue licenses to the young, to indulge their passions for speed and thrill, is to invite a catastrophe of unspeakable proportions.  The demography of driving is about to shift, as the Baby Boomer's children come of age and take to the roads in their millions.  The prospect of unchecked carnage is a specter that haunts our collective conscience, a dire warning of what is to come if we fail to act.\n\nLegislation, it would seem, is the only bulwark against this onrushing tide of death and destruction.  Schools, those bastions of learning and wisdom, can continue to provide the necessary instruction in the art of driving, but the keys should remain out of reach of those who have not yet reached the age of reason, who have not yet tempered their impetuousness with a measure of prudence.  A provisional permit, a stepping stone to full licensure, can still be granted, but only after a period of practical instruction, honed to the number of hours deemed necessary by the majority of states.  Uniform, national legislation, rather than a patchwork of state-by-state regulations, is the only way to stem the tide of this national scourge.\n\nThis is no novel proposal, but a blunt acknowledgment of the facts, a recognition that we have been asleep at the wheel, that we have allowed our children to be slaughtered on the highways in a preventable carnage that is both tragic and senseless.",
            "In the musty recesses of the Library of Congress's vast repository of early Edison films, I found myself drawn to the trick films - fifteen in all, dating from 1895 to 1901. These early trifles, with their contrived manipulations, seemed to rely on the cunning art of editing to birth illusions. My study, a meandering path through the labyrinthine world of film, focused on unraveling the poetic essence of these trick films and charting the incremental deviations from the norm that appeared in a few of the later, more daring examples.\n\nIt was a peculiar thing, this turn-of-the-century trick film, bound to the strictures of the proscenium stage. Composed within the foreordained frame, it eschewed the fluidity of camera movement, instead employing long, static shots and medium shots, its narrative tethered to the stilted conventions of the \"one shot, one film\" dictum. And yet, as the century wobbled forward, certain aberrant films defied these strictures, indulging in the novelty of multiple shots.\n\nA most striking feature of the trick films, a trait that linked them in a shared umbilical cord, was their predilection for filming within the confines of a proscenium set. The camera, an unyielding sentinel, remained rooted to its station, unswayed by the ebb and flow of action. This composition, a direct import from the theatre and vaudeville, a realm of smoke and mirrors, dictated the limitations of the trick films. The figures within these films, constrained by the dictates of the stage, moved only in a lateral plane, their paths predetermined by the spatial confines. Witness, for example, the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors entered from the right, their movements confined to the horizontal axis, never once straying from the predetermined path.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style, a visual corollary to the theatre's stubborn adherence to tradition, also led to a dearth of close-up shots. The Edison catalog, a vast repository of trick films, yielded not a single instance of this more intimate, intrusive frame. The theatre, after all, had always been a realm of spectacle, where the entire performance was laid bare for all to see, framed by the unyielding borders of the stage. And so, the actors, rooted to the middle ground, never once ventured forth to breach the camera's gaze.\n\nIn these early trick films, a single conceptual shot was often the equivalent of a cinematic monolith, its brevity and self-containment a testament to the era's nascent understanding of the medium. Most trick films, confined to the realm of the minute or less, focused on the vaudeville-style trifles that had given birth to the genre: magic, disappearing acts, and the art of switching. And yet, a more discerning eye, one attuned to the subtle artifices of the trick film, would detect the seams where the individual shots were joined, the moment when the physical shot gave way to the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Observe, for example, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films, and note the subtle juncture where the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" commences, even as the film remains, to the viewer's eye, a singular, unbroken whole.",
            "In a time long past, a man named John Taylor stood resolute, a champion of the unwavering creed that had taken hold of his heart - the unyielding commitment to the ideals of Republicanism. His life, marked by the sweat and toil of the land, and a fleeting foray into the realm of politics, had tempered him like steel in the fire of conviction. For in the eyes of this ardent proponent, the very profession that had shaped his existence - the unforgiving yet majestic world of agriculture - held the secrets to a far more profound truth: the foundation upon which all his opinions on governance were built.\n\nHis vision for a nation, born of the promise of a tabula rasa, unencumbered by the weight of tradition, was a system of self-governance, wherein the voices of the people, uncorrupted by the taint of power, might yet speak with a voice of reason. And yet, it was not merely a naive utopian dream that drove him, but a deep understanding of the inherent duality that lay at the heart of humanity - the eternal struggle between the good and the evil that lurked within.\n\nFor Taylor, the notion of the \"state of nature\" was a cruel joke, a world where the strong preyed upon the weak, where the cunning and the ruthless held sway over the meek and the timid. But in the realm of civilization, he believed, this must not be the case. It was in this context that he posited the existence of a government, not as a panacea for the ills of humanity, but as a necessary bulwark against the darkness that threatened to consume all.\n\nA government, he argued, must be constructed with the awareness of the inherent duality of human nature, a duality that would forever be in conflict. \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.\" The good principles, he posited, were those that protected private property, fostered the growth of agriculture, and checked the insatiable vice of capitalism. A government founded on such principles, he believed, would stand the test of time, its equanimity unshaken by the vicissitudes of administration, which, inevitably, would be driven by avarice and self-interest.\n\nYet, it was not the absence of self-interest that was the problem, but rather its unchecked excesses, which gave rise to sub-societies that preyed upon the vulnerable. A good government, he argued, was necessary not to eradicate this frailty, but to contain it, to hold it in check, lest it consume the very fabric of society.\n\nTaylor's stance on the Constitution was equally resolute. He advocated for a strict construction, one that bound the Federal government to the strictures of the document, limiting its powers to those explicitly stated, lest it become an instrument of despotism. And yet, he was not naive to the dangers of a literal interpretation, which, without reference to the intent of the framers, could lead to corruption and abuse. For in his estimation, the Declaration of Independence remained the true charter of the United States, a document that spoke to the very essence of the nation's existence as a confederation of sovereign states, rather than a monolithic entity.",
            "The precipitous drop in commuter logs in the third month was a desolate sight, a stark reminder that the fervor of initiative had begun to wane. The onset of winter's chill, the campus shrouded in snow and ice, had doubtless claimed its share of cyclists and pedestrians, leaving the roads empty and still. And then, too, the end of the semester had brought a deluge of tasks and deadlines, a maelstrom that swept all else aside, including the humble commuter log. The holiday season, with its attendant festivities and distractions, had only served to further erode the already flagging participation. Classes, too, had resumed in late January, a reminder that the cycle of academic life had turned once more, leaving the log submissions lagging far behind.\n\nBut it was February, that blank and unforgiving month, that posed the greatest enigma. Had the project's initial momentum, that initial burst of energy and enthusiasm, simply burned itself out, leaving naught but a faint ember of interest? The Carpool Challenge Week, a desperate attempt to rekindle the flames, had paid some dividends, yielding a modest increase in submissions for March. Yet, it remained a faint glimmer of hope in an otherwise desolate landscape. The challenge, it seemed, lay not only in countering the natural ebb and flow of engagement, but in combating the fundamental allure of the automobile, that stalwart companion to our daily lives.\n\nThe prizes, too, had played their part, a meager incentive in a world where the freedom of the open road is a cherished privilege. Gift certificates to local eateries and shops had been our offering, a paltry reward for a sacrifice that few were willing to make. It was a curious thing, indeed, to consider what might have been achieved with more substantial prizes – a bicycle, a hybrid car, an electric vehicle – symbols of a different way of living, one that few were willing to adopt. The prizes, however, remained static throughout, a constant in a world that was ever-changing.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that a more dynamic approach might have been required, one that promised a greater reward for those who chose to brave the elements, to forgo the comfort of their own vehicles. Had we announced a series of escalating prizes, a ladder of rewards that grew higher and higher, perhaps we might have seen a greater surge in participation. But it was not to be. The logs, they remained stubbornly low, a testament to the enduring power of habit and the allure of the automobile.",
            "In the desolate landscape of finance, there existed a creature known as the exchange traded fund, or ETF, a monstrosity born from the union of index, commodity, and asset, its form fluid and shape-shifting like the sands of the desert. It was said to possess the diversification of a sire, the benefits of single stock ownership a siren's call to the unwary investor. The promise of liquidity, of the ability to sell short, to buy on margin, to possess as few as a single share, was a tantalizing one, a whispered secret known only to the initiated. And yet, like the haunted landscape of the American West, there were costs, hidden pitfalls that lurked in the shadows. The expense ratios, a woeful toll, a burden borne by the investor, far lower than those of the average mutual fund, yet a weight to be reckoned with nonetheless.\n\nIn the twilight world of ETFs, the IHF loomed large, a behemoth of diversification, its top ten holdings a promised land of riches. But was it a mirage, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckoned the unwary investor to the precipice of financial ruin? To evaluate this monstrous creature, we narrowed our focus to the top ten holdings, those that comprised 63.58% of its assets, a fraction of the whole, yet a glimpse into the heart of the beast.\n\nThrough the lens of a chart, we beheld the Beta and Return of this subset of holdings, a snapshot of the ETF's very essence. And what did we find? The return, a tantalizing 6.11% greater than the ETF itself, a 16% increase, a siren's call to the investor. And the Beta, a mere .12 lower, a whisper of the safety that lay within. But was this a promise to be trusted? Or a lie, a deceitful whisper in the darkness?\n\nTo answer this, we turned to the standard deviation, that most unforgiving of metrics. We normalized the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, a cold calculation, devoid of passion or sentiment. And what did we find? A portfolio of just these ten holdings, a configuration of the ETF's very essence, offered a higher return, a lower Beta. But was this a statistical certainty, or a mere possibility? The answer, like the desert itself, remained shrouded in mystery.",
            "In the dim recesses of Edgar Allan Poe's oeuvre, \"Dream-Land\" stands as a testament to his command of the darker corners of the human experience. The reappearance of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, as noted by Mabbott, draws our attention to the rippling currents of influence that shaped his work. Virgil's utilization of the term, referencing the fabled island north of Britain, served as a point of departure for Poe's own exploration. Yet, it is in the realm of German literature that we find a more proximate source to which due acknowledgment is owed. Poe's affinity for the works of Goethe is well-documented, a fact that assumes added significance in light of the striking similarities between their respective creations.\n\nThe pertinence of this connection becomes apparent in the words of Karl J. Arndt, who, in his study of Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, discerns a marked homology between the two poets' works, with the conclusion that Poe was, in all likelihood, drawing upon Goethe's inspiration. The celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust, Goethe's magnum opus, published in two parts – the first in 1808, the second in the year of his passing, 1832 – contains, within its somber verse, a concise poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This narrative tells the tale of a monarch whose wife, in her final gesture of love, bestows upon him a goblet, only to succumb to the weight of his grief, which he assuages with an excess of drink and tears.\n\nThe parallels between this narrative and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, as if the latter stands in dark, funereal relation to the former. The King of Thulé's descent into the abyss of despair, his abandonment of the world, and his eventual surrender to the void, serves as a haunting mirror to the speaker's own anguish in \"Dream-Land,\" where the desolate landscape of Thule stretches out like a shroud, a realm of shadows and forgotten joy. The repetition of the term \"Thulé\" in Poe's work, a refrain that bookends \"Dream-Land,\" serves to underscore the connection to Goethe's poem, as if the speaker has stepped into the very realm of the King of Thulé.\n\nGoethe's stature as a literary giant is well-attested, and Poe's regard for him is evident in his admiration for Tennyson. Though the connection to Tennyson serves as a testament to Poe's erudition, it is the prevalence of Goethe's work in the cultural landscape of the time that provides a more immediate explanation for his influence. The multiple reproductions of Goethe's works, following the initial publication of Faust, would have assured Poe's familiarity with the German writer's oeuvre.",
            "The sterile sky hung above the market, a distant hum of indifference to the travails that unfolded beneath. In the realm of California's laws, a plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, seeks to claim punitive damages for the injuries she sustained after slipping on an applesauce spill within the walls of D&D Markets. The question looms: did the store manager, Paul Martin, act with malice, heedless of the probable harm that would befall those who traversed the store's aisles? The issue is not so simple as a yes or no, but rather a tapestry of intent and consequence, woven from the threads of knowledge and neglect.\n\nA judge, arbiter of the law, is unlikely to dismiss Palmer's claim out of hand. To justify punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were committed with a willful disregard for the probable harm that would result, and that the conduct itself was despicable. Palmer's argument is twofold: that Martin should have known the probable harm of neglecting the spill, given the precedent of multiple incidents in the months prior, and that he failed to act despite such knowledge. Though the claim that Martin's actions were despicable may be tenuous, it is not without merit, given the weight of six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, and Martin's inaction in the face of such knowledge.\n\nOn that fateful day, October 13, 2009, at five o'clock in the evening, Rich Wayne, a store employee, informed Martin of the spill in the aisle. Martin's response was a dismissive one, a brush-off to the concerns of his customer, and a prioritization of his own dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, approached Martin with the same news, and met with the same disregard. It was thirty minutes of inaction, a span of time that would prove calamitous for Palmer, who slipped and fell at 5:30 pm, sustaining a serious injury to her back. The store, D&D Markets, had seen five previous slip-and-fall incidents in the year prior, each a missed opportunity to correct a systemic flaw, each a harbinger of the disaster that would soon unfold.\n\nIn California, the law recognizes the right of a plaintiff to seek punitive damages for a breach of obligation, if the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of such intent, a despicable act committed with a willful disregard for the rights or safety of others. The courts have come to characterize such conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, and a willful failure to avoid the consequences of such actions. It is this standard that Palmer will seek to satisfy, in her quest for justice and recompense.",
            "It has been nigh on four winters since I first set foot in a classroom, seated among the dusty tomes and worn desks of CBC.  There, amidst the ceaseless din of debate, one query unsettled the air: was Islam a faith born of hostility?  The question still festers, a suppurating wound that time has failed to heal.  After the calamitous events of 9/11, I watched as the media's stance on Islam underwent a precipitous shift, veering from a stance of abhorrence to one of saccharine tolerance.  A mere two decades ago, a presidential candidate with a Muslim name would have been unimaginable, yet now such a figure sits in the highest office of the land.\n\nThe life of the Prophet Muhammad has long fascinated me, a paradox that defies easy comprehension.  The biography that has come down to us presents a man who, far from the conqueror I had long believed him to be, was instead a martyr, a supplicant who bent his knee to the whims of fate.  One by one, the faithful flocked to his banner, drawn by the radiance of his conviction, not by the sword.  This narrative, I now see, was crafted to convey a man of humility, a holy man who required no proof of his divine calling.\n\nThere are, however, unsettling parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad.  The story of the multiplication of bread and milk, a miracle that fed the forty men in his company, stands out in particular.  This narrative, I suspect, was woven to present Muhammad as a man of quiet strength, a prophet who stood apart from the vainglorious trappings of power.  It is this strategy that troubles me, for it diminishes the singular majesty of Jesus Christ, a man who stood alone, unencumbered by the need for validation.\n\nThe biography, too, is replete with anecdotes that seek to establish the authenticity of the Prophet's teachings.  These tales, however, are often second- or third-hand, recounted by others, far removed from the event itself.  The result is a narrative that strains credulity, a patchwork of hearsay and legend.  I find it difficult to accept such a narrative as proof, for it lacks the weight of direct testimony.\n\nBut it is the portrayal of Muhammad as a paragon of virtue that most offend me.  This holy man, revered by millions, is often depicted as a figure of unassailable wisdom, of compassion and gentleness.  Yet the annals of history suggest otherwise, a more complex, more troubled figure, whose ascent to power was marked by bloodshed and strife.  I am left to wonder if the faithful are aware of the true nature of their Prophet, or if they remain blind to the darkness that shrouds his legacy.",
            "In the aftermath of Jesus' mortal coil, the teachings he left behind were eroded by the relentless tide of Christian thought.  Like a river's course, which winds its way through the landscape, ever-changing, ever-shifting, so too did the Christian faith.  The waters of tradition, the sediment of doctrine, and the currents of dogma all conspired to carry the faith further and further from its source.  Yet, in this vast, dark expanse of time, a faint glimmer of awareness begins to stir.  A growing number of souls, weary of the stifling weight of tradition, yearn to peel back the layers of dogma, to strip away the accretions that have accumulated like barnacles on a hull, and to rediscover the living, breathing Jesus at the heart of it all.  This will not be a swift or easy process.  It will be a gradual, reluctant, and painful one, like the unmooring of a ship from its anchors.  But it will happen.  History is replete with such reversals - the Roman Empire, once a bastion of paganism, became a Christian empire; our own nation, once a bastion of slavery, became a beacon of freedom.  And so too will the Christian faith undergo a great reversal, a great unwinding of the coils of time, a great unmaking of doctrine and dogma.  It will be a process of stripping away, of peeling back the layers, of returning to the raw, unvarnished Jesus, the Jesus who spoke in parables and paradoxes, who defied literal interpretation and beckoned us to the depths of the human heart.  To read his words as metaphor, not as dogma, is to join this great reversal, to embark on the journey back to the source, to the wellspring of faith itself.  And what did the world look like before the tides of Christian thought swept across it?  It was a world of Judaism, a world of the Hebrew scriptures, a world of monotheism and divine revelation.  A world of division and splintering, where the Jewish people were rent asunder by the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Zealots, each with their own interpretation of the divine.  But even in that fractured world, there was a common thread, a common purpose, a common humanity that underlay it all.  And so too will it be in the future, when the great reversal has taken place, and the Christian faith has returned to its source, when the waters have stilled and the sediment has settled.  The world will be a simpler, more unified place, where the spirit of Jesus shines forth, unencumbered by the weight of tradition, unvarnished by the distortions of time.",
            "The scabrous underbelly of human nature is laid bare in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, a bleak testament to the innate greed and self-aggrandizement that festers within the hearts of men. It is an abyss of unyielding avarice, where the pursuit of wealth and power supplants all else, leaving in its wake a trail of devastation and despair. The factory owners and managers, monarchs of the great industrial behemoths, reign with an iron fist, crushing all who dare stand in their way. They care not for the toll their relentless pursuit takes on the land, nor for the lives they shatter with each passing day.\n\nAs Sinclair's words paint a picture of the ravaged landscape, the smoke-belching chimneys pierce the sky like skeletal fingers, a grim reminder of the devastation wrought by human greed. The rivers of smoke that stream away to the horizon are a stark testament to the disregard with which the owners view the world around them, a world they seek to exploit for their own selfish ends. The pens that house the thousands of animals, the putrid runoff of their waste, are but a mere afterthought, a trifling concern in their unyielding quest for profit.\n\nNor do they spare a thought for the wretched souls who toil in their factories, their sweat and blood the lifeblood of the industry. \"A seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" is what Sinclair calls this place, a pit of unrelenting cruelty, where the dollar is the only currency that holds value. The workers are cogs in a machine, dispensable and replaceable, their humanity stripped away by the cold calculus of commerce. They toil in darkness, their hours long and grueling, their lives reduced to a mere existence. And when they are cast aside, discarded like so much refuse, they are left to pick up the shards of their shattered lives, with no solace, no aid, and no respite.\n\nIn this era, the workers were but helpless pawns, preyed upon by the unscrupulous and the ruthless. The unions, formed with the intention of protecting their interests, often proved to be wolves in sheep's clothing, feeding on the very flesh they sought to defend. And so the workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and despair, were left to suffer, their lives a mere abstraction, a mere commodity to be bought and sold. \"A population,\" Sinclair writes, \"low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\" The parallels are stark, the echoes of a dark and troubled past, a cautionary tale of the horrors that lie in wait when humanity is reduced to its basest impulses.",
            "The canvas of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is threaded with a tapestry of meanings, woven from the very fabric of language itself. He employs a multitude of techniques to coax a particular hue from his readers, to conjure an aura that clings to the page like the mist that veils the valley of ashes. Fitzgerald's palette is broad, his brushstrokes bold, as he pairs unlikely companions - an adjective and a noun - to conjure an essence that clings to the reader like the sweat on a summer's day. The colors of his world are imbued with significance, each one a key that unlocks a door to a realm of meaning.\n\nWhite and gray, those twin siblings of the mundane, are Fitzgerald's instruments of choice. He coaxes from them a meaning that is at once both familiar and distant, like the whispered secrets of a summer breeze. In the beginning of the novel, the whiteness is that of the newlyweds, Daisy and Jordan, their faces alabaster, their skin powdered and pale as the driven snow. And Tom, the old-money aristocrat, wears his white shirt like a badge of honor, a symbol of the class that he so desperately seeks to preserve. Even Nick, the outsider, is drawn into this world of white, his flannels crisp and clean as the driven snow.\n\nBut as the novel unfolds, Fitzgerald's palette darkens, the white giving way to a grayer, more muted hue. The world of the Valley of Ashes is a place of desolation, a wasteland of gray cars and gray land, where the once-white dreams of the American Dream have withered and died. And Daisy, that elusive creature, is reduced to a mere cipher, a uniform of white, a dress that conceals the emptiness within. Her whiteness is now a reminder of the uniformity that lies at the heart of the American experience, a world where the individual is lost in the crowd, a faceless, nameless, forgotten soul.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is a masterclass in the art of suggestion, a reminder that meaning is not always what it seems. The colors of his world are a reflection of the human condition, a world where the lines between reality and illusion are blurred, where the past and present coexist in a world of gray. And it is in this world of gray, this world of uniformity, that we find the true meaning of The Great Gatsby, a novel that is at once both a critique of the American Dream and a paean to its enduring power.",
            "The arid landscape of San Diego County lay barren and unforgiving, yet it was here that the land yielded its secrets to the gentle touch of human toil. A mild and sun-scorched climate coaxed forth a bounty of crops, each one a testament to the unfettered will of nature: the plump, crimson tomatoes, the verdant citrus, the leafy greens that sprouted like verdant fingers, the squash and broccoli that burst forth in shimmering profusion. And the trees, those stalwart sentinels of the land, stood watch over the berries, peaches, and lemons, their fruit a sweet and generous gift. The air was heavy with the scent of honey, a golden nectar that seemed to seep from the earth itself, and the peppers, those fiery guardians of the land, stood watch over all.\n\nThe market for organic produce was a siren's call, beckoning those who would listen to the rhythms of the land. The waiting lists for community-supported agriculture programs were long and winding, a testament to the allure of a life untainted by the harsh chemicals that had desecrated so much of the world. And the eggs and milk, those simple, wholesome staples, were sought after by those who craved the purity of the land.\n\nBut the lure of the land was not without its costs. The organic farmer labored under a harder yoke, his sweat and toil a necessary price for the bounty he sought to reap. The pests and weeds that infested the land demanded constant vigilance, their presence a reminder of the delicate balance that governed this world. And the soil, that rich and fertile cradle of life, required a gentle hand, a careful touch that would coax forth its secrets without despoiling its depths.\n\nYet, it was in this desolate yet fecund landscape that the landowner found a chance to redeem the land, to restore it to its former glory. The parcel of land, a 160-acre expanse of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland, lay adjacent to the town of Potrero, a town that had grown up around the Cleveland National Forest. And it was here, in this fragile ecosystem, that the landowner might find a way to balance the books, to coax forth a profit from the land without desecrating its beauty.\n\nThe land had a history, a tale of untold centuries, of Native Americans who had walked these hills, their footsteps silent on the wind. And then, the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers had come, their presence a scar on the land, a reminder of the human touch that had shaped this world. The original homestead patent had brought forth a new era, one of grazing and wood production, a cycle that had repeated itself for generations.\n\nIn my research, I had stumbled upon a real estate listing, a piece of property that seemed to whisper its secrets to me, a small farmer seeking to eke out a living in this unforgiving yet fecund land. I had scoured the government programs, searching for a way to mitigate the costs, to preserve the wildlife-friendly operations that would allow the land to flourish. And it was in this quest that I had found an organic farm in the same area, a model of what might be achieved, a testament to the power of the human spirit in this arid yet verdant landscape.",
            "Culture is a labyrinth, its contours ever-shifting, its outlines blurred by the shadows of what it is not. It is a tapestry woven from threads of what it signifies, of what it stands for, and what it has become. The notion of a singular, homogeneous culture is a myth, a mirage that vanishes upon closer inspection. The assertions that \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are little more than a whispered rumor, a faint echo of a truth that has been distorted by the passage of time. Yet, it is precisely these generalizations that lead us astray, that distract us from the subtle nuances that govern a culture's behavior in the crucible of negotiation.\n\nTo navigate the treacherous waters of cultural understanding, one must first learn to listen to the whispers of history, to the prejudices that have shaped the contours of a culture's soul. This is not a matter of judging or condoning, but of accepting the culture for what it is, of acknowledging its boundaries, its limitations. For the negotiator, this is a matter of paramount importance, especially when the playing field is uneven, when the stakes are high and the position is weak. In such circumstances, a deep respect for the traditions and beliefs of the opposing culture can be a lifeline, a thread that weaves its way through the darkness, guiding us forward, one tentative step at a time.\n\nBut culture is not a monolith, a single entity that can be reduced to a national or international dichotomy. It is a hydra, a many-headed beast that adapts, evolves, and mutates in response to its environment. Within the confines of a nation, a corporation can cultivate its own culture, a unique and intricate web of values, customs, and practices that set it apart from its peers. This corporate culture can be seen in the dress codes that govern the workplace, in the communication styles that flow like a river through its halls, in the hiring practices that seek out the best and brightest. Some companies are temples of industry, where long hours are a badge of honor, while others are sanctuaries of relaxation, where the boundaries between work and play are blurred. And within these companies, there are subcultures, hidden worlds that pulsate with their own rhythms, their own values.\n\nBut it is not just the external trappings of culture that are important; it is the values that lie at its core. These are the unseen forces that shape behavior, that govern the ways in which individuals interact with one another. If a culture values saving face above all else, a negotiator will be reluctant to engage in public displays of conflict, lest they bring shame upon themselves and their organization. If a culture values the pursuit of a hard-driven bargain above all else, a negotiator will be willing to push the limits of what is acceptable, to test the mettle of their opponent, to see who will blink first. And it is precisely this understanding of values that is essential to successful negotiation, for it is the unseen currents that flow beneath the surface of culture that can either make or break an agreement.\n\nTo navigate these currents, a negotiator must be willing to listen, to observe, and to learn. They must seek to understand their opponent on a personal level, to grasp the subtleties of their motivations, their fears, and their desires. For it is not the surface-level understanding of culture that will serve them well, but the deep understanding that comes from empathy, from a willingness to see the world through the eyes of another. This is the key to effective negotiation, the thread that weaves its way through the labyrinth of culture, leading us forward, one step at a time.",
            "The darkness whispers in the hearts of men, a voice that dares to declare the unutterable: \"There is no God.\" This is the cry that echoes through the ages, a refrain taken from the ancient texts of the Christian Bible, specifically the Psalm of the 14th verse. It is a notion that finds its echo in the work of Thomas Aquinas, a philosopher who sought to anchor the existence of the divine in the bedrock of reason. And yet, we find ourselves standing at the crossroads, tasked with comparing the arguments of two men, both champions of the same creed, to determine which one shines brighter in the light of truth.\n\nTo navigate this labyrinth, we must first concede the impossible – that both Anselm and Aquinas speak truth, their voices harmonizing in a hymn of praise to the same God. To posit a deity of ambiguous form would be to render their arguments sterile, mere exercise in futility. And so, we shall begin with the assumption that their God is the God of the Bible, a being of defined presence and purpose.\n\nAs we delve into the heart of Anselm's argument, we find a path that winds through the recesses of the human soul. He posits that God's existence is not a externality, something to be discovered in the world without, but rather an internality, a truth that resides within the very fabric of our being. The mind, that great instrument of comprehension, is the key to unlocking the puzzle of the divine. We are not required to venture forth into the wilderness of empirical evidence to find proof of God's existence; rather, the evidence lies within, a flame that flickers in the darkness, awaiting recognition. This is the essence of faith – a conviction that transcends the mundane, a leap of trust into the unknown.\n\nBut Aquinas journeys a different path, one that seeks to anchor the existence of God in the certainties of reason. His is an endeavor to prove the divine through the crucible of logic, to distill the essence of God from the alembic of empirical evidence. The proof, in his view, lies not in the whispers of the heart, but in the cold, unforgiving light of reason. He marshals five mighty arguments to his cause: the proof of change, the necessity of causation, the contingency of being, the gradations of excellence, and the harmony of the universe. In each, he demonstrates that the existence of God is not a mystery, but a necessity, a logical consequence of the very fabric of reality.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves standing at the crossroads, the arguments of these two great thinkers laid before us like a puzzle, each piece carefully crafted, each one a testament to the power of the human mind. Which one shall we choose? Shall we follow Anselm's path, a journey through the labyrinth of the soul, or shall we follow Aquinas, a path of reason and empirical evidence? The choice, like the existence of God, remains a mystery, waiting to be revealed in the depths of our own hearts.",
            "In a time long past, a prince would arise, a man who would come to be known as the Buddha. His footsteps would lead him down a path of renunciation, a path that would ultimately deliver him into the depths of enlightenment. And it was from this enlightenment that the seeds of Buddhism would be sown, a seed that would germinate into a vast and labyrinthine tree, its branches stretching forth across the centuries like skeletal fingers. It is a tree that now stands as the most orthodox of its kind, known as Theravada Buddhism. Twenty five hundred years have transpired since the Buddha's time, and the world has changed. Yet the echoes of that distant era still linger, like the whispers of a forgotten wind. In the land of Sri Lanka, a nation born of Theravada, the water-cutting ceremony takes place each year. Monks and laymen alike converge upon this spectacle, a ritual that holds significance, though one that the Buddha himself never spoke of. The fissures that have developed between the church and the world are manifold, a chasm that yawns wide between the superficial trappings of tradition and the soteriological core of the faith.\n\nThroughout the annals of time, the Theravada Buddhist community has been subject to the vicissitudes of internal and external forces. The former, a force born of the community itself, is a force both benign and malignant. The latter, an external force, is any influence that comes from without. It is this duality that will be a recurring theme throughout this discussion.\n\nAs we delve into the heart of Theravada, we find ourselves confronted with a rich tapestry of doctrine. The triple gem, the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, serves as the foundation upon which the entire edifice of the faith is built. The Dhamma, a vast and sprawling entity, comprises the Tripitaka, that most ancient and revered of texts. The Tripitaka is divided into three baskets, each one a repository of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, those sacred utterances of the Buddha himself. The Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, a code of conduct that guides the lives of both monk and layman. And the Abhidhamma Pitaka, that most obscure and esoteric of texts, contains the metaphysical musings of the faith. Here, the concepts of Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca hold sway. Anatta, the notion that the self is but a fleeting illusion; Dukkha, the inherent suffering that pervades all existence; and Anicca, the impermanence that governs all things. It is only through the recognition of these truths that one may transcend the cycle of death and rebirth, that great wheel of suffering known as Sansara. And with Sansara's demise, the three great pitfalls that beset humanity – lobha, dosa, and moha – will also be vanquished. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth a code of conduct for the layman, five simple yet profound precepts that guide his actions. For the monk, the rules are many and complex, a labyrinthine path that must be navigated with precision. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths, a quartet of unyielding principles that serve as the bedrock of the faith. First, the truth of Dukkha, the recognition that life is but a river of suffering. Second, the truth that attachment is the source of suffering. Third, the truth that suffering may be overcome.",
            "In the arid expanse of the North American continent, two nations lay bound by a tenuous thread of animosity that stretched across nearly six decades, from the parched earth of 1836 to the cusp of the twentieth century's first great conflagration in 1893. This was the United States and Mexico, two lands beset by a rivalry that ebbed and flowed like the Rio Grande, its source and terminus forever tied to the unyielding tides of history. The calamitous war of 1846-1848 stood as a watershed moment, a high-water mark that saw the United States lay claim to the spoils of Texas and the Southwest, leaving in its wake a scar that would never fully heal.\n\nAs the years marched on, the enmity between the two nations only deepened, fueled by the primal fires of conflicting interests and the unyielding convictions of a people. It was a struggle born of the crucible of history, forged in the fire of clashing cultures and the unyielding passions of a bygone era. The spectral presence of the past loomed large, a testament to the indelible mark left by the Spanish and English empires that had once ruled over these twin nations. The distrust that had been sown in those distant days would prove a fertile ground for the rivalries that would follow, a legacy that would shape the destiny of these two lands for generations to come.\n\nThe United States and Mexico were not alone in their struggle. Across the globe, nations born of shared borders and conflicting interests had long been locked in a dance of rivalry, their steps choreographed by the ancient rhythms of history. Yet, the particular flavor of this enmity was unique, a complex brew of ideological and material differences that would prove a potent elixir for the animosity that simmered between these two nations. As David M. Pletcher so astutely observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" – a truth that would be borne out by the tortuous path of relations between the United States and its southern neighbor.\n\nAt its core, the rivalry between the two nations was a struggle born of faith, a clash of incompatible visions for the future that would prove as intractable as the mountains that separated them. Sally Frahm noted that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Americans had been driven by a fervent opposition to Catholicism and monarchy, a dichotomy that would find its mirror image in the Mexican people's own unyielding devotion to the Catholic faith. This fundamental difference would prove a chasm that would be bridged only by the patient efforts of those willing to navigate the treacherous waters of diplomacy.\n\nOver the course of its 57-year tenure, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico would leave in its wake a trail of disputes that would number seventeen, a litany of border raids, territorial squabbles, and frontier conflicts that would leave the very fabric of their relationship frayed and worn. The specter of bandits and outlaws, those shadowy figures that had long haunted the borders of both nations, would prove a constant thorn in the side of those seeking to establish a lasting peace. It was only when the United States and Mexico came to recognize the futility of their endless struggle that the tide of history began to turn, as Mexico's dependence on the United States grew and American ambitions shifted from the pursuit of territorial expansion to the quiet calculus of economic intervention.",
            "Fifteen years ago, the darkness crept in, an uninvited guest that stole the breath from my lungs and left me crippled, a stranger in my own skin. I was a nurse then, a guardian of the sick and the frail, a keeper of secrets and a witness to the fragility of life. The fire that once drove me, a flame of purpose and ambition, had been reduced to a smoldering ember, a reminder of what could never be again.\n\nThe words of a well-meaning stranger lingered in my mind, a mantra repeated like a dirge: \"You'll always find work, for there will always be those who fall ill.\" And so I chose nursing, a profession born of necessity, a way to silence the gnawing doubts that haunted me since childhood. But the dreams I had, the scientist, the journalist, they were reduced to ashes, the embers of a fire that had been extinguished.\n\nFifteen years have passed, and I am still a shadow of my former self, a specter haunting the fringes of society, dependent on the charity of others for survival. The days blend together, a never-ending expanse of tedium and despair, a constant reminder that I am but a fragile, temporal thing. And yet, in the midst of this desolate landscape, there is one truth that I hold onto, a beacon of hope in a world that seems determined to extinguish it: I am not alone.\n\nIt is a lesson that has been driven home by the kindness of family and friends, the unwavering support of those who refused to abandon me in my darkest hour. And I know that I am not exceptional in this, for it is in the face of disaster that we discover our true strength, our capacity for compassion and resilience.\n\nWe are fond of speaking of rugged individualism, of the pioneers who braved the unknown, who forged a new path in the wilderness. But let us not forget that it was not the lone wolf that survived, but the communities that banded together, that shared what little they had, that offered a helping hand in the face of the unknown. We would do well to remember this, to recognize that it is not in our individual strength that we find true security, but in the bonds that tie us together.\n\nI have prepared for the worst, stocked my pantry with canned goods, my cupboard with candles and matches, my mind with the knowledge of how to survive in a world gone mad. But I have also learned that true preparedness lies not in the things we possess, but in the relationships we cultivate, the connections we make with those around us. For it is in the face of disaster that we discover our true character, our capacity for compassion, for kindness, for forgiveness.\n\nGet to know your neighbors, for it is in their eyes that you will find a glimmer of hope, a reflection of the humanity that binds us all together. Do not wait until the darkness descends, until the storm rages, to reach out, to seek help, to offer aid. For it is in the quiet moments, in the stillness of the day, that we find the strength to face the unknown, to stand together against the tempests that will inevitably come.",
            "The labyrinthine paths of evolution, a mystery that has confounded the most erudite of scholars since the dawn of time. D'Arcy Thompson, a man of vision and sage insight, spoke these words in 1917: \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" And so it remains, a truth we find ourselves entwined in, even as we strive to unravel the tangled threads of change within the mollusk's skeletogenesis.\n\nOur study, a foray into the uncharted territories of Prunum, seeks to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We have employed mathematical modeling, a tool of precision and elegance, to chart the ontogenetic and phylogenetic transformations of this enigmatic creature. X-radiographic images of Prunum species have been scrutinized, yielding quantitative parameters that have been fed into the software program CerioShell, a digital realm where hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies converge.\n\nWithin this virtual expanse, we have crafted a topology of possible shell forms, a map of the boundaries that contain the morphological potential of Prunum. These cartographies are being woven together with experimental and descriptive studies, an intricate tapestry that seeks to illuminate the macroevolutionary events that have shaped this clade.\n\nA shell, that most wondrous and intricate of structures, is a spiral of space and time, a tube that unwinds through 360 degrees of existence. The whorls, those concentric coils, spiral around an axis, a columella that runs through the central column of the shell like a thread through a needle. The speed of these whorls' growth can fluctuate, creating a suture, a line that separates each coil like the crease on a worn leather glove. The body whorl, the final coil, stands as the largest, a sentinel that guards the vulnerable aperture.\n\nThe spire, a series of whorls that precede the body whorl, rises like a shard of light from the darkness. The apex, the tip of this spire, pierces the sky, while the base, the opposite extremity, sinks into the earth. And from this opening, the mollusk emerges, a creature of mystery and beauty.\n\nThe shell, a testament to the ingenuity of its creator, can be viewed from four quadrants: the apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The apertural view, a vista that frames the aperture, is the most common, a perspective that reveals the shell in all its glory.\n\nTo count the whorls, one must gaze upon the shell from the apical view, where the first suture begins its journey. A line, a divider, separates the shell into two parts, and the whorls are counted, estimated to a quarter of a turn. The aperture, that vulnerable opening, can be traced through time and space, its path a trajectory of growth and change.\n\nThis trajectory, a mathematical formulation, can be represented graphically, a dance of lines and curves that capture the essence of the mollusk's skeletogenesis. And once this formulation is crafted, the parameters can be varied, and the mollusk's growth can be modified, a world of possibilities unfolding like a lotus flower in the sun.",
            "The shadows of mortality hung over the cradles of Indonesia, a specter that refused to be vanquished. For a decade, the numbers had held steady, a grim testament to the unyielding grip of disease and despair. The promise of the Millennium Development Goals, like beacons in the darkness, beckoned to this forsaken land, but the progress was slow, a mere trickle in the face of unyielding need. The targets loomed ahead, a distant mirage on the horizon, as the country struggled to find its footing in the treacherous terrain of child and maternal health.\n\nIn the midst of this desolate landscape, a glimmer of hope flickered to life. The attendance of skilled health workers at births had increased, a modest gain of 72% in a land where tradition and superstition still held sway. Yet, this meager triumph was tainted by the knowledge that many of these birth attendants were but midwives, unversed in the dark arts of medicine, powerless against the crushing forces of hemorrhage that cut short the lives of so many mothers.\n\nThe numbers told a tale of unfulfilled promise. Diarrheal cases in children under five had declined, yet the treatment of these afflictions by health professionals had begun to stagnate, a testament to the feeble state of Indonesia's healthcare infrastructure. The shadows of postnatal care hung over the land, a void that yawned wide, unlit and unforgiving.\n\nThe cesarean section rate, a statistic that hung like a guillotine over the lives of countless women, stood at a paltry 4%, a number that spoke volumes about the limited access to healthcare in this forsaken land. And yet, it was not a uniform rate, a grim reminder of the yawning chasm between the haves and the have-nots. In the cities, the rate stood at 7%, a gaudy display of privilege, while in the rural areas, it teetered at a mere 2%, a stark testament to the cruel indifference of fate.\n\nThe vertical equity gap yawned wide, a chasm that separated the poor from the rich, a gulf that seemed insurmountable. The numbers spoke of a 27% disparity in service utilization, a cruel reminder that access to healthcare was a privilege reserved for the few, a luxury that the many could only dream of. The out-of-pocket costs, a heavy burden that weighed upon the shoulders of the poor, a weight that threatened to crush them beneath its unyielding pressure.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the land in a dark and foreboding shadow, the question hung in the air, a question that seemed to taunt and tease. How to bridge the chasm, to close the yawning void that gaped between the haves and the have-nots? Should Indonesia turn to the siren song of program-specific approaches, a panacea that promised quick fixes and easy answers, or should it instead strengthen the frail and faltering health system, a system that seemed to be on the brink of collapse?\n\nThe allure of vertical approaches, with their targeted objectives and manageable outcomes, was strong, a seductive siren's call that beckoned to the weary and the worn. Yet, the drawbacks were clear, a warning sign that screamed of the dangers of a myopic focus. The diversion of resources, the siphoning off of funds and personnel, the duplication of services, and the paperwork, a tangled web of bureaucracy that threatened to strangle the very life from the system.\n\nIn the end, it was a choice between a quick fix and a long-term solution, between a band-aid and a cure. The fate of Indonesia's children and mothers hung in the balance, a fragile thread that seemed to tremble in the wind, a thread that threatened to snap at any moment, plunging the land into an abyss of despair.",
            "In the labyrinthine world of Victorian fiction, a peculiarity exists where two novels dare to diverge from the conventions of their time. Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, two works often regarded as outliers, weave a tapestry of mystery and the unknown. These aberrations from the norm imbue their characters with an aura of enigma, allowing the reader to glimpse the hidden recesses of their psyche, where motives and emotions reside.\n\nAs the darkness closed in around Oliver Twist, a maelstrom of confusion swept through his mind. The echoes of Sikes and Crackit's contentious voices still lingered, their words seared into his memory like a branding iron. And then, without warning, the sound of gunfire shattered the air, a cacophony of chaos that lifted him up and bore him away. In the tumult, a searing pain gnawed at his consciousness, an undefined ache that refused to subside.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dreamlike sequences serve as a window into the protagonist's tortured soul. The shooting that nearly claimed his life is revisited in a vivid, nightmarish recollection, where the lines between reality and fantasy blur. As he searches for respite, Oliver's senses are numbed, his body a vessel for the unseen forces that propelled him through the streets. The pain, once a shock, had become a constant companion, its grip tightening with every passing moment. In this state of abject despair, the question lingers: whose hand had guided Oliver's fate, for it was certainly not his own? The shooting serves as a potent reminder of his powerlessness, a growing sense of defeat that had been sown by the relentless drumbeat of Fagin's cruelty.\n\nThe day passed, a fleeting whisper of existence, a moment's pause between the darkness that preceded and the darkness that followed. Night descended, a shroud that wrapped around the world, its silence oppressive, its brevity a cruel mockery. The hours ticked by, each one a slow march towards the abyss, as the shadows deepened and the silence grew.",
            "In the brutal light of a bygone afternoon, I recall a boy named Adrian, his small form huddled over a primer, his eyes cast down upon the page as if searching for some hidden truth. I had been tasked with his tutelage, guiding him through the labyrinthine passages of English, a language that for him was as foreign as the stars that shone in the desert night. His struggles were peculiar, a jarring discord that echoed through the halls of the after-school program. Some letters danced upon his tongue with ease, while others recoiled in terror, their pronunciation a cacophony that rent the air. His mother, a woman of unyielding resolve, walked in upon me, her eyes flashing with a language I could not understand, a tongue that was alien to my ears. Our halting conversation was a dance of gestures and fumbling words, a fragile thread that bound us together.\n\nAnd then, like a revelation from the heavens, it struck me: Adrian's reading troubles lay not in comprehension, but in the very alphabet itself. The English language, a behemoth that towered over him like a colossus, seemed to mock his every attempt. I fear that my feeble efforts did little to aid him, but I hope that he has since found solace in the written word.\n\nI speak of this tale to highlight the insidious presence of the language barrier, a specter that haunts the halls of learning, particularly in the sun-kissed lands of California. It is a problem that masquerades as a straightforward issue, but in reality, it is a Gordian knot that defies easy solution. Even the most fluent of speakers can find themselves lost in the labyrinth of the written word. I propose that we abandon the simplistic thinking that has thus far dominated our approach. Tutoring, immersion, ESL classes, and bilingual programs are all piecemeal solutions, a patchwork quilt that fails to address the underlying issue.\n\nThe dual language system, a notion that has been shunned by some as a frivolous indulgence, holds the key to unlocking the doors of understanding. Research has shown that children who participate in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers, their academic prowess a testament to the power of language. The fear that surrounds this idea – that it is a waste of resources, a luxury that only a select few can afford – is nothing but a myth. If we were to adopt this approach as the norm, rather than the exception, the benefits would be felt by all. But how do we accomplish this? Do we require our teachers to be bilingual, a demand that is both unreasonable and unrealistic? No, I propose that we provide them with the tools they need, bilingual assistants, tutors, and aids who can bridge the gap between languages.",
            "In the earliest hours of our existence, a whispered truth has been imparted upon us: that there exists a presence beyond our mortal grasp, a thing that defies comprehension. The devout seek answers in hushed tones within the confines of temple or pulpit, while others search within the labyrinthine corridors of their own minds. Many cling to the creeds bequeathed to them by their forebears, yet others reject them outright, convinced that the universe is a singular, self-contained entity. And so we wander, each of us forging our own path in the pursuit of spiritual understanding, driven by an unquenchable thirst for meaning in a world shrouded in darkness.\n\nAs I recall, my father's gaze would often drift out into the void, his eyes a window to the depths of his soul. It was a look that spoke of remembrance and longing, a look that seemed to both seek and eschew connection. The rain pounded against the tin roof above us, a relentless drumbeat that underscored the weight of our silence. We sat on the creaking porch, the air thick with the acrid smoke of our cigarettes, the gutters spilling forth a deluge that drowned the parched earth. His frame had grown gaunt, his skin sallow, his hair thinned to a sparse veil. He stared out into the rain, avoiding my gaze, and I felt a hollow sense of desolation, a feeling that our words would only serve to make the ache more palpable. So I reached out, wrapped my arms around him, and drew closer, our eyes fixed on the rain-soaked world beyond.\n\nIt was December when he finally succumbed, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, buying time that neither he nor I could fully grasp. And as I lay in the darkness, I found myself questioning the benevolence of a deity who could ordain such a fate. The shadows closed in around me, and I whispered no prayers, for if a god existed, I believed it had long since turned a deaf ear to my pleas. \n\nI had not wished to bear witness to his passing, to watch as the spark that animated him flickered out. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he had become. I knew him better than they did, better than his kin, and I knew that he would not have wanted me to be a spectator to his final moments. I retreated into myself, curled into a ball, and waited for the news that would shatter the fragile silence. But even that comfort was denied me, for no one came to break the stillness.\n\nThe darkness lingered, a heavy blanket that suffocated me, as I waited.",
            "In the crepuscular twilight of literary history, the Gothic novel emerges, a paradoxical union of the antique and the modern. This oxymoronic marriage, as Ian Watt so astutely observed, gives rise to a genre both bereft and beguiling. The Gothic mode has been reviled, extolled, and reviled once more, accused of being a shallow masquerade, yet lauded for its capacity to evoke the \"terrible sublime.\" The foundational text, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, serves as a crucible, fusing the residues of medieval romances and the nascent stirrings of the modern novel. Walpole's Gothic narrative, a deliberate amalgam of \"old\" theatrical conceits and \"new\" narrative innovations, yields a singular beast, a \"Gothic Story\" that defies categorization.\n\nIn the fluid, protean realm of the Gothic, the boundaries between past and present, high and low, blur and dissolve. The genre's roots lie in the decaying, gothicized architecture of medieval theatre, its traditions and tropes endlessly revisited and reinterpreted. The word \"gothic,\" a term once freighted with associations of archaism and unsophistication, had long been employed to describe various peoples, styles, and epochs. Yet, it was precisely this syncretic quality, this willingness to blend and blur, that allowed the Gothic to endure, to become both anachronistic and perennially relevant to readers situated in disparate temporalities.\n\nChivalry, that vaunted ideal of the medieval knight, holds a significant place within the Gothic canon. Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a text born of turmoil and disillusionment, idealizes and romanticizes the chivalric code, that mirage of honor, bravery, and competence. Through its deployment of chivalric motifs and manners, the Gothic past is reimagined as a lost Eden, a golden age of moral certainties and unblemished virtue. This nostalgic impulse, a yearning for a bygone era, serves as a counterpoint to the perceived decay and corruption of the present. In Walpole's writing, the character of Frederic embodies this chivalric ideal, his description replete with traditional epicurean flourishes: a prince, a sufferer, a wanderer, and a martyr, his very existence a testament to the allure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight.\" The excesses of his character, a deliberate exaggeration of the chivalric type, introduce the Gothic trope of the excessive, a note that would resound throughout the genre.",
            "In the hardscrabble expanse of commerce, a labyrinthine process unfolds, a serpentine path of goods from the primal sources of raw materials to the anxious hands of the customer. This is the supply chain, a ceaseless dance of production, supply, and distribution, a grand ballet of movement and purpose. The term supply chain management, a concept forged in the crucible of modern industry, owes its existence to the keen insight of Keith Oliver, a sage counselor to the captains of commerce. In 1982, Oliver illuminated the contours of this intricate process, a harmonious marriage of planning, implementation, and control, all aimed at satisfying the capricious whims of the customer in a world where time is a luxury.\n\nSix elemental pillars support this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. The masters of the corporate realm utilize these foundations to construct a bulwark of customer satisfaction, a fortress of service that rises above the din of competition. But at the heart of this grand endeavor lies production, the inaugural step in the supply chain's gestation. Here, the when, why, where, and how of creation are coaxed into being, a delicate waltz of planning and execution. The managers' first task is to divine the desires of the customer, to listen to the whispers of the market, that capricious mistress who holds the keys to the kingdom of demand.\n\nThe market, a vast and unforgiving expanse, holds the secrets of the customer's heart, and it is here that the managers must seek guidance. Once the market's intentions are deciphered, the managers can proceed to shape the contours of production, deciding what products shall be created, in what quantities, and where they shall be forged. The location of production, a critical juncture in the supply chain's trajectory, must balance the competing demands of volume and quality, a tightrope walk of logistics and strategy. And so, the managers toil, their every decision a calculated gamble in the high-stakes game of commerce.\n\nThe scheduling of workloads, the maintenance of equipment, and the precise calibration of production all conspire to create a symphony of efficiency, a finely tuned machine that can withstand the vicissitudes of the market. For in the world of supply chain management, every detail is a vital thread in the intricate tapestry of success. A misstep, a miscalculation, can have far-reaching consequences, a ripple effect that can cost a company dearly in the long run.\n\nConsider, if you will, the retail behemoths of Wal-Mart and Target, those titans of the corporate world, whose every move is a calculated exercise in precision. Their systems, a labyrinthine network of processes and protocols, a finely honed instrument of commerce, allow them to navigate the treacherous waters of supply chain management with ease. The employee's uniform, a symbol of corporate identity, is but one small part of this grand design, a testament to the power of planning and anticipation.\n\nSupply, the second pillar of the supply chain, is a realm of strategic decision-making, a high-stakes game of chess where the pawns are facilities and partnerships. A company's core capabilities, its very identity, are forged in the crucible of supply, where the manager must decide which divisions of production are best suited to the task at hand. And when the decision is made to outsource, to partner with other companies, the aim is clear: to create velocity, to achieve that elusive balance of quality, flexibility, and cost. For in the world of supply chain management, velocity is the holy grail, the unattainable goal that drives the company forward, ever onward, into the unknown.",
            "A weathered cardboard sign creaked in the wind, its message scrawled in hasty, black letters: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". Ellen Page, a fragile figure, stood alone on a cracked sidewalk, her eyes cast downward as if in supplication. The words on the sign seemed to mock her, a cruel jest in a land where the tyrannical grasp of the junta held sway. Burma, a nation shrouded in the shadows of despotism, had known no other rule since the coup of '62. The Saffron Revolution, a fleeting moment of defiance, had kindled in the hearts of its people, but the flames of hope were soon extinguished by the brutal hand of the military.\n\nMonks, their saffron robes a stark contrast to the darkness that enveloped them, had marched into the streets, only to be met with violence and bloodshed. The bodies of the fallen littered the streets, their numbers lost in the abyss of official silence. A Japanese journalist, Kenji Nagai, had paid the ultimate price for bearing witness to the atrocities, his death a grim reminder of the junta's unyielding grip on power.\n\nSuch is the lot of humanity, forever bound to the whims of those who would seek to control and oppress. The desire for absolute rule is an ancient curse, one that has infected the hearts of men since the dawn of civilization. The Roman emperors, gods in their own minds, had claimed dominion over their subjects, while the Japanese emperors were believed to be divine, guiding their people through the darkness of history. And in our own time, the echoes of this madness persist, a chilling refrain that has become all too familiar.\n\nThe ghosts of Tiananmen Square, where protesters had dared to challenge the all-powerful Chinese regime, still lingered, their numbers lost in the void of official reportage. The Rwandan genocide, a systematic slaughter of the innocent, had left an indelible stain on the collective conscience. And the Third Reich, that abomination of Nazi Germany, had shown the world the unspeakable horrors that men could inflict upon one another in the name of power and supremacy.\n\nIn this, our world remains unchanged, a realm of darkness and despair, where the strong prey upon the weak and the voices of the oppressed are drowned out by the cacophony of oppression. The sign on Ellen Page's cardboard, a bleak and haunting reminder of the abyss that yawns before us, serves as a testament to the enduring legacy of humanity's capacity for cruelty and despair.",
            "In the vast expanse of Duke Ellington's legacy, his longevity stands as a testament to the boundless creative fires that burned within him. As a maestro, he wove a tapestry of sound that was at once both intricate and sublime, his pianist's touch a subtle undercurrent that coursed through the very fabric of his compositions. In those selected for this assignment, Ellington's presence on the piano is a whispered promise, a gentle reminder of the masterful hand that guided the orchestra's trajectory.\n\nYet it is in his role as composer that Ellington's true genius shines forth, a rich tapestry of sound that showcased the individual threads of his band members. He crafted the framework for soloists to unfurl their improvisational wings, to soar on the thermals of his carefully orchestrated phrases. The result was a music that danced with the particular style of each player, a symphony of sounds that coalesced into a coherent and original whole.\n\nIn the early work Creole Love Call, Ellington revealed a prophetic vision of the voice as a jazz instrument, a lyre that sang with the raw emotion of the human heart. This bluesy dirge, with its deliberate twelve bars, demonstrated a prescience that would become a hallmark of his career – the ability to complement the unique timbre of his soloists, to coax from them a music that was at once both personal and universal. The piece unfolds in six choruses, each a chapter in the narrative of sound:\n\nThe first chorus, a call and response between voice and reeds, begins with a smooth, melodic tone, only to give way to a rougher, more guttural sound. The second chorus, a muted trumpet solo, elaborates on the basic melody, its blue notes stretching out like a supplicant's plea.\n\nThe third chorus, a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, is backed by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase that is at once both propulsive and hesitant. The fourth chorus, a full-band reprise of the first, features a call and response between the brass and reed sections, a swirling vortex of sound that threatens to consume all in its path.\n\nThe fifth chorus, the climactic peak of the piece, sees the reeds take up the call, their high register piercing the air like a cry of despair. The brass and rhythm sections, in syncopated stop-time, add a rhythmic counterpoint that underscores the emotional intensity of the moment.\n\nThe final chorus returns to the structure of the first, the voice now adopting the growl technique, soloing as an instrument. The tag, a brief coda, features a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, a final, jarring note that hangs in the air like a challenge.\n\nIn this work, Ellington's use of voice as a dimension of tone color is but one example of a stylistic trait that would come to define his oeuvre. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, he would combine his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, coaxing a rich and complementary sound from the call and response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) would extend these ideas, as Ellington would use Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone, the sound a perfect distillation of the music's driving, irresistible energy.",
            "A gnawing void had long resided within her, a hollowness that defied satiation. It had taken root at the tender age of fourteen, when the world's vast expanse began to unfold before her. Three years had since elapsed, yet the ache persisted, refusing to be sated. Her desires, once fixated on material possessions, had shifted to a yearning for human connection, but none had managed to stir within her a spark of interest. The attentions of suitors had been a comical spectacle, their attempts to woo her a clumsy exercise in futility. She had often found herself lost in introspection, searching for a plausible explanation for this peculiarity, but the theories that arose only served to deepen the mystery.\n\nHer home was a sanctuary, a refuge from the tempests that raged outside. Her parents, tranquil souls, moved through life with an unshakeable calm, their disagreements a rarity. When they did occur, it was usually a result of her unbridled spirit, a force that threatened to upend the equilibrium of their serene existence. Yet, she was a kindred spirit, a paradox of contradictions that drew people to her like moths to flame.\n\nBut today, the stillness was shattered. As she wandered through the rooms, searching for inspiration, a cry pierced the air, followed by the faint murmur of her mother's voice. The kitchen, once a place of warmth and comfort, had become a scene of distress. Her mother lay on the floor, her eyes clouded with pain, her breaths staccato and labored. She rushed to her side, her own heart racing in tandem with her mother's distress. \"Mom... Mom, what's wrong?\" she exclaimed, her voice trembling with concern. Her mother's words tumbled forth in a rush, a jumbled mix of pain and urgency. \"Ow... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The daughter's hand instinctively grasped her mother's, offering what little comfort she could. \"Where can I pick you up, Mom?\" she asked, her voice steady despite the turmoil within. Her mother's directions were fragmented, but the daughter's training had prepared her for this moment. She lifted her mother with a strength born of desperation, her heart aching with every step. The drive to the hospital was a blur, her mind focused solely on her mother's needs.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic atmosphere only served to heighten the sense of unease, but she was oblivious to the fear that clung to her like a shroud. Her sole concern was her mother's well-being. She carried her to the examination room, her voice calling out to the doctors in a steady, urgent tone. The medical staff rushed to her side, their faces etched with concern. A rolling bed was summoned, and her mother was laid upon it, her daughter left to sit, her heart heavy with worry. The diagnosis was a simple one: her mother had fallen from a precarious perch, a stepping stool, while reaching for a vase.",
            "The sun-scorched land of morbidity stretched out before us, a barren expanse of heart disease and stroke that threatened to consume the lives of countless women.  Yet, like a beacon of hope in the desolate wasteland, the Mediterranean Diet stood tall, its virtues extolled by the dusty tomes of science.  The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a measure of adherence to this sacred creed, was found to be inversely linked to the specter of chronic heart disease and stroke, that twin demons that stalked the night, whispering the names of the fallen to the wind.\n\nThis study, a prosaic exercise in the pursuit of knowledge, sought to unravel the mysteries of the aMed diet, a modified variant of the Mediterranean Diet's sacred precepts.  By emphasizing the consumption of plant foods, those verdant denizens of the earth, and eschewing the unwholesome presence of saturated fats, those dark and malevolent forces that seek to destroy, the aMed diet promised a path to redemption.  The inclusion of fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, those pillars of a just diet, served as a bulwark against the ravages of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe ancients had spoken of the Mediterranean Diet's virtues, but this study sought to delve deeper, to pierce the veil of doubt and uncertainty that shrouded the darkness of stroke and stroke mortality.  Prior studies had hinted at the diet's efficacy in vanquishing the specter of cardiovascular mortality, but the silence was broken by the sound of the aMed diet's drumbeat, beating out a rhythm of hope in the hearts of the faithful.\n\nIn the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without the stain of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, a tale of endurance and survival was written.  For twenty years, they walked the path of the aMed diet, their footsteps measured by the self-reported food frequency questionnaires, those pages of parchment that held the secrets of their daily bread.  The validation of these reports, a ritual of fire and purification, was performed by the sacred texts of medical records and death certificates.\n\nYet, even as the darkness gathered, the women of this study stood firm, their resolve unwavering in the face of the void.  Their bodies, measured by the yardstick of body mass index, smoking status, and aspirin use, told a tale of resilience, of a people unbroken by the trials of the aMed diet.  As they walked the path of the diet, their cumulative averages of the aMed score, like the steady beat of a drum, measured out the rhythm of their progress.\n\nThe Cox proportional-hazard modeling, a sacred arithmetic of risk and reward, revealed the hidden truths of the aMed diet.  And lo, the women who walked the path of the diet, those who heeded the call of the aMed score, were found to be at lower risk of heart disease and stroke, their footsteps measured by the relative risk quotient.  In the top quintile of the aMed score, a realm of plenty and abundance, the women stood, unbroken and unafraid, their hearts beating to the rhythm of a healthier life.",
            "In the ravaged landscape of the American experience, a calamity unfolded in the year 2007, a year that would come to be known as the nadir of a long descent into economic ruin. The economic behemoths of the nation crumbled beneath the weight of their own hubris, their colossus-like structures tumbling to the ground like the idols they had become. The people suffered, their livelihoods reduced to ashes, their futures incinerated by the very fires of speculation and greed that had fueled the engines of progress.\n\nThe rot that had taken hold ran deep, its roots tracing back to the year 1999, a time when the nation's leaders, blinded by their own ambition, had begun to tamper with the delicate machinery of the economy. The Clinton administration, driven by a hunger for power, had relaxed the reins of restraint, allowing the wolves of speculation to roam free. And so, Fannie Mae, that behemoth of the mortgage industry, was goaded into extending its reach, casting its net far and wide in search of the vulnerable and the gullible. The siren song of easy credit had begun to beckon, and the people, ensnared by the promise of a better life, had answered.\n\nThe warning signs had been there, visible to all who cared to see. In the pages of the New York Times, a prescient voice had sounded the alarm, cautioning against the dangers of a house of cards built on shifting sands. \"Fannie Mae,\" Steven Holmes had written, \"the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" And then, in a phrase that would prove to be a prophecy, he added, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nBut the warnings had fallen on deaf ears, and the economy careened forward, fueled by the toxic fumes of speculation and greed. The new and complex structures of mortgage-backed securities, CDOs, and adjustable-rate mortgages had created a Frankenstein's monster of finance, a creature that had lost all control, its fate sealed. The sectors of the economy had become intertwined, a vast and intricate web of debt and obligation, a house of cards that would soon come crashing down.\n\nAnd down it came, with a crash that shook the very foundations of the nation. The top five U.S. investment banks, once the titans of finance, were brought low, their losses totaling $4.1 trillion, a staggering sum that would leave the nation reeling. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, those behemoths of the mortgage industry, stood at the precipice, their combined debt of $5 trillion a weight that threatened to consume them whole. And so, in September 2008, they were brought under government control, a desperate attempt to salvage what was left of the economy.",
            "In the desolate expanse of narrative, there exists a barren stretch known as exposition.  A place where the writer's wings, once poised to take flight, instead falter and wither in the arid air.  The reader, a traveler in this unforgiving land, stumbles upon a wasteland of words, where the magnetic pull of the writer's prose is lost to the void.  Dr. Merlin, a sage guide in this wilderness, is known to bemoan the fate of such passages, her voice rising in frustration as the words blur before her eyes.\n\nExposition, that insidious whisper in the writer's ear, tempts her to reveal the hidden truths, to lay bare the skeletal framework of the story.  But it is a siren's call, luring her down the rocky shores of prose, where the reader's interest founders and the narrative succumbs to the undertow of tedium.\n\nThe familiar mantra, \"Show, don't tell,\" echoes through the halls of writing wisdom, yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in the quagmire of exposition, her words a jumbled mass of information, a cacophony of fact and fiction.  The devil that sits upon her shoulder, urging her to reveal the backstory, the history of the characters' lives, is a constant companion, a shadow that haunts her every move.\n\nTo illustrate the folly of exposition, let us consider a tale of love and loss.  A heroine, her heart aflame with passion, meets her beloved in a moment of time, their love blossoming like a wildflower in the desert.  But their marriage is reduced to a few stilted lines, a cursory nod to the depth of their emotions.  The husband, a man whose love is as vast as the desert itself, is reduced to a mere specter, a fleeting presence in the heroine's life.  His murder, a brutal act that shatters the fragile bonds of their love, is met with a sparse display of emotion, the heroine's grief a mere whisper in the wind.\n\nThe proper rendering of this tale would be to give substance to the bare bones of the narrative.  To show, not tell, the depth of the heroine's emotions, the richness of her love for the husband.  To reveal, through the prism of her eyes, the world that she saw through his, the hopes and dreams that he instilled in her.  Only then, in the midst of this rich tapestry, can the reader truly mourn the loss of the husband, and in doing so, come to know the heroine in all her complexity.\n\nAs writers, we must strive to infuse the narrative with the meat of life, to make the simple storyline a testament to the human experience.  We must eschew the temptation to rush past the nuances of character, to reveal the hidden depths of their souls.  For in the end, it is not the exposition that matters, but the world that we create, the lives we touch, and the emotions we evoke.",
            "The evening sun had long since surrendered to the shadows as I sat transfixed before the glowing rectangle, the hum of the television a morbid serenade. The faces of two local newscasters leered back at me, their words a litany of the day's atrocities. From Columbus, Ohio, the news poured in like a relentless rain, each story a minor tremor in the ongoing earthquake of humanity's worst excesses.\n\nThe first report was a jerky, disjointed thing, a snippet of live broadcast from an earlier morning. A man, Shad Hostettler, his features twisted into a visage of malevolence, stared back at me from the screen. His wife, nameless and faceless, a mere prop in his dark design, had been the target of his madness, her body a canvas for his brutal art. The news anchor's voice droned on, a monotone litany of fact and speculation, before moving on to the next tale of woe.\n\nThe second story, a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, was a cold, clinical thing, devoid of passion or conviction. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, lay critically wounded, his fate a precarious balance of life and death. The authorities, a parade of uniforms and badges, marched in to investigate, their words a hollow promise of justice. But I knew, in that moment, that this story would be but a footnote in the grand tome of human suffering. The victims of a black neighborhood were often forgotten, their stories reduced to a mere whisper, a ghostly echo that faded into the ether.\n\nThe newscasters moved on, their words a blur of indifference, as they spoke of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. The bullet, a .22 caliber pellet from a rifle, had pierced the metal skin of the aircraft, a tiny, insignificant thing in the grand tapestry of the universe. And yet, a reward was offered, a paltry sum of five thousand dollars, a feeble attempt to salve the wound of a community's outrage.\n\nThe forecast, a meandering thing, spoke of rain and thunderstorms, a minor perturbation in the grand dance of the weather. The temperatures, a mere trifle, would remain in the mid-to-low eighties, a trivial concern in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAnd so the newscasters moved on, their words a litany of petty crimes and inconsequential events. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF, a store clerk's tale of a dark-skinned black man, his features a mere caricature, his crime a trivial thing in the grand ledger of humanity's sins. The words dripped with a subtle venom, a subtext that spoke of fear and prejudice, a whispered promise of a world where some lives were worth less than others.\n\nFinally, a convicted man, Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin, was paraded before the camera, his face a mask of defiance. His crime, a conspiracy to distribute marijuana, a trivial thing in the grand scheme of things. His sentence, a mere 300 months, a paltry sum in the face of humanity's vast and unforgiving landscape. And yet, his ethnicity, a Hispanic man, was trotted out, a tired trope, a worn and dusty phrase, a reminder that in this world, some lives were worth less than others.",
            "In the crucible of brotherhood, a bond is forged that cannot be broken, a bond that festers with the contradictions of love and cruelty, of pride and jealousy. It is a bond that allows brothers to see themselves in one another, to behold their own reflection staring back, unflinching and unyielding. And it is in the depths of desperation, when all hope seems lost, that this bond is revealed in all its twisted glory. The consequences of this bond are dire, a reckoning that is paid in full with every cruel thought and every tender gesture.\n\nIn the desolate landscape of \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers embark on a futile journey, their bond tempered by the unforgiving forces of nature. The clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a fever pitch in a climactic moment of truth, leaving only one brother to escape the devastating consequences. Through the eyes of the narrator, we are granted a glimpse into the inner workings of the protagonist's fractured psyche, a world where the lines between love and hatred are blurred beyond recognition.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to the devouring power of pride. From the outset, his relationship with his brother Doodle is marked by resentment, a seething anger that festers in the face of the little boy's crippled form. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who would be his companion in every sense, a partner in adventure and a mirror to his own soul. But Doodle's fragile heart, a constant reminder of the cruel hand that fate had dealt him, was a bitter pill to swallow. The memories of their early days together, of the things they would never do, of the dreams that would never be realized, still lingered, a festering wound that refused to heal.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of this unyielding despair, a glimmer of hope flickered to life. The small boy's smile, a radiant beam of light in a world gone dark, pierced the protagonist's heart, a reminder of the love that lay hidden beneath the surface. It was a love that was not strong enough to conquer the crushing weight of his own desires, but it was enough to stay his hand, to prevent the unforgivable act of infanticide that had lurked in the shadows of his mind. In that moment, the protagonist saw the truth of his own nature, a truth that was both beautiful and brutal, a reflection of the bond that had forged him into the person he was.",
            "The human brain - a labyrinthine repository of circuitry and cognition, its workings as inscrutable as the dark recesses of the earth.  As the machinery of technology has advanced, so too have the metaphors we employ to grasp its essence.  We once conceived of the brain as a wax tablet, receiving impressions of the world like the soft, yielding surface of a page.  Later, it was likened to a papyrus scroll, unrolled and inscribed with the intricate hieroglyphics of thought.  And more recently, we have come to see it as a calculating device, a machine of cold efficiency, processing data with the speed and precision of a well-oiled automaton.  Yet these analogies, though clever, are ultimately feeble attempts to capture the fullness of its mystery.\n\nInformation, a constant influx of sensory impressions - the tactile caress of the sun on skin, the cacophony of sound that assaults the eardrums, the photons that dance across the retina - is transformed, transmuted by the brain's dark alchemy into a language of electrical signals that course through its tangled network like a river through the desert.  This machinery of perception is a double-edged sword, cutting both ways: on one hand, the bottom-up process, a slow and laborious assembly of the most basic components - color, shape, texture - into a coherent whole; on the other, the top-down process, a swift and intuitive leap, guided by the accumulated wisdom of past experiences, to a recognition that is both instantaneous and profound.\n\nBut even as the information is processed, an unseen hand, the attention filter, intervenes, deciding what is worthy of notice, what is to be set aside, and what is to be forgotten.  It is a gatekeeper, a sentinel that stands at the threshold of awareness, admitting only what is deemed necessary, rejecting the rest.  Thus, in the midst of a riotous din, we may pluck out the melody of our own name, a thread of meaning that stands out against the tapestry of dissonance.\n\nAnd yet, for all its seeming complexity, the brain's basic function - the storage of information - is a simple, yet profound one.  There are the three levels of memory: the sensory, a fleeting impression, a snapshot of the moment; the working, a delicate dance of electrical signals that shimmers and fades like a firefly in the night; and the long-term, a repository of knowledge, a library of the past, where the accumulated wisdom of centuries is inscribed upon the walls of the mind.\n\nThe models of how this knowledge is organized are legion, each one a reflection of our own imperfect understanding of the brain's labyrinthine depths.  Some are based on the human experience, a map of memories etched upon the surface of the mind; others, on the cold, unforgiving logic of computer science; and others, on the twitching, electrical impulses that course through the body.  And yet, no matter the model, the truth remains elusive, a will-o'-the-wisp that beckons us deeper into the darkness, deeper into the heart of the human brain.",
            "In the desolate landscape of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley's scathing critique of the forthcoming specter of technology and the fetid underbelly of capitalism unfurls like a dark tapestry. This dystopian world, where the masses toil in servitude to the dictates of the World Controller, is a testament to the pernicious effects of a system that values conformity above the solitary flame of individuality. From the very inception, the inhabitants are indoctrinated with a numbing mantra of hedonistic pleasure, their desires tempered by the stultifying hand of conditioning. Beneath this façade, a more sinister reality lurks, where the common folk are reduced to pawns in a grand game of ideological manipulation.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist dialectics, Huxley's masterpiece reveals the undercurrents of suspicion towards the burgeoning economy of his time. The pervasive use of terms like homogeny and reification serves as a testament to the author's unease with the emerging order. The specter of capitalism looms large, its true nature obscured by the smokescreen of false consciousness. Like a thief in the night, it steals the proletariat's awareness of their own condition, rendering them mute and acquiescent to the whims of their betters.\n\nThe lower echelons of society, the Deltas and Gammas, are reduced to automatons, their wills supplanted by the insidious whisper of hypnopædia, which exhorts them to indulge, to consume, to surrender to the void. And at the helm of this charnel house, the World Controller reigns supreme, a master puppeteer manipulating the strings of the masses. Hegemony, that insidious force that reduces social classes to a mere plaything of the powerful, holds sway in this bleak world, where the lower classes are complicit in their own oppression, their very existence a testament to the efficacy of the system.\n\nIn this world devoid of passion, of true connection, of genuine relationships, Huxley reveals the sterile, loveless existence that arises from the marriage of technology and capitalism. The characters, once they attempted to be flesh and blood, now reduced to cardboard cutouts, their interactions a hollow mockery of human connection. Their words, a litany of shallow trivialities, a paean to the vacuous idol of physical appearance. And in the societal classes' complete acceptance of their station, we see the Marxian thesis of the proletariat's false consciousness writ large, a testament to the insidious power of the system to reduce humanity to a mere abstraction, a cog in the machine of oppression.",
            "The dusty expanse of University Park has been my domain for nigh on two and a half years now, a score of semesters creeping by like dark hours in the night. For many, the very notion of navigating its twisting paths and broad thoroughfares is a Sisyphean task. I recall my earliest days, lodged in the dormitory of East Halls, a distant outpost on the farthest rim of the campus, the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center looming like sentinels beyond the horizon. The trek from my humble abode in Stuart Hall to the hallowed halls of Willard, a bastion of learning situated at the very heart of the campus, would often consume a quarter of an hour, the rain-soaked streets and wind-whipped leaves conspiring to slow my progress. And yet, I was not alone in my plight. A chance encounter with a seasoned alumnus, a man not many years my elder, revealed to me a tale of yore, a time when the East Halls stood isolated, ringed by a vast expanse of vacant land. The years have passed, and that desolate terrain has given way to a tapestry of sports fields, grand edifices, and apartments, a sprawling metropolis that has only served to heighten the sense of disconnection. As the campus continues to sprawl, the very fabric of our daily lives becomes increasingly enmeshed in the struggle to traverse its length and breadth. In this wilderness of pavement and steel, the humble bicycle stands as a beacon of hope, a means of locomotion that transcends the limitations of foot and wheel. But alas, the bike itself is a mere tool, a mere instrument, and it is the will of the rider that must be steeled to wield it. The campus, too, must be reshaped to accommodate the needs of its two-wheeled citizens.\n\nI chanced upon a friend, a man who had recently rediscovered the joys of cycling after a protracted absence. His words still linger in my mind: \"Bikes are a revelation,\" he said, his voice laced with a hint of wonder. \"For a time, it wasn't fashionable to ride, but now I see it as the only reasonable way to traverse this vast expanse.\" And indeed, the bicycle offers a clarity of purpose that is hard to find in the hurly-burly of daily life. A simple bowl of oatmeal and the gentle toil of pedaling can carry one farther than the eye can see. I, too, have found myself bound to the campus's periphery, a captive of the off-campus world. And yet, the acquisition of a bike has proven to be a stroke of wisdom, a decision that has shaved precious minutes from my daily routine. The Thomas building, a bastion of learning and knowledge, lies within easy cycling distance, a mere five minutes from my doorstep, should I pedal with haste. Alas, the road that stretches between my home and my destination, Pollock Road, is a pathway fraught with peril, a serpentine course that twists and turns through the heart of the campus. It is a route that tests the mettle of even the most resolute cyclist. And yet, it is a path I must tread, for without my bike, the only alternative would be a pedestrian's plodding pace, a journey that would consume a full half-hour, nay, an hour, of my precious time. The arithmetic is stark: an additional two and a half hours each week, lost in the mire of walking, a sum that I can ill afford."
