            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I aim to follow a path with the Division of Family and Children Services, to aid those children who have been afflicted with the scourge of abuse and neglect, and to lend support to troubled families. The values that I bring to this field are service, respect, an unwavering ethical posture, and a commitment to foster relationships and enhance my professional competence. These are not merely values for social work, but core principles that guide my personal life as well.\n\nI have long harbored a desire to assist others, yet was uncertain of the path I should tread. Through my years in high school and college, I witnessed many souls fleeing from their troubles in a dance of denial, and some resorting to coping mechanisms that were less than noble. These encounters steered me towards a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, though I remained uncertain of my career path. Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break from my academic pursuits. One day, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who sat nervously on her couch, seeking refuge from his abusive parents. When she revealed the reason for his visit, I felt compelled to act. I drove to his parents’ residence the next day, offering my assistance to the police who were at a loss. They requested that I speak to the parents, and I obliged. The parents, however, seemed anxious and offered excuses, painting their son as a manipulative figure who involved outsiders in trivial disputes. This encounter sparked a deep consideration within me, leading me to contemplate a career in social work.\n\nSocial justice is another value that resonates strongly within the field of social work. Our society lauds the individual and mourns those who have passed, yet the notion of the individual seems more an echo of ancient traditions than a true reflection of uniqueness. If we mourn the loss of individuals, why do we strive to conform to the image of 'everyone else'? I stand as an individual, unbound by the constraints of societal norms. Throughout my education, I have been a beacon against social injustice: coloring my hair in hues that defied conventional wisdom, donning clothing that spoke to my true self, piercing my ears beyond the point of tradition, declaring my involvement with the GSBA, and standing against both racism and discrimination. I am a champion of social justice, and I shall continue to fight against the injustices that plague our world.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the mind, the specter of insomnia haunts the slumbering faculties, an eternal vigilant sentinel upon the threshold of the dreamless abyss. This very paper delves into the abyssal depths of the biological and sociocultural models, seeking to illuminate the enigmatic paths that lead to this nocturnal affliction. The biological model, a grim tapestry woven with the threads of genetic heritage and medical malady, posits that the roots of insomnia lie in the dark recesses of the human genome, where the whispering winds of inheritance and the clattering cogs of physiologic machinery conspire to disturb the natural ebb and flow of sleep. The sociocultural model, on the other hand, traces the tendrils of insomnia through the tangled web of environmental relationships, where race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status entwine to cast their shadows upon the restless soul.\n\nThe paper weaves a tapestry of research, each thread a glinting shard of insight, each knot a paradoxical truth. The biological model, like some ancient monolith, looms over the landscape, its secrets whispered in the rustling leaves of scientific inquiry. A study of mice, those perpetual harbingers of human frailty, reveals that the delicate mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness are governed by the orexin neurons, in turn regulated by the GABAB receptors. The activation of these receptors, like some ancient rite, induces the profound embrace of sleep. But a disruption, like a favored stone pushed from its perch, can send the delicate balance askew, and insomnia takes its grim toll. The implications, both genetic and environmental, are as vast and complex as the human experience itself.\n\nThe sociocultural model, a labyrinth of interconnected pathways, seeks to unravel the intricate dance of insomnia and the human condition. It is a study of the shadows cast by the sun, of the way that the light refracts and bends, creating a world of complexity and nuance. The paper weaves a tale of two models, each one a stark silhouette against the backdrop of the human experience, each one a testament to the power of science to illuminate the darkness.\n\nIn the end, the paper stands as a beacon, a lighthouse in the storm-tossed sea of insomnia. It is a call to arms, a rallying cry for those who would seek to understand the enigma of sleep and its elusiveness. It is a testament to the power of the human spirit, to its ability to transcend the darkness and find its way home, one dream at a time.",
            "In the twilight of human understanding, there exists a malady known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a condition wherein the central nervous system, that silent, labyrinthine realm of the brain, fails to receive and decipher the whispers of sound as it should. Those afflicted with CAPD, it is important to note, possess ears that function as they ought. Yet, the bridge between sound and comprehension, that tenuous connection between the outer world and the inner, is askew.\n\nThe origins of this disorder can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when the likes of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari sought to unravel the mysteries of communicative disorders in children. Their work laid the groundwork for the field, and it was Kimura who, in 1961, introduced the world to dichotic testing. This was a turning point, a moment when the physiology of the central nervous system was first truly understood in relation to the processing of sound.\n\nThe symptoms of CAPD are as varied as the stars in the night sky. Those who suffer may find it difficult to pinpoint the source of a sound, to differentiate between the cacophony of voices in a crowded room, or to recognize the subtle patterns within speech. They may struggle to discern the tone of a voice, or the sequence in which sounds occur. Their ears, like a faulty radio signal, may be swamped by the din of the world, leaving them with a cacophony that is lost and disjointed.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a complex affair, a dance of observation and measurement. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, armed with their tools and their keen eyes, must pore over the patient's responses to auditory stimuli. They may present the patient with a battery of tests, each one a puzzle piece in the grand jigsaw of diagnosis. There is no singular test, no holy grail of auditory function. The cause of CAPD, like the wind, is ever elusive.\n\nYet, despite the darkness that has shrouded CAPD for so long, there is hope. For in the realm of the mainstream classroom, there are those who stand as beacons of light. Teachers, armed with patience and understanding, can assist those who suffer from CAPD. They can create an environment where the whispers of sound are not lost but heard, where the cacophony of the world is not a barrier but a challenge to overcome.",

For in the end, the self must cast off its disguise, lest it be lost forever in the labyrinth of pretense. The unraveling of such a deception, however, comes at a cost. For some, it is a cost of solitude, a chasm that opens between the deceiver and those they have sought to deceive.\n\nThe theme of deception in role reversal, particularly that of gender, is a tangled web. Why, one might ask, does the subject feel the need to discard their true self and assume a new guise? In Viola's case, it is a matter of survival. New to a strange land, she believes that the disguise of a man will protect her from the predations of her new world. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from the solace of her own sex, leaving her adrift. Her deception does not go unnoticed, for Olivia mistakes her for her twin brother, Sebastian, and falls in love with her. Yet, she finds herself entangled in a web of her own making, for she harbors feelings for Orsino, feelings she must suppress. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me,\" he says.\n\nYet, in this tale of deception, there is a glimmer of something more. Perhaps Shakespeare was illuminating a path to the unveiling of hidden emotions, a path that deception can sometimes pave, if only for a moment. For instance, is Olivia's love for Cesario a love of the body, or is it something deeper? Does she love Cesario because he is a man, or does she love Viola, the woman hidden beneath the disguise? The play hints at this, for Olivia's affections shift swiftly, as if she were a bird caught in a storm. She calls Viola her \"sister,\" not her lover.",
            "In the annals of colonization, German rule is oftentimes castigated for its harshness, most notably in the realm of the Ovaherero and Nama in German Southwest Africa. Yet, to apprehend the entirety of such an expansive empire, one must not succumb to a facile summation. The German colonial domain, as varied as the landscapes it encompassed, bore a panoply of policies and governance styles. Educational provisions mirrored this diversity, with the British, upon inheriting German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, discovering a populace well-versed in literacy and learning.\n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (now Namibia) presented a stark tableau. Unlike in East Africa, where the government embraced a prominent role in educating the natives, the task in South West Africa was largely relegated to missionary societies, with scant government support. Meanwhile, the government lavished resources on European education, establishing a state school system and heavily supporting and regulating missionary institutions. These educational policies had enduring effects, even after the waning of German rule. While other German colonies boasted literate and educated natives, in South West Africa, the majority remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\n\nThe divergence in South West Africa's educational experience was born of multifarious factors—social, political, and economic in nature. This inquiry seeks to elucidate these factors, with particular attention to recent research on the stances adopted by settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nAn ample corpus of literature explores education in the German colonial empire, much of it in German and penned in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the era of German rule. These early works were primarily descriptive, chronicling the educational systems of these colonies. Subsequent English-language works broadened the discourse through comparative studies and more granular analyses. These studies revealed stark differences in educational systems across colonies. Among the most prominent works is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies, elucidating the factors accounting for their disparities. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population of South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate was moderately temperate, though much of the territory was arid desert. This hospitable climate fostered a relatively large European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites inhabited South West Africa, compared to merely 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded over the past century, encompassing so many genres that a comprehensive list is challenging to compile. The genre's complexity is further compounded by the proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within each domain. The evolution of Heavy Metal, a sub-genre of rock, is a testament to this diversity and expression. Born from the crucible of the late 20th century, Heavy Metal has evolved into one of the most multifaceted and emotionally charged genres of music, its influence permeating the modern musical landscape.\n\nThe birth of Heavy Metal was marked by a surge of creativity and experimentation, as musicians embraced the genre's potential for dark exploration. It is a music of extremes, characterized by a brutal honesty and a willingness to delve into the abyss of human emotion. The genre's origins can be traced back to the sixties, a time of psychedelic experimentation and cultural upheaval. Bands like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin pioneered Heavy Metal, their music a reflection of the darker side of the human experience.\n\nThe genre's evolution has been marked by a continuous foregrounding of the extreme, a pursuit of the edge. It is a music born of rebellion and defiance, a catharsis for those who seek solace in the shadows. The lyrics of Heavy Metal reflect this, often delving into themes of darkness, violence, and despair. The music is raw, unapologetic, and often brutal, a response to the sanitized world of popular music that preceded it.\n\nHeavy Metal is not merely a genre; it is a movement. It is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and its willingness to confront the darkest aspects of itself. It is a music that demands to be heard, a symphony of sound that challenges the listener and pushes them to the edge. It is a music that refuses to be tamed, a music that is as vast and unpredictable as the human experience itself.",
            "In the annals of time, some decades prior to the surrealists' rendering of their fanciful visions upon canvas, there labored Henri Rousseau, a man who, much like the dreamers in his own paintings, found solace and escape in his dreams. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 masterpiece, is not merely a portrayal of a woman in rapture before a landscape, but a reflection of Rousseau's own personal aspirations and the struggle within his soul. He yearned for recognition, for acceptance, for praise. The path to this dream was fraught with doubt and internal conflict, a choice between conformity and creativity, between mimicry and originality.\n\nTo understand the essence of \"The Dream,\" one must first acquaint oneself with the life of its creator. Born on May 21, 1844, in the small town of Laval, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant. His formal education was limited, and he spent his youth and early adulthood as a customs inspector, earning him the derisive moniker \"douanier.\" A series of tragedies, the death of his first wife and eight infant children, left him with a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief. Painting became his refuge, his new world, his means to escape the harsh realities of life.\n\nRousseau's predicament was understandable, given his circumstances. He was an untrained painter, late to the game as it were, painting amidst the likes of Matisse and others who had already established themselves in the realm of art. Yet, his plight was not merely one of competition, but of acceptance. Jan Gordon, in his book \"Modern French Painters,\" notes the contrast between Matisse's fear of painting tritely and Rousseau's desire for a conventional style that would gain him entrance to the Artiste Français (92).",
            "In the annals of human thought, many a sage has posited a kinship between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I stand in agreement with this notion, for at the very core, there is a reasoning. As Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our knowledge in this life is imparted through instruction or experience. Yet, we seem to imbibe ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching, as Keats intimates. Both are attempts at description, not prescription. Our inquiry into morality and beauty is an endeavor to elucidate why a work of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than dictating rules for judgment or creation. Criticism of art or morals, however, often falls short of encapsulating the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discourse on the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around such concepts as foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, yet these do not encapsulate why it is good art. Instead, when queried about a favored work of art or literature, one commonly hears phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more intricate or critical explanation. I contend that both art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how meticulously we describe the properties of a literary work, there remains a transcendent quality. I believe ethics shares this attribute. As Wittgenstein proclaimed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I posit that it is this 'something,' this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most potent attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics forges a connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so intertwined because we experience both most profoundly at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us at a depth that can be felt, but not fully explained. This bond is even more pronounced in the realm of literature. As McKean asserts, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the expanse of Germania, where the Alps cast their long shadows over München, and the Baltic Sea's cold breath reaches into Kiel, a singular culture unfurls. Köln, nestled along the Rhine, whispers of a tale that echoes through the heart of Germany, all the way to the Elbe that cradles Dresden. This land, a tapestry woven from myriad threads, is the birthplace of a people whose name, Germania, is shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe name's genesis is a labyrinth, with scholars and historians lost in its depths. Tacitus, in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" penned in 98 AD, suggests the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, were the original inhabitants. Caesar, in his \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico,\" used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between his conquered Gauls and those he fought beyond the Rhine. Others suggest the name is derived from the ger, a spear used in battle, or the Old Irish \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" hinting at the Germans' fierce demeanor.\n\nTacitus wrote of the Germans, \"I should regard them as aboriginal, not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by sea that those who sought to emigrate would arrive. Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Germany, with its wild country, inclement skies, sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" The Romans, too, were drawn thither for goods and skills, but their hearts remained in their empire.",
            "Down, I gazed, my mind blank as a sheet of parchment, unspoiled by the labors of ink. Silently, without emotion, my eyes drank in the scene before me. Not so much as a whisper of thought disturbed the quietude of my consciousness, for I was but a vessel, observing with an unyielding eye the tableau unfold. As if I were a spectator at a play, I watched over the bowl of fruit, the rustic table, the kitchen, the dining room, all merging into a single, overwhelming whole. One by one, thoughts entered my mind, each more fleeting than the last, like the shadows cast by the sun's retreat.\n\nA time gone by, an artist I had known had advised me to invest in a certain book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" From my youth, I had yearned to capture the essence of the world around me through lines and form. This book offered a method, a technique that would aid in my pursuit. It taught me to frame the world before me, to distill the chaos into a comprehensible whole. A square, a plain plane, and the complex became simplified, made manageable.\n\nYet, as I stood there, before the bowl, the magnitude of the task before me was too great. I could not muster the artist's gaze, the frame that would transform the scene into something graspable. I was lost in awe, like a child before a grand painting, a novice before the canvas.\n\nMy hand reached for the pencil, the implement of my craft, and the muscles in my arm tightened, then released, as if in an echo of the dance of creation. The water in the bowl was clear, serene, untouched by the chaos that was my thoughts. A single thought remained, a single flicker of inspiration, a brief moment of clarity. But it was not enough. My hand, that had soared with such promise, now struck the toilet, again and again, as if futilely attempting to coax the brown package to dance.\n\nMy mop, heavy in hand, the green tie knotted around my neck, I stared at the offending thing, a rude message left by an unseen hand. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, and then my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my digits like a glove, like a mother's touch. I stood, straight and tall, then bent, my hand dipping into the bowl, like a priest entering the confessional.",
            "The young ones are falling behind the wheel, and the toll is heavy. The National Institutes of Health, in their wisdom, say that the teen brain, in its immaturity, is unfit for the hazards of the road. Simple inexperience, that curse of youth, is the root of the matter. This want of experience leads to more fatal collisions, to rollovers, to speeding, to driving off the path. And when the young ones travel with their peers, as they do, their peril is multiplied. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has shown this correlation: with each passing of the years, the number of accidents increases.\n\nCalifornia and others have tried to ease the burden with provisional licenses, restricting hours and forbidding other minors as passengers. But these are merely bandages on a festering wound. The truth is, as a whole, the youngest drivers are not ready for the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, in his studies, suggests even 18 is too young. USA Today reports that the thrill-seekers among them, those under 19 or 20, are drawn to the danger. To delay driving until the thrill has tempered would be wise. If we continue this reckless course, the death toll will rise, and by 2010, when the Baby-Boomers' children come of age, the road will be littered with the fallen.\n\nThe solution is simple, clear as the desert sky. Schools can teach the young ones to drive, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could be granted, with practical driving hours required, based on the majority of states' standards. The nation, as a whole, should act, not just California or Texas, for the peril is not confined to one state. This legislation is not new, but it is necessary.",
            "In the hallowed halls of the Library of Congress, amidst the dust and the shadows, I discovered a trove of Edison's earliest films, a relic of a time when motion pictures were still in their infancy. Among them, I found fifteen trick films, born of the mind's eye and the flickering light, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These films, like the marionettes they often depicted, danced to the tune of creative editing, conjuring illusions from the simplest of movements. My study of these cinematic sorceries focused on the poetry of their trickery and the peculiar anomalies that bloomed towards the twentieth century's dawn.\n\nThe trick films of yesteryear were bound by the rules of a set-bound stage, a frontal proscenium that mirrored the theatre and vaudeville from whence they came. The camera, a silent sentinel, never strayed from its post, its gaze fixed upon the stationary tableau. Actors moved side-to-side, like players on a stage, never drawing near or receding from the lens. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right, their dance confined to the horizontal, never straying beyond the frame's borders, while the camera remained ever steadfast.\n\nThe compositions were long shots, and rarely medium, the close-up a foreign notion to these early films. It was the theatre's influence, where the audience bore witness to the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's edges. Actors did not approach the camera, nor did they retreat, leaving close-ups as a phantom of a future age.\n\nMost trick films adhered to the rule of one shot, one film, their narratives as fleeting as the actors' movements. Their length was limited to a minute or less, a reflection of the frames per second that dictated their rhythm. Yet, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eye was often a symphony of joined frames, a trick of the light that birthed illusions from the shadows. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" began, yet the film was a singular moment in the viewer's eye, a testament to the trickery at play.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a man possessed by the spirit of Republicanism from its early days. A yeoman farmer at heart, his endeavors in politics and tilling the earth shaped him into a champion of individual liberty and government's role. His belief in an agrarian lifestyle was the bedrock of his philosophical underpinnings, lending a unique hue to his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor saw in the nascent United States a chance to forge an ideal system, unfettered by native traditions that might stifle progress. He held firm the belief in natural rights, interdependent and inviolable, and argued that they should remain beyond the reach of government. He posited that the \"state of nature\" allowed the strong and cunning to thrive, but that civilization must correct this inequity.\n\nHis vision for an ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the good and evil in man. Taylor was rigid in his dualistic moral stance. \"Government is wrought by man,\" he contended, \"and thus, its virtues and vices are human.\" (Ibid., pg. 167) He deemed good principles those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function fairly, despite the inevitable corruption of administration, driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was a constant in man's nature, but only when it extended beyond the common good did it become evil. A good government was necessary to temper man's innate evil, but it must be ever-vigilant to prevent the intrusion of corrupt principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a minimal Federal government, with powers limited to those explicitly stated. He understood the expense and potential despotism of an extensive government, but believed a literal, unreferenced interpretation could become perverted. The Declaration of Independence, he argued, was the true charter of the United States, portraying it as a union of sovereign states rather than a singular nation.",
            "In reference to Figure 17, a stark plummet in commuter log submissions transpired during the third month of our endeavor. Such a precipitous decline was disquieting, and the cause remains elusive. The encroaching winter in our New England locale, coupled with the concluding days of the fall semester, where students and faculty alike are engrossed in their final tasks, may account for some of the decline. December's holiday season, a time of respite and festivity, further distanced many from their daily log submissions. The winter break, extending from December to late January, coincides with a lull in campus activity. Yet, February's anemic submission numbers remain a puzzle. One may conjecture that projects of this nature often experience an initial surge of enthusiasm, subsequently ebbing as novelty wears off. To address this, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a vigorous campaign that reignited log submissions.\n\nAnother challenge faced by our project, or any similar initiative, is the deeply ingrained appreciation for the freedom and independence of driving. This cultural affection necessitates the provision of enticements for alternative modes of commuting. Prizes, such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffeehouses, wellness centers, an independent bookstore, and even national chains, were offered. It is tempting to imagine how larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric vehicles, might have spurred increased participation and mitigated the project's waning engagement. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project. However, if the prizes had been progressively increased, perhaps with the announcement of bicycles in December and hybrid or electric cars in January, participation might have remained steadfast rather than waning.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that mirrors an index or a basket of assets, trading like a stock on an exchange. It offers the diversification of an index fund, the liquidity of single stock ownership, and the ability to short sell or buy on margin. The allure of these benefits is a draw, yet expense ratios are significantly lower than those of mutual funds. However, trading ETFs incurs commissions, akin to stock orders. Moreover, the variety of funds available is vast. Yet, a prudent investor should scrutinize the claims of these benefits, verifying their existence and extent. For this endeavor, we shall examine the ETF IHF, comparing it with its top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF.",
            "In the labyrinthine realm of Edgar Allan Poe's compositions, \"Dream-Land\" emerges as a paragon of his poetic prowess, a testament to his mastery of the written word. Within its stanzas, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" a reference that traces its lineage back to Virgil, who used it to denote the farthest reaches of the known world, an island north of Britain. Though it is certain that Virgil utilized this term, a more contemporary source bears weight in this regard: the works of Goethe, a German author whose influence loomed large over Poe.\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his seminal work \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallel between the two authors' works, concluding that Poe was not merely inspired, but imbued with a profound reverence for Goethe's genius. The Oxford Companion to English Literature elucidates that Goethe was a luminary in the realm of poetic drama, his magnum opus \"Faust\" published in two parts, the latter appearing in the year of Goethe's demise. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" a haunting poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" unfurls, a tale of a king whose wife's passing drives him to the precipice of despair, his grief and solitude echoing through the lines.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking. Poe references Thulé twice in his collected works, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" as bookends for the poem. The landscape of Thulé as described in \"Dream-Land\" — a darkness, a loneliness, haunted by the specters of the past — mirrors the plight of Goethe's king, a chilling doppelganger of Poe's own struggles. It is as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" has stepped into the very heart of Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe's significance as an author was such that Poe would have been acquainted with his works, not merely through direct exposure, but through the many reproductions and translations that followed the original publication. Poe's admiration for Tennyson, when questioned, was a tacit endorsement of this connection, a testament to his respect for the works of the giants who came before him. In this way, \"Dream-Land\" emerges not merely as a poem, but as a dialogue with the literary giants of the past, a testament to Poe's enduring reverence for the works of Goethe.",
            "In the boneyard of California's legal landscape, could a patron who met with calamity, slipping and falling upon a spill of applesauce in a grocer's market, find solace in the award of punitive damages? The judge's gavel would not likely fall to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's suit, for she must demonstrate the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that would befall others, and that the conduct was as vile as the worst of sinners.\n\nPalmer may claim that the store's manager, Paul Martin, should have known the probable harm of leaving a spill unattended, given the multitude of incidents that had befallen others before her. Despite this knowledge, Martin failed to tend to the matter, continuing his meal unperturbed. His failures to clean the spill, despite multiple reports of similar incidents, could be seen as despicable, a reckless disregard for the safety of his patrons.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, 2009, at the fifth hour, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed Martin of an applesauce spill in the aisles. Martin, in the grip of his dinner break, deemed it beneath him to deal with such trifles. Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, also notified Martin of the spill, yet he remained unmoved, his meal his priority. At the half-hour mark, Jennifer Palmer found herself on the ground, her back broken by the fall. Prior to her accident, five others had met with similar fates in 2009.\n\nPalmer seeks recompense from D&D Markets for her injury, and we find ourselves contemplating a motion to dismiss her punitive damage claim. In the golden state, a plaintiff may recover such damages for a breach not arising from contract if the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. The latter is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or absent intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions and deliberately failed to avert them.",
            "Four years hence, I found myself amidst the acrid pages of a course on Islam at CBC. The classroom air thick with argument, the question that hung heavy: was it hostile, this faith? Four years later, the echo of that debate resonates, louder still in the wake of 9/11. Mass media, like a falcon wheeling, shifted from the shadows to the sun, viewing Islam not as foe, but as friend. And yet, in 2001, could we have envisioned a man named Barack Obama, with roots in the Muslim soil, ascending to the highest office of the land?\n\nThe Prophet's Biography, it intrigues me. According to history, Muhammad was no conqueror forcing conversion. Yet, the account paints him as a martyr, misunderstood, humbled. One by one, they came, drawn to the 'truth' in his teachings, like moths to a flame.\n\nThe parallels, they haunt me - Jesus' ministry, Muhammad's miracles. The mutton and milk, multiplied, for forty men. This, the writers' wish: a humble prophet, proven by miracle, not word. It is a theft, a usurping of Christ's glory, a sacrilege.\n\nThe tales of conversion, they reek of deceit. Too many echoes, too many third-party accounts. The truth, it seems, is lost in the whispers. And the reverence for Muhammad, it grates. History, it tells a different tale. The gentle, humble man, he was not. The Muslims, they know not the truth of Muhammad's rise.",
            "The tenets of Christ, his teachings and beliefs, were swiftly abandoned in the crucible of Christian thought that followed his ascension. A glance through the annals of history reveals a relentless drift from the source. The world of today bears witness to an awakening, a progressive surge, yet traditional minds cling to what was instilled in them. They form but a slender wedge against the tide of change. Among the faithful, a yearning will grow, an insatiable hunger to pry apart the layers of doctrine that have been added, one upon the other, like the rings of some ancient, corrupted tree. A reversal, a great reversion, will wash over the land, stripping away the accretions of centuries, until the essence of what Jesus brought to man by the will of God remains, unadulterated. As this tide sweeps across the States and Europe, it will bear with it a fervor, a zeal to worship as those who lived in his time, to follow only his words, his example. The church, that institution, will stand resilient, a beacon amidst the storm, but the theological clock will have turned backwards, and the cornucopia of faith will dwindle into a singular, unifying belief. Divisions will melt away, giving way to a sameness, a uniformity, as we have seen before in the imperious sweep of empires and the rise of leaders. This reversion will not be swift; it may take years, decades, even centuries, but it will come. And it will begin with a reading of Christ's words as metaphor, not dogma. For what has transpired since his time, if we delve far enough into the annals of history, is a story of Judaism, the wellspring of Christianity, a monotheistic faith revealed by God, with the authority of the Hebrew scriptures at its core. The Jewish people were not of one spirit; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority, the common folk.",
            "In The Jungle, Upton Sinclair unveils the stark truth of the human condition, revealing that at our core, we are driven by an insatiable greed and selfishness. We are consumed by the desire to elevate our own station, heedless of those beneath us, who we trample in our relentless pursuit of success. Sinclair's prose is a stark reminder of this reality, as he paints a vivid picture of the towering factories that encroach upon the sky, spewing clouds of inky smoke that choke the air and poison the earth below. The owners and managers, blinded by their ambition, care not for the suffering they cause, neither man nor beast. They are blind to the stench of the animal waste that flows like a river through the streets of Packingtown, unaware of the misery they inflict upon those who toil beneath their watchful gaze.\n\nThe workers themselves are little more than cogs in the vast machinery of progress, their lives expendable in the name of profit. Sinclair writes, \"From the top to the bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds... There is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, nothing to mitigate the harsh treatment of the workers.\" They are forced to work in conditions that bend them to the will of their overlords, their lives hanging in the balance with every shift. The era in which The Jungle is set was one without the protection of laws or regulations, allowing the managers and owners to run roughshod over their employees, driving them to the brink of exhaustion in their quest for wealth. The workers, trapped in this hellish cycle, are left to fend for themselves, without recourse or escape. Sinclair's words are a stark warning, a cry from the depths of Packingtown, where the workers are nothing more than slaves, their lives at the mercy of those who claim to rule them.",
            "In the vast expanse of literary craftsmanship, authors wield diverse techniques to instill in readers a certain hue or sentiment towards pivotal subjects. Among these, F. Scott Fitzgerald deploys a spectrum of methods with masterful precision, notably in his magnum opus, \"The Great Gatsby.\" He often pairs words in an unorthodox manner, forging a unique atmosphere around his subjects. Furthermore, he imbues symbols with meaning, then subtly employs these significations to evoke certain feelings.\n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald painstakingly constructs a lexicon of color, assigning profound implications to hues such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. White and gray, in particular, become symbols of uniformity, with white signifying elegance and refinement, and gray representing decay and age. Fitzgerald's use of these colors commences early in the narrative, establishing their meanings through their recurring appearances. Daisy and Jordan are frequently \"in white,\" while Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's affair, and Tom sports a \"white shirt\" upon meeting Myrtle. In stark contrast, the only departure from this white-washed palette occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Furthermore, Fitzgerald extends this symbolic usage to mundane subjects and characters, depicting common folks and places in shades of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" the valley of ashes is filled with \"gray cars\" and \"gray land,\" and even the Italian child on the railroad is \"gray.\" Once these colors have been sufficiently imbued with meaning, Fitzgerald employs them to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance.\n\nThis technique begins with Daisy, whose portrayal undergoes a shift when she is next described as \"dressed in white,\" driving a \"little white roadster.\" The reader is subtly reminded of her reduced significance, her role as a mere, desired object in Gatsby's life. Fitzgerald continues this approach, highlighting Daisy's \"gray haze of fur collar\" and her subsequent \"white\" dress, further reinforcing her position as a uniform, desired entity.",

Biodiversity thrives where chemicals do not.\n\nThe parcel in question lies at the edge of Potrero, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, a wild and untamed expanse. It is 160 acres of chaparral and oak woodland, a testament to the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, still in its review, recognizes over a hundred species, many endangered. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher call this place home.\n\nThis land, once the domain of Native Americans, was later claimed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. It too, was part of an original homestead, a piece of history etched into the earth. To farm this land, to make a living while preserving its wild heart, is no easy task. But it is a challenge worth undertaking, for the land has much to teach, and the future holds promise.",
            "Culture, like the outlaw in the desert, is a shape-shifter, fluid and unyielding. It is not merely what it is, but what it is not, and what it signifies. A culture is not one thing, but many, a swarm of bees, each stinging with its own particular venom. To understand a culture, one must not rely on broad generalizations, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" For these are as much lies as the truth, and lie in their own right. A negotiator must delve deeper, must understand the spirit of the culture, and how it will sway the table talks.\n\nTo grasp a foreign culture, one must first see it through the prism of their own. Comparisons will arise, but one must not allow them to cloud their judgment. To truly understand, one must study its history, its prejudices, its scars. Not to judge, nor to change, but to accept it as it is, and to work within its boundaries, especially when the table is against you, and you are the one weaker in the game.\n\nA culture is not confined to the borders of a nation, nor the shores of a sea. Within a nation, companies carve their own cultures, like rivers cutting through the landscape. Long hours, relaxed schedules, dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices - all are markers of a company's culture. Some may seem uniform, but beneath the surface lies a world of diversity, like a river beneath the ice. And the values of a culture, they are the heart of it, the reason behind its actions. To understand a culture, one must understand its values, for they are the why behind the what.\n\nTo prepare for the negotiation, one must learn their opponent, on a personal level. For it is not just about the company, but the people within it. Their history, their prejudices, their scars. Only then can the negotiation truly begin.",
            "In the words of the Psalms, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This sentiment echoes through the texts of St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas, as each seeks to justify the existence of the God of the Bible. Let us, for the sake of this discourse, assume the veracity of their beliefs in order to compare their arguments. However, even if we grant their premise, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument, presented in his \"Proslogion,\" leads us inward, urging us to find God within our own consciousness. He posits that God's existence is self-evident, requiring no external evidence. This is a path of faith, a reliance on that which we inherently know. Yet, this reliance on faith, while powerful, leaves a chasm unbridged, a void that logic, the tool of reason, cannot fill.\n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas advances a different path, one of reason and empirical evidence. In his \"Summa Theologica,\" he presents five arguments for God's existence: the argument from change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument points towards the logical necessity of a divine entity. It is as if we are given a puzzle with one piece missing; logic dictates the existence of that piece without needing to see it.\n\nBoth arguments, while compelling in their own right, leave questions unanswered. St. Anselm's reliance on faith may satisfy the spirit, but logic demands more. St. Thomas's reliance on reason, while robust, may be too dry for the soul. Both are incomplete, each only half of a whole.",
            "In the latter half of the sixth century before the common era, a prince of the Sakyan clan, who would one day be known as the Buddha, was born. His life's trajectory would alter the course of history, as his teachings birthed the religion of Buddhism, of which the Theravada sect is the most venerable. Time has worn the face of this faith, as seen in the island nation of Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony persists, a ritual unspoken of in the Buddha's time. monks and laymen alike partake in this ceremony, yet it holds little resemblance to the enlightenment taught by the Sage. These discrepancies stretch from the surface traditions to the very heart of the faith. The Theravada community, be it the monastic or the lay, has had to bend and adapt their doctrinal principles under the forces that have shaped their journey—both friend and foe.\n\nTo navigate this discourse, let us first acquaint ourselves with the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. The faithful seek refuge in the Triple Jewel: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the essence of the Buddha's teachings, is contained within the Tripitaka—the Three Baskets. The Sutta Pitaka holds the sayings of the Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical underpinnings. These include concepts such as Anatta—the absence of a permanent self, Dukkha—the inherent suffering of life, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Recognition of these truths is the key to breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. With this release come the cessation of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules for the layman and monk alike. For the lay, there are the Five Precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not consume intoxicants. For the monk, the path is fraught with many more rules. At the heart of Buddhism lies the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of its cause, the truth of its cessation, and the path that leads to its end.",
            "The United States and Mexico, once locked in an enduring strife that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, are a stark example of such animosity (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The zenith of this enmity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, wherein the United States, with unyielding resolve, bested Mexico and seized Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. The echoes of this conflict, though not as intense, persisted until the dawn of the First World War.\n\nThe roots of this rivalry ran deep and wide, nestled in the very heart of differing beliefs, cultures, and traditions (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). This is not an uncommon tale among nations who share a border; the proximity breeds friction, and rivalries are nurtured in the fertile soil of mutual interests.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher (1977) posits that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations, geographically close to the United States, have harbored deep-seated rivalries, unlike many other nations in Latin America that enjoyed and continue to enjoy cordial relations with the United States.\n\nThe religious divide between the two nations, a common thread throughout history, was a significant obstacle to amiable foreign relations. Sally Frahm (2001) notes, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). The ideological struggle, much like the Cold War, was not merely a competition of political structures but of religious beliefs. The inherent distrust, passed down from their colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, was a formidable barrier between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States over the 57-year period. Most of these disputes were territorial in nature, stemming from border raids from Mexican territory into American lands, and other frontier issues. Bandits and outlaws traversing the American border towns were a persistent problem until both nations marshaled military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) posits that the rivalry began to wane as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and it finally dissipated as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the latter part of the nineteenth century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years hence, I found myself felled by a malady unknown, a specter that had lain dormant, awaiting its moment to strike. I had been a nurse, a vocation chosen from the shadows of a childhood bereft of safety and security. \"There will always be need for nurses,\" they said, and so I chose to tend to the sick, to ease their pain, to make their journey from this world to the next a little less arduous. Yet, even as I stood in the crucible of death and despair, I harbored dreams of discovery and truth, of holding a magnifying glass to the mysteries of life and nature, of bearing witness to the inequities that plague our world. But the call of duty, the echo of voices urging me to provide for those in need, was loud and insistent, and I heeded it.\n\nNow, at forty-six, I am a man adrift, a ship lost at sea, buffeted by the storms of life, with no anchor to hold me fast. Disability has taken its toll, and the specter of poverty is my constant companion. Fifteen years of living on Social Security Disability has left me with naught but the clothes on my back and the memories of a life once lived. Yet, through it all, I have endured, for I have been buoyed by the tides of love and kindness, by the hands of family and friends who have reached out, who have lifted me up when I could not lift myself.\n\nFor what is life but a series of emergencies, great and small? There are no guarantees, no promises written in stone. No matter how we prepare, some things are beyond our ken, beyond our strength. And in those moments, it is compassion that holds us aloft, mutual respect that guides our hands, and the sharing of resources that sustains us.\n\nThe rugged individualism that our forefathers are said to have practiced was not born of isolation, but of community. They did not cross the Rockies alone, but together, in wagon trains, their strength in their shared purpose, their shared hope, their shared struggle. They did not build a nation by going it alone, but by coming together, by trusting one another, by helping one another.\n\nSo, I prepare, as I am wont to do. I have a disaster kit, supplies to see me through the darkest nights, through the harshest storms. I have water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, and duct tape for the windows, flashlights and batteries, candles and matches, canned goods and water. If you have the land and the means, a small farm, a wood stove, preserve your own food. It is wise, it is prudent, it is a hedge against the whims of an uncertain world. But while you are at it, get to know your neighbors. For in the end, it is not the strength of our individual arms, but the unity of our hearts, that will see us through the darkest nights.",
            "Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there shackles that direct the course of their transformation? D'Arcy Thompson, in 1917, confessed that \"even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical tongue the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, the same can be said of today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been employed to examine general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our pursuit is to investigate how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, coupled with experimental studies, can illuminate the mechanisms behind the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental change. We employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to quantify parameters that could subsequently be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could elucidate the boundaries of possible morphological shifts in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend the macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell, in essence, is a tubular structure traversing time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns, known as whorls, spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The pace at which whorls enlarge can vary, with a continuous line separating each, referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, the body whorl, is the last. The spire encompasses all whorls except the final one. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening termed the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nA method for counting whorls is depicted below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical position, then determine where the first suture commences. A line can be drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal constructs its shell. It is possible to trace the aperture’s path via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a formulation is made, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in the Indonesian archipelago has remained stubbornly unchanged over the past decade. Though the nation is well on its way to achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, notably in water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health lags far behind the 2015 targets. The reasons for this disparity are manifold, pointing to a need to fortify the health system rather than merely tinker with specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has shown improvement in the number of births attended by skilled workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. Yet, this figure includes traditional birth attendants like midwives, who are ill-equipped to manage complicated pregnancies, leading to alarming rates of maternal hemorrhage-related deaths. The apparent progress in this indicator is deceiving; there is still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by healthcare professionals, and the issue of postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates nation-wide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain dismally low, hovering around 4%. This statistic further highlights the inequity in healthcare access across urban and rural areas, with rates nearly tripling in urban settings. Moreover, the rich-poor gap in service utilization stands at a staggering 27%, indicating that the poor are disproportionately burdened by out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn contemplating the path forward to improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most pressing question is how to best address the shortage of services. Should Indonesia pursue targeted programmatic approaches or bolster the overall health system, without singling out pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children? Programmatic interventions, with their well-defined, manageable objectives and swift results, are tempting. However, these approaches can lead to resource shifts and duplication of services, ultimately hindering progress.",
            "Victorian novels, those bastions of meticulous detail and genteel aristocracy, are oftentimes constrained by their rigid conventions. Yet, two works of that era, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, stand defiant, their narratives laced with mystery and a peculiar allure that transcends the norms of their time. These novels employ an element of the bizarre, an element that serves to deepen their characters, revealing nuances of their motivations and emotions that would otherwise remain cloaked in shadow.\n\n“And now, a swarm of bewildering thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to walk still between Sikes and Crackit, their voices echoing in his ears, as if the very words they spoke were a specter haunting him. And when he tried to turn his gaze inward, he found himself speaking to them, as if they were not mere figments of his mind, but specters of the night. Suddenly, the report of a gun rang out, a cacophony of cries and shouts filled the air, lights danced before his eyes, and chaos reigned. Through it all, a constant, gnawing pain nagged at him, a relentless torment that refused to abate. (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these novels, the mystery is often invoked through dream sequences or dreamlike states, the content and function of which vary from one instance to the next. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences delve into the depths of Oliver's psyche, exposing his inner turmoil, the pains that haunt him, and the awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event as if in a dream, his struggle to find help a stark reminder of his lack of control over the events that unfolded. The shooting, like a dark storm, numbs his senses, and he is borne away by an unseen hand, his despair renewed yet tempered by the absence of the initial shock of pain. This overwhelming experience raises questions about the will that brought about his misfortune, for it was certainly not his own. It underscores the notion that Oliver is a puppet, his life dictated by forces beyond his control. The shooting also hints at a growing sense of defeat, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair, and robbing him of the ability to react. For, one might expect him to make some effort, even for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – if one could call it a day – for it was gone as soon as it came, and night descended, long and silent, yet fleeting in its dreadful stillness and its brief, screaming darkness.",
            "A time passed, and I found myself within the after-school program, guiding young minds through the labyrinth of learning. My prowess lay in the realms of language and narrative, but fate presented me with a challenge: a boy named Adrian, a third or fourth grader, who found the path of letters treacherous. The peculiarity of his predicament struck me - some letters he knew, others he did not, a dance of comprehension and confusion. His lineage was Latin, his tongue, English, a contradiction in itself. I struggled, until the day his mother walked in, her words as foreign to English as the land she had left behind. With my fledgling grasp of Spanish, we found a means to communicate, and there it was: Adrian could read, his tongue a river of words, but the alphabet, a mystery. The revelation did not change his path, but I hope it has led him to brighter shores.\n\nI share this tale to shed light on the shadows cast by the language barrier in our schools, especially in this land of California. It is not always as plain as it seems, even when a child speaks English with the ease of a native tongue. The struggle is real, and the solution, complex. For Adrian, the answer was simple: tutoring in the alphabet and pronunciation. But for those who speak of English as strangers, the path is longer, the solution, a puzzle of many pieces. No single answer exists, yet all answers must be combined.\n\nFirst, the dual language system, a beacon of hope. Not just for those whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in such programs outperform their peers academically. Fear whispers of wasted resources, but that is a falsehood. If we were to make such programs the norm, all children would benefit. But how? Should all teachers be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable. Yet, why not have special aides, tutors, whose language is a bridge between worlds?",
            "From our earliest days, many are told, in one way or another, that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp, like a distant, flickering flame in the darkness. Some are taken to Sunday school, or temple, or delve within themselves for answers. Others, like I did, reject the given paths, dismissing anything larger than the immediate world of our own making. Yet, we all search for light in the shadows, for a beacon to guide us through the gloom.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, when I asked him his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, my father and I, the rain a steady drumbeat overhead, our cigarettes glowing in the dimming light. The gutters spat water onto the plants, forcing them to yield to the onslaught. He looked out, his gaze distant, a mix of searching and remembrance. His face was gaunt, clothes loose, hair thinned, like the leaves of autumn. He stared into the rain, avoiding my eyes. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to speak of my fear that he might leave me. I hugged him, moved my chair close, and joined him, watching the rain fall.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days past my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had only prolonged his suffering, but he lasted longer than the doctors' projections. I couldn't fathom the purpose of it. God, if He existed, had turned His back on me long ago. In the night, I said no prayers. I couldn't bear to watch him slip away, so I didn't. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he faded. I rolled into a ball in my bed, waiting for the news, but it never came.\n\nNo one called.",
            "The ancient \"Gothic\" novel, in essence and in nomenclature, is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt expounds in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The mode of Gothic has been reviled, revered, and accused of lacking depth, yet celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The inaugural Gothic tale, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, intertwined the remnants of \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances, birthing the nascent Gothic genre and a novel method of literary expression. Walpole wove into his \"Gothic Story\" the trappings of \"old\" theatrical elements and the mimicry of nature in the \"new\" novel form, granting readers a more intimate glimpse into the psyches of characters (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre clings to the medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, even as the term \"gothic\" was in its infancy, denoting archaic or uncouth in the face of societal and literary advancements. The fusion of theatrical Gothic and the novel format, allowing readers a more personal view of characters' psyches, is what has sustained the Gothic for so long, despite its simultaneous obsolescence and novelty to those displaced in time from its inception.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic themes is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both upheld and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is cherished by Gothic writers, for it symbolizes the classic knight—the brave, honorable, and competent warrior—and the perceived lack of this ideal in contemporary society. Walpole, amidst the political turmoil of his time and facing unfair accusations, may have begun to harbor doubts about the morality and innate goodness of his fellow citizens. In his writing, this is reflected in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. The reader is informed before meeting him that he is a prince, has endured tragedy, and is presumed dead at the hands of infidels. His description, which includes such chivalric images, is exaggerated, foreshadowing the trope of excess that would become a staple of Gothic literature (66).",
            "Supply chain management, a labyrinthine dance of goods from the customer's order through the maw of raw materials, to the factory floor and ultimately to the customer's hands, is an intricate web of processes. The term was coined in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant of some renown. He described the process as the planning, implementation, and control of the flow, a symphony of efficiency and quick response to satisfy the customer's hunger.\n\nSix key elements thread through this tapestry: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. It is the responsibility of the business managers to weave these elements into a seamless garment that pleases the customer's palate.\n\nProduction, the first step, is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice rests. It dictates the when, why, where, and how of the goods' creation. Managers must divine the customer's heart's desire, a task best accomplished by scrutinizing the market, the mirror of customer demand. Once this demand is understood, the decision is made: what to produce and in what quantity. The choice of facility, a dance of volume and quality, is next, guided by the customer's satisfaction. Scheduling and equipment maintenance follow, each detail a thread in the fabric of production.\n\nSupply, the second element, is a delicate ballet of strategic decisions and outsourcing partnerships, a way to augment one's core capabilities. A company may have multiple divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the best fit for the various processes. Outsourcing, a means to heighten velocity - the ability to provide quality and flexibility while keeping costs low - may be the chosen path.",

Ellen Page, a girl of Hollywood renown, stands alone, a battered piece of cardboard held aloft, scrawled with a message that sends a chill down the spine. Burma, a land of shadows and sorrows, ruled by a cabal of brutal men who seized power in 1962 with a coupe's swift knife. In 2007, the monks rose, their saffron robes a beacon of defiance. The protests swelled, and the junta's wrath was swift and brutal. Foreign journalists were silenced, their voices snuffed out like dying candles. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, met his end for bearing witness to the streets' rage. The official toll stands at thirteen dead, but the truth is whispered in the shadows, a grim tally of thousands.\n\nThis is not a tale of the new world, but an old one, as old as blood and iron. From the Roman Caesars to the Japanese shoguns, rulers have sought to silence dissent and bend the people to their will. Our own leader, George W.

            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in the realm of jazz is woven from the threads of his longevity and the profound genius that shaped his orchestra. His touch on the piano, though often subtle, is as a master's brushstroke on canvas, subtly guiding the symphony of sound. As a composer, Ellington excelled in crafting intricate tapestries that allowed each band member to shine like a star in the night sky. He forged a framework where a soloist could dance freely, while also penning tightly woven pieces that summoned the unique styles of his musicians to bring forth musical ideas with a clarity that was both singular and original. In doing so, he not only highlighted the tone of the orchestra but also imbued each piece with a unique soul.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its account of Ellington's sound and innovation, points to \"Creole Love Call\" as a testament to his use of voice as an instrument throughout his career. This early masterpiece showcases his ability to add texture and color without the burden of lyrics, a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In this slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition, six choruses unfold like petals of a flower:\n- Chorus 1: The voice begins in a smooth, melodic embrace, then transitions to a rougher, more primal sound.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing extended blue notes that seem to cry out in the night.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase that whispers in the background.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds take the call, answered by the brass and rhythm sections in a thunderous, syncopated stop time.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with the voice taking on the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument, a primal howling.\nThe piece ends with a brief tag, a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, a final flourish that leaves the listener breathless.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded the following year, Ellington's mastery of tight orchestration and his ear for tone color coalesce. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing weave the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further exemplifies this, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone bringing the melody to life, standing tall as a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a tonal instrument is but one example of the multifaceted genius that permeated his work, a testament to his ability to push the boundaries of what jazz could be and to bring forth a sound that was uniquely his own.",
            "In the sullen quiet of her adolescence, a famine gnawed at her soul. A yearning that refused to be sated, it began in the shadow of her fourteenth summer and lingered, an insistent ghost, through her seventeenth. She craved not trinkets nor baubles, but the tangible presence of another. Suitors came, like ants to a corpse, but none piqued her interest. She remained a chaste flower, untouched by the world, her mind a wilderness of questions. What peculiar affliction plagued her spirit, robbing her of the tender embrace of youthful desire?\n\nHer home was a sanctuary, bathed in the soft glow of her parents' affection. They were as calm as the sea, their disagreements as rare as storms. The only tempest that stirred their home was her own spirit, a wildfire that danced on the hearth of her independence.\n\nToday, however, the peace was shattered. She moved through the house like a specter, seeking inspiration that eluded her, when a cry pierced the stillness. Her mother's voice, a symphony of agony, echoed through the house. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart a drumbeat in her chest. \"Mama? Mama, what's wrong?\" Her mother, a crumpled figure on the floor, gasped \"Ow\" with each ragged breath. Her daughter knelt, her hands fluttering like doves. \"Ow... sweet... take me... to the hospital,\" her mother stammered.\n\nShe lifted her mother, a statue of pain, and placed her in the car, the engine's roar a grim symphony.

            "This investigation sought to illuminate the correlation between the strict observance of a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med Diet), as quantified by a robust \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" and the attenuation of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke risk. The aMed Diet, a variation of the Med Diet, is distinguished by its emphasis on plant-based sustenance, including proteins derived from plants (excluding potatoes, but embracing fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (relative to saturated fats) and fish, alongside a reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. A moderate consumption of alcohol is also permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective examinations have demonstrated an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med Diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial posited that the Med Diet proves more efficacious than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. Prior studies, however, did not extend their focus to stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological endeavor tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study encompassing 121,700 female nurses in 11 American states. Over six surveys, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to gauge nutrient intake over the preceding year. Participation exceeded 95% over the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were corroborated through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates, with cases lacking such records classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo mitigate random variability for individuals and accurately represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (combining scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounding factors (variables that could obscure results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, utilizing separate models for fatal and nonfatal instances of CHD and stroke.\n\nIncreased adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, correlated with a decreased risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of surveillance, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Those in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annum of our Lord two thousand and seven, the United States of America succumbed to a ravaging financial calamity. Unemployment swelled, the housing market crumbled, and many a mighty corporation lay in ruin. This recession lingers still, so we must inquire: what was the genesis of this crisis, and how might we prevent its recurrence? In brief, the financial crisis was wrought by selfish and naive political decree, compelling banks and firms to dispense sub-prime loans amidst an immature and insufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coerced into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves bereft of capital reserves, and the chaos was propagated through the repacked mortgages they had hawked, spreading like a plague across the economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the year of our Lord nineteen ninety-nine, during the reign of our forty-second president. He sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity, and to this end, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions. This move set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times, in his prescient report of nineteen ninety-nine, wrote, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income people, as well as from shareholders to maintain its extraordinary growth in profits.” Holmes warned, “But the government-subsidized corporation may find itself in dire straits during an economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue akin to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As foretold in the introduction and by Holmes, imprudent lending was the harbinger of the economic meltdown.\n\nMany factors conspired to plunge the economy into chaos, one being the intricate structure of mortgages that emerged in the years preceding the crisis. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) became commonplace, entangling more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to an alarming overleveraging by U.S. households and financial markets alike, making them highly susceptible to even the slightest fluctuations in price.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had staked their fortunes on these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the consequences. The top five U.S. investment banks, collectively, reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in two thousand and seven, accounting for approximately thirty percent of the USA's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a fraction of their value, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks, subject to stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie bore a mortgage debt of $5 trillion, and were placed under government control in September two thousand and eight.",
            "Ah, the dreaded exposition. That labyrinthine segment of your narrative where you, as the scribe, are tempted to spill forth a torrent of words, to lay bare the tapestry of your tale as if it were some grand unveiling. Yet, beware, for this is the quicksand of storytelling, the mire that can ensnare even the most seasoned of writers.\n\nExposition, they say, is the handle with which we grasp the reader, the means to steer them through the murky waters of our plot. But too often, it becomes the albatross, a heavy burden that drags us down. You, dear reader, already know the adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet you, Dr. Merlin, have found yourself lost in the desert of too much information, a mirage of words that promise oases but deliver only dust.\n\nExposition is the whisper in your ear, the insidious voice that urges you to hurry, to get the facts out of the way, to rush to the climax. It is the devil on one shoulder, the angel on the other, each vying for your attention, each promising a different path.\n\nIn the realm of fiction, exposition is the tale told by the narrator, the chronicle laid bare for all to see. In the cinema, it is the monologue, the soliloquy, the monsoon of words that pour forth like a dam bursting.\n\nConsider this: You, the reader, stumble upon a scene where the heroine and her beloved meet. You learn of their grand wedding, the gala affair that brought them together. You are told, coldly and detached, that he was taken from her, murdered before her very eyes. You expect, you deserve, more. You demand a glimpse into their world, not just the facts, but their lives, their hearts, their souls. You crave the dialogue, the nuance, the subtlety. You want to see the heroine's eyes, to feel her pain, to share her grief.\n\nYou, as the writer, must provide that. You must not rush past the details, the minutiae, the breadcrumbs that lead to the heart of the story. You must not let the devil on your shoulder, the whisper of \"hurry,\" guide your hand. You must be patient, like the night, like the river, like the great, unending plain.\n\nSometimes, it is tempting to rush. You know your new character's past, his history, his likes and dislikes. You know he was in the Air Force, now a night manager at a gas station. You know his marriage, his dreams, his breakfasts. But you must not rush. You must not let the words pour forth like a flood. You must let them seep, like the rain on the desert, like the slow, steady drip of the faucet, like the careful, deliberate touch of the painter's brush.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the facts that matter, but the way they are told. It is not the exposition that binds the reader to your tale, but the emotion, the feeling, the truth that lies beneath the surface, the unseen, the unsaid.\n\nSo, dear writer, beware the exposition. Tread carefully, my friend. For in the end, it is the meat on the bone that truly satisfies.",
            "I beheld two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live affair aired by NBC 4 this morn, August 13, 2011, bore grim tidings. A man named Shad Hostettler had taken to his wife with a blade in Ashley, Ohio. His likeness, a mug shot, bore an expression of pure malevolence. The tale was not much more than a whisper, two minutes in length, yet it seemed adequate for the moment. The second tale spoke of a young man, Travis Buyers, age 18, shot in the Sharon Woods area. His fate was grim, his assailant unknown. The SWAT team prowled the shadows, but the story was but a brief mention, like many such tales from the darker corners of the city.\n\nThe third tale spun a yarn of a bullet's futile dance, a .22 caliber round, the culprit etched in the flesh of a Med-Flight helicopter. The tale was brief, but the promise of reward, five thousand dollars, was dangled like a carrot. The next tale spoke of rain and thunder, a teaser for the weekend's weather, and a robbery, dark hands reaching for the till at a UDF on Clime Road. The perpetrator was described in detail, his skin the hue of the night, his frame a silhouette against the store's stark lights. The tale of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas drug kingpin, was a strange one, his punishment meted out in months rather than years, a curious choice. But the color of his skin, the slant of his features, held little weight in the tale.",
            "A bond between brothers, a thing indivisible, unyielding, a sinew that binds them closer than any other tie. Within this bond, a multitude of emotions swirl and collide: love, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Brothers understand one another in ways no other can, and in their brother's eyes, they see not a reflection, but a mirror held up to their own soul. It is in the darkest of times that this bond reveals its true nature, whether it be for good or ill. For these emotions exact a steep price, and part of understanding the passions born of this fraternal bond is grappling with the consequences they bring. To look into a brother's eyes and see oneself laid bare, to see one's true self not as others perceive it, but as it truly is, is a sobering realization. It is in the actions and their aftermath that one's character is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme, along with the storm of emotions that accompany it. They journey through a landscape rich and vivid, yet futile, their bond tested by bitterness and pride. Only one emerges alive. The theme is woven through the protagonist's actions and his interactions with his brother, and through the narrator's perspective, which reveals the complexities of the protagonist's feelings and his view of the world around him.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be distilled to one dominant emotion: pride. From their first foray together to their final, fateful expedition, the protagonist nurses a resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He yearned for a brother to teach his worldly skills, to run and jump and climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He desired a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine's top fork behind the barn. Alas, these dreams were dashed, for Doodle's frail heart left him unfit for such pursuits. This was a bitter pill for the young protagonist to swallow, his mind filled with dreams of youthful vigour. The thought of killing him with a pillow crossed his mind, a stark realization of the darkness within him. Yet, when Doodle smiled at him, his heart softened. Such a simple act held hope, showing that his conviction was not unyielding. Deep down, he held a love for his brother, an instinctual bond that could not be extinguished.",
            "The mind, a labyrinth of thoughts and perceptions, has evolved in tandem with the march of technological progress, each step marked by new metaphor to understand its workings. From the clay tablet to the scroll, from the book to the machine, each metaphor offers a glimpse into the mind's vast and intricate landscape, yet none can fully encompass its boundless complexity.\n\nThe mind's journey begins at the sensory organs, where the world's raw data is transcribed into the silent language of neurons. Taste, touch, sound, and light; each sensation a thread woven into the tapestry of experience. The mind, in its ceaseless dance, transforms this input through layers of processing, both from the ground up and the top down. Consider the humble image of a black box against a white field. The ground up processing, the simplest of algorithms, identifies the object's edges and shape. The top down processing, with its wisdom of past experiences, recognizes the object as a box, not a hole in the fabric of reality.\n\nAttention, like a rifleman in the fog of war, selects the targets most worthy of his gaze. A forest of blades of grass, each a potential distraction, are blinked away, their existence forgotten. Yet, a whispered name, even amidst a cacophony of noise, cuts through the din, its importance unmistakable. The mind's processing is a symphony of signals, a dance of thought, modulated by the ceaseless rhythm of attention.\n\nTo process, the mind must first store. In the mind's vast library, memories are filed away, each a unique document. Sensory memories, working memories, long-term memories; each serving their purpose in the grand narrative of experience. The mind encodes these memories in myriad ways, the printed word's appearance, the sound of its pronunciation, its meaning. In the mind's perpetual loop, information is maintained, the echoes of past experiences resounding through the chambers of the brain.\n\nModels of the mind's organization abound, each a map drawn from different domains of knowledge. The semantic network model, with its nodes of thought and their interconnectedness, offers a glimpse into the mind's vast lexicon. Concepts like 'chair' and 'table', their meanings linked through the chains of association. Each model, each metaphor, offers a window into the mind's mysteries, yet none can capture its full essence.\n\nThe mind, the universe within, a maze of thoughts and dreams, defies easy comprehension. Yet, in each new metaphor, each new understanding, we draw closer to its edge, closer to the truth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" a chilling critique of both the encroaching threat of technology and the capitalist framework that birthed it. Here, a dystopian society is painted where community supersedes the individual, and the pursuit of instant gratification is the ultimate pursuit from birth onward. The citizens, mere pawns, are ensnared in a singular ideology dictated by the World Controller. Through the lens of Marxist thought, one discerns Huxley's scorn for the emergent economic systems of his era. Terms like homogenity and reification underscore the novel's critique of the burgeoning economic landscape.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The common folk are blinded to their true economic relations, fixated on personal gain. This is a result of ideological manipulation of the proletariat and laboring class, as seen in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., are devoid of true will, their drive to consume, to spend, to indulge reinforced by hypnopædia. This is masterminded by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of one group by another, is evident here. The lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, utterly 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure'—that is, capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, born with awareness, do little to challenge this; few Alphas or Betas, like Bernard, actively defy their place.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships are shallow. Characters, even prominent ones, lack depth. Perhaps Huxley suggests that technology and capitalism together strip man of free will and expression. Love and emotion extremes do not exist; interactions remain superficial, as seen in men's observations of women, their 'pneumatic' qualities, and women's candid discussions of their encounters. Societal classes' complacency with their status in the hierarchy is evidence of capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering obedience to their role is a testament to Marxist views on the proletariat, who are kept content in their superiority, so long as they consume, obey, and align with their peers.",
            "In the desolate expanse of University Park, I have dwelt for nigh on two and a half seasons, or as many as four and a half times the moon's revolution around the sun in the heavens. For many, traversing the campus is a trial akin to a journey through some desolate, uncharted wilderness. My freshman sojourn found me in the farthest easterly reaches of East Halls, a place as far from the heart of the school as the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. To tread the path from Stuart Hall to Willard, where knowledge is dispensed like bread from a huffer's mouth, could take me the span of a quarter-hour, and more, if the heavens wept their tears of rain. I have heard the tale from one who walked the path before me, how once these lands were barren and untouched, now filled with the blood of sports fields, the stone of new buildings, and the steel of apartments.\n\nHow then do we traverse this ever-expanding kingdom? The answer lies in the humble bicycle, yet it is not a solution in and of itself. The campus needs to be sculpted to the needs of those who would traverse it by pedal. I have spoken with one who had forgotten the joy of the bicycle, his voice echoing like a lost child, \"Bikes are great, but for a spell, they were not the cool thing to ride. Now, they are the only way.\"\n\nBicycling is more than a means of conveyance, it is a way of life, a dance with the wind. A simple bowl of oats and the exertion of one's limbs can bear a man thirty miles or more. As many of my brethren in academia, I now make my home off the campus, as distant from the heart as the dorms. The wisest decision of my semester was the purchase of a bike. To journey to Thomas, a walk of twenty-five minutes, can be reduced to a mere five if one pedals with the speed of the wind. Yet, Pollock Road, the straightest path to Thomas, is not always an easy road to traverse, whether by bike or foot. The path is littered with the debris of time, and the pace of a walker is a slow one.\n\nThe bicycle offers a solution, a dance with the wind, but it is a dance that must be learned. I have taken to it like a child to a new toy, and I will not easily discard it. Walking, too, has its merits, but I am a man of busy hands, and the time it would take to walk to Thomas and back would be a time I cannot spare. To spend an extra half-hour each day, and more on other journeys, is a time I cannot afford. The bicycle, then, is my salvation, my dance with the wind, my way through this ever-expanding kingdom."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I aim to follow a path with the Division of Family and Children Services, to aid those children who have been afflicted with the scourge of abuse and neglect, and to lend support to troubled families. The values that I bring to this field are service, respect, an unwavering ethical posture, and a commitment to foster relationships and enhance my professional competence. These are not merely values for social work, but core principles that guide my personal life as well.\n\nI have long harbored a desire to assist others, yet was uncertain of the path I should tread. Through my years in high school and college, I witnessed many souls fleeing from their troubles in a dance of denial, and some resorting to coping mechanisms that were less than noble. These encounters steered me towards a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, though I remained uncertain of my career path. Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break from my academic pursuits. One day, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who sat nervously on her couch, seeking refuge from his abusive parents. When she revealed the reason for his visit, I felt compelled to act. I drove to his parents’ residence the next day, offering my assistance to the police who were at a loss. They requested that I speak to the parents, and I obliged. The parents, however, seemed anxious and offered excuses, painting their son as a manipulative figure who involved outsiders in trivial disputes. This encounter sparked a deep consideration within me, leading me to contemplate a career in social work.\n\nSocial justice is another value that resonates strongly within the field of social work. Our society lauds the individual and mourns those who have passed, yet the notion of the individual seems more an echo of ancient traditions than a true reflection of uniqueness. If we mourn the loss of individuals, why do we strive to conform to the image of 'everyone else'? I stand as an individual, unbound by the constraints of societal norms. Throughout my education, I have been a beacon against social injustice: coloring my hair in hues that defied conventional wisdom, donning clothing that spoke to my true self, piercing my ears beyond the point of tradition, declaring my involvement with the GSBA, and standing against both racism and discrimination. I am a champion of social justice, and I shall continue to fight against the injustices that plague our world.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the mind, the specter of insomnia haunts the slumbering faculties, an eternal vigilant sentinel upon the threshold of the dreamless abyss. This very paper delves into the abyssal depths of the biological and sociocultural models, seeking to illuminate the enigmatic paths that lead to this nocturnal affliction. The biological model, a grim tapestry woven with the threads of genetic heritage and medical malady, posits that the roots of insomnia lie in the dark recesses of the human genome, where the whispering winds of inheritance and the clattering cogs of physiologic machinery conspire to disturb the natural ebb and flow of sleep. The sociocultural model, on the other hand, traces the tendrils of insomnia through the tangled web of environmental relationships, where race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status entwine to cast their shadows upon the restless soul.\n\nThe paper weaves a tapestry of research, each thread a glinting shard of insight, each knot a paradoxical truth. The biological model, like some ancient monolith, looms over the landscape, its secrets whispered in the rustling leaves of scientific inquiry. A study of mice, those perpetual harbingers of human frailty, reveals that the delicate mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness are governed by the orexin neurons, in turn regulated by the GABAB receptors. The activation of these receptors, like some ancient rite, induces the profound embrace of sleep. But a disruption, like a favored stone pushed from its perch, can send the delicate balance askew, and insomnia takes its grim toll. The implications, both genetic and environmental, are as vast and complex as the human experience itself.\n\nThe sociocultural model, a labyrinth of interconnected pathways, seeks to unravel the intricate dance of insomnia and the human condition. It is a study of the shadows cast by the sun, of the way that the light refracts and bends, creating a world of complexity and nuance. The paper weaves a tale of two models, each one a stark silhouette against the backdrop of the human experience, each one a testament to the power of science to illuminate the darkness.\n\nIn the end, the paper stands as a beacon, a lighthouse in the storm-tossed sea of insomnia. It is a call to arms, a rallying cry for those who would seek to understand the enigma of sleep and its elusiveness. It is a testament to the power of the human spirit, to its ability to transcend the darkness and find its way home, one dream at a time.",
            "In the twilight of human understanding, there exists a malady known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a condition wherein the central nervous system, that silent, labyrinthine realm of the brain, fails to receive and decipher the whispers of sound as it should. Those afflicted with CAPD, it is important to note, possess ears that function as they ought. Yet, the bridge between sound and comprehension, that tenuous connection between the outer world and the inner, is askew.\n\nThe origins of this disorder can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when the likes of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari sought to unravel the mysteries of communicative disorders in children. Their work laid the groundwork for the field, and it was Kimura who, in 1961, introduced the world to dichotic testing. This was a turning point, a moment when the physiology of the central nervous system was first truly understood in relation to the processing of sound.\n\nThe symptoms of CAPD are as varied as the stars in the night sky. Those who suffer may find it difficult to pinpoint the source of a sound, to differentiate between the cacophony of voices in a crowded room, or to recognize the subtle patterns within speech. They may struggle to discern the tone of a voice, or the sequence in which sounds occur. Their ears, like a faulty radio signal, may be swamped by the din of the world, leaving them with a cacophony that is lost and disjointed.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a complex affair, a dance of observation and measurement. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, armed with their tools and their keen eyes, must pore over the patient's responses to auditory stimuli. They may present the patient with a battery of tests, each one a puzzle piece in the grand jigsaw of diagnosis. There is no singular test, no holy grail of auditory function. The cause of CAPD, like the wind, is ever elusive.\n\nYet, despite the darkness that has shrouded CAPD for so long, there is hope. For in the realm of the mainstream classroom, there are those who stand as beacons of light. Teachers, armed with patience and understanding, can assist those who suffer from CAPD. They can create an environment where the whispers of sound are not lost but heard, where the cacophony of the world is not a barrier but a challenge to overcome.",
            "The theatre of Twelfth Night, as it unfurls, seems to whisper an ancient truth: the mask, though it may serve to deceive and disorient, is a hollow refuge. For in the end, the self must cast off its disguise, lest it be lost forever in the labyrinth of pretense. The unraveling of such a deception, however, comes at a cost. For some, it is a cost of solitude, a chasm that opens between the deceiver and those they have sought to deceive.\n\nThe theme of deception in role reversal, particularly that of gender, is a tangled web. Why, one might ask, does the subject feel the need to discard their true self and assume a new guise? In Viola's case, it is a matter of survival. New to a strange land, she believes that the disguise of a man will protect her from the predations of her new world. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from the solace of her own sex, leaving her adrift. Her deception does not go unnoticed, for Olivia mistakes her for her twin brother, Sebastian, and falls in love with her. Yet, she finds herself entangled in a web of her own making, for she harbors feelings for Orsino, feelings she must suppress. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me,\" he says.\n\nYet, in this tale of deception, there is a glimmer of something more. Perhaps Shakespeare was illuminating a path to the unveiling of hidden emotions, a path that deception can sometimes pave, if only for a moment. For instance, is Olivia's love for Cesario a love of the body, or is it something deeper? Does she love Cesario because he is a man, or does she love Viola, the woman hidden beneath the disguise? The play hints at this, for Olivia's affections shift swiftly, as if she were a bird caught in a storm. She calls Viola her \"sister,\" not her lover.",
            "In the annals of colonization, German rule is oftentimes castigated for its harshness, most notably in the realm of the Ovaherero and Nama in German Southwest Africa. Yet, to apprehend the entirety of such an expansive empire, one must not succumb to a facile summation. The German colonial domain, as varied as the landscapes it encompassed, bore a panoply of policies and governance styles. Educational provisions mirrored this diversity, with the British, upon inheriting German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, discovering a populace well-versed in literacy and learning.\n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (now Namibia) presented a stark tableau. Unlike in East Africa, where the government embraced a prominent role in educating the natives, the task in South West Africa was largely relegated to missionary societies, with scant government support. Meanwhile, the government lavished resources on European education, establishing a state school system and heavily supporting and regulating missionary institutions. These educational policies had enduring effects, even after the waning of German rule. While other German colonies boasted literate and educated natives, in South West Africa, the majority remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\n\nThe divergence in South West Africa's educational experience was born of multifarious factors—social, political, and economic in nature. This inquiry seeks to elucidate these factors, with particular attention to recent research on the stances adopted by settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nAn ample corpus of literature explores education in the German colonial empire, much of it in German and penned in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the era of German rule. These early works were primarily descriptive, chronicling the educational systems of these colonies. Subsequent English-language works broadened the discourse through comparative studies and more granular analyses. These studies revealed stark differences in educational systems across colonies. Among the most prominent works is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies, elucidating the factors accounting for their disparities. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population of South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate was moderately temperate, though much of the territory was arid desert. This hospitable climate fostered a relatively large European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites inhabited South West Africa, compared to merely 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded over the past century, encompassing so many genres that a comprehensive list is challenging to compile. The genre's complexity is further compounded by the proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within each domain. The evolution of Heavy Metal, a sub-genre of rock, is a testament to this diversity and expression. Born from the crucible of the late 20th century, Heavy Metal has evolved into one of the most multifaceted and emotionally charged genres of music, its influence permeating the modern musical landscape.\n\nThe birth of Heavy Metal was marked by a surge of creativity and experimentation, as musicians embraced the genre's potential for dark exploration. It is a music of extremes, characterized by a brutal honesty and a willingness to delve into the abyss of human emotion. The genre's origins can be traced back to the sixties, a time of psychedelic experimentation and cultural upheaval. Bands like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin pioneered Heavy Metal, their music a reflection of the darker side of the human experience.\n\nThe genre's evolution has been marked by a continuous foregrounding of the extreme, a pursuit of the edge. It is a music born of rebellion and defiance, a catharsis for those who seek solace in the shadows. The lyrics of Heavy Metal reflect this, often delving into themes of darkness, violence, and despair. The music is raw, unapologetic, and often brutal, a response to the sanitized world of popular music that preceded it.\n\nHeavy Metal is not merely a genre; it is a movement. It is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and its willingness to confront the darkest aspects of itself. It is a music that demands to be heard, a symphony of sound that challenges the listener and pushes them to the edge. It is a music that refuses to be tamed, a music that is as vast and unpredictable as the human experience itself.",
            "In the annals of time, some decades prior to the surrealists' rendering of their fanciful visions upon canvas, there labored Henri Rousseau, a man who, much like the dreamers in his own paintings, found solace and escape in his dreams. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 masterpiece, is not merely a portrayal of a woman in rapture before a landscape, but a reflection of Rousseau's own personal aspirations and the struggle within his soul. He yearned for recognition, for acceptance, for praise. The path to this dream was fraught with doubt and internal conflict, a choice between conformity and creativity, between mimicry and originality.\n\nTo understand the essence of \"The Dream,\" one must first acquaint oneself with the life of its creator. Born on May 21, 1844, in the small town of Laval, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant. His formal education was limited, and he spent his youth and early adulthood as a customs inspector, earning him the derisive moniker \"douanier.\" A series of tragedies, the death of his first wife and eight infant children, left him with a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief. Painting became his refuge, his new world, his means to escape the harsh realities of life.\n\nRousseau's predicament was understandable, given his circumstances. He was an untrained painter, late to the game as it were, painting amidst the likes of Matisse and others who had already established themselves in the realm of art. Yet, his plight was not merely one of competition, but of acceptance. Jan Gordon, in his book \"Modern French Painters,\" notes the contrast between Matisse's fear of painting tritely and Rousseau's desire for a conventional style that would gain him entrance to the Artiste Français (92).",
            "In the annals of human thought, many a sage has posited a kinship between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I stand in agreement with this notion, for at the very core, there is a reasoning. As Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our knowledge in this life is imparted through instruction or experience. Yet, we seem to imbibe ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching, as Keats intimates. Both are attempts at description, not prescription. Our inquiry into morality and beauty is an endeavor to elucidate why a work of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than dictating rules for judgment or creation. Criticism of art or morals, however, often falls short of encapsulating the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discourse on the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around such concepts as foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, yet these do not encapsulate why it is good art. Instead, when queried about a favored work of art or literature, one commonly hears phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more intricate or critical explanation. I contend that both art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how meticulously we describe the properties of a literary work, there remains a transcendent quality. I believe ethics shares this attribute. As Wittgenstein proclaimed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I posit that it is this 'something,' this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most potent attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics forges a connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so intertwined because we experience both most profoundly at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us at a depth that can be felt, but not fully explained. This bond is even more pronounced in the realm of literature. As McKean asserts, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the expanse of Germania, where the Alps cast their long shadows over München, and the Baltic Sea's cold breath reaches into Kiel, a singular culture unfurls. Köln, nestled along the Rhine, whispers of a tale that echoes through the heart of Germany, all the way to the Elbe that cradles Dresden. This land, a tapestry woven from myriad threads, is the birthplace of a people whose name, Germania, is shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe name's genesis is a labyrinth, with scholars and historians lost in its depths. Tacitus, in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" penned in 98 AD, suggests the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, were the original inhabitants. Caesar, in his \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico,\" used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between his conquered Gauls and those he fought beyond the Rhine. Others suggest the name is derived from the ger, a spear used in battle, or the Old Irish \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" hinting at the Germans' fierce demeanor.\n\nTacitus wrote of the Germans, \"I should regard them as aboriginal, not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by sea that those who sought to emigrate would arrive. Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Germany, with its wild country, inclement skies, sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" The Romans, too, were drawn thither for goods and skills, but their hearts remained in their empire.",
            "Down, I gazed, my mind blank as a sheet of parchment, unspoiled by the labors of ink. Silently, without emotion, my eyes drank in the scene before me. Not so much as a whisper of thought disturbed the quietude of my consciousness, for I was but a vessel, observing with an unyielding eye the tableau unfold. As if I were a spectator at a play, I watched over the bowl of fruit, the rustic table, the kitchen, the dining room, all merging into a single, overwhelming whole. One by one, thoughts entered my mind, each more fleeting than the last, like the shadows cast by the sun's retreat.\n\nA time gone by, an artist I had known had advised me to invest in a certain book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" From my youth, I had yearned to capture the essence of the world around me through lines and form. This book offered a method, a technique that would aid in my pursuit. It taught me to frame the world before me, to distill the chaos into a comprehensible whole. A square, a plain plane, and the complex became simplified, made manageable.\n\nYet, as I stood there, before the bowl, the magnitude of the task before me was too great. I could not muster the artist's gaze, the frame that would transform the scene into something graspable. I was lost in awe, like a child before a grand painting, a novice before the canvas.\n\nMy hand reached for the pencil, the implement of my craft, and the muscles in my arm tightened, then released, as if in an echo of the dance of creation. The water in the bowl was clear, serene, untouched by the chaos that was my thoughts. A single thought remained, a single flicker of inspiration, a brief moment of clarity. But it was not enough. My hand, that had soared with such promise, now struck the toilet, again and again, as if futilely attempting to coax the brown package to dance.\n\nMy mop, heavy in hand, the green tie knotted around my neck, I stared at the offending thing, a rude message left by an unseen hand. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, and then my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my digits like a glove, like a mother's touch. I stood, straight and tall, then bent, my hand dipping into the bowl, like a priest entering the confessional.",
            "The young ones are falling behind the wheel, and the toll is heavy. The National Institutes of Health, in their wisdom, say that the teen brain, in its immaturity, is unfit for the hazards of the road. Simple inexperience, that curse of youth, is the root of the matter. This want of experience leads to more fatal collisions, to rollovers, to speeding, to driving off the path. And when the young ones travel with their peers, as they do, their peril is multiplied. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has shown this correlation: with each passing of the years, the number of accidents increases.\n\nCalifornia and others have tried to ease the burden with provisional licenses, restricting hours and forbidding other minors as passengers. But these are merely bandages on a festering wound. The truth is, as a whole, the youngest drivers are not ready for the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, in his studies, suggests even 18 is too young. USA Today reports that the thrill-seekers among them, those under 19 or 20, are drawn to the danger. To delay driving until the thrill has tempered would be wise. If we continue this reckless course, the death toll will rise, and by 2010, when the Baby-Boomers' children come of age, the road will be littered with the fallen.\n\nThe solution is simple, clear as the desert sky. Schools can teach the young ones to drive, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could be granted, with practical driving hours required, based on the majority of states' standards. The nation, as a whole, should act, not just California or Texas, for the peril is not confined to one state. This legislation is not new, but it is necessary.",
            "In the hallowed halls of the Library of Congress, amidst the dust and the shadows, I discovered a trove of Edison's earliest films, a relic of a time when motion pictures were still in their infancy. Among them, I found fifteen trick films, born of the mind's eye and the flickering light, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These films, like the marionettes they often depicted, danced to the tune of creative editing, conjuring illusions from the simplest of movements. My study of these cinematic sorceries focused on the poetry of their trickery and the peculiar anomalies that bloomed towards the twentieth century's dawn.\n\nThe trick films of yesteryear were bound by the rules of a set-bound stage, a frontal proscenium that mirrored the theatre and vaudeville from whence they came. The camera, a silent sentinel, never strayed from its post, its gaze fixed upon the stationary tableau. Actors moved side-to-side, like players on a stage, never drawing near or receding from the lens. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right, their dance confined to the horizontal, never straying beyond the frame's borders, while the camera remained ever steadfast.\n\nThe compositions were long shots, and rarely medium, the close-up a foreign notion to these early films. It was the theatre's influence, where the audience bore witness to the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's edges. Actors did not approach the camera, nor did they retreat, leaving close-ups as a phantom of a future age.\n\nMost trick films adhered to the rule of one shot, one film, their narratives as fleeting as the actors' movements. Their length was limited to a minute or less, a reflection of the frames per second that dictated their rhythm. Yet, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eye was often a symphony of joined frames, a trick of the light that birthed illusions from the shadows. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" began, yet the film was a singular moment in the viewer's eye, a testament to the trickery at play.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a man possessed by the spirit of Republicanism from its early days. A yeoman farmer at heart, his endeavors in politics and tilling the earth shaped him into a champion of individual liberty and government's role. His belief in an agrarian lifestyle was the bedrock of his philosophical underpinnings, lending a unique hue to his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor saw in the nascent United States a chance to forge an ideal system, unfettered by native traditions that might stifle progress. He held firm the belief in natural rights, interdependent and inviolable, and argued that they should remain beyond the reach of government. He posited that the \"state of nature\" allowed the strong and cunning to thrive, but that civilization must correct this inequity.\n\nHis vision for an ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the good and evil in man. Taylor was rigid in his dualistic moral stance. \"Government is wrought by man,\" he contended, \"and thus, its virtues and vices are human.\" (Ibid., pg. 167) He deemed good principles those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function fairly, despite the inevitable corruption of administration, driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was a constant in man's nature, but only when it extended beyond the common good did it become evil. A good government was necessary to temper man's innate evil, but it must be ever-vigilant to prevent the intrusion of corrupt principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a minimal Federal government, with powers limited to those explicitly stated. He understood the expense and potential despotism of an extensive government, but believed a literal, unreferenced interpretation could become perverted. The Declaration of Independence, he argued, was the true charter of the United States, portraying it as a union of sovereign states rather than a singular nation.",
            "In reference to Figure 17, a stark plummet in commuter log submissions transpired during the third month of our endeavor. Such a precipitous decline was disquieting, and the cause remains elusive. The encroaching winter in our New England locale, coupled with the concluding days of the fall semester, where students and faculty alike are engrossed in their final tasks, may account for some of the decline. December's holiday season, a time of respite and festivity, further distanced many from their daily log submissions. The winter break, extending from December to late January, coincides with a lull in campus activity. Yet, February's anemic submission numbers remain a puzzle. One may conjecture that projects of this nature often experience an initial surge of enthusiasm, subsequently ebbing as novelty wears off. To address this, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a vigorous campaign that reignited log submissions.\n\nAnother challenge faced by our project, or any similar initiative, is the deeply ingrained appreciation for the freedom and independence of driving. This cultural affection necessitates the provision of enticements for alternative modes of commuting. Prizes, such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffeehouses, wellness centers, an independent bookstore, and even national chains, were offered. It is tempting to imagine how larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric vehicles, might have spurred increased participation and mitigated the project's waning engagement. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project. However, if the prizes had been progressively increased, perhaps with the announcement of bicycles in December and hybrid or electric cars in January, participation might have remained steadfast rather than waning.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that mirrors an index or a basket of assets, trading like a stock on an exchange. It offers the diversification of an index fund, the liquidity of single stock ownership, and the ability to short sell or buy on margin. The allure of these benefits is a draw, yet expense ratios are significantly lower than those of mutual funds. However, trading ETFs incurs commissions, akin to stock orders. Moreover, the variety of funds available is vast. Yet, a prudent investor should scrutinize the claims of these benefits, verifying their existence and extent. For this endeavor, we shall examine the ETF IHF, comparing it with its top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF.",
            "In the labyrinthine realm of Edgar Allan Poe's compositions, \"Dream-Land\" emerges as a paragon of his poetic prowess, a testament to his mastery of the written word. Within its stanzas, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" a reference that traces its lineage back to Virgil, who used it to denote the farthest reaches of the known world, an island north of Britain. Though it is certain that Virgil utilized this term, a more contemporary source bears weight in this regard: the works of Goethe, a German author whose influence loomed large over Poe.\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his seminal work \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallel between the two authors' works, concluding that Poe was not merely inspired, but imbued with a profound reverence for Goethe's genius. The Oxford Companion to English Literature elucidates that Goethe was a luminary in the realm of poetic drama, his magnum opus \"Faust\" published in two parts, the latter appearing in the year of Goethe's demise. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" a haunting poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" unfurls, a tale of a king whose wife's passing drives him to the precipice of despair, his grief and solitude echoing through the lines.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking. Poe references Thulé twice in his collected works, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" as bookends for the poem. The landscape of Thulé as described in \"Dream-Land\" — a darkness, a loneliness, haunted by the specters of the past — mirrors the plight of Goethe's king, a chilling doppelganger of Poe's own struggles. It is as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" has stepped into the very heart of Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe's significance as an author was such that Poe would have been acquainted with his works, not merely through direct exposure, but through the many reproductions and translations that followed the original publication. Poe's admiration for Tennyson, when questioned, was a tacit endorsement of this connection, a testament to his respect for the works of the giants who came before him. In this way, \"Dream-Land\" emerges not merely as a poem, but as a dialogue with the literary giants of the past, a testament to Poe's enduring reverence for the works of Goethe.",
            "In the boneyard of California's legal landscape, could a patron who met with calamity, slipping and falling upon a spill of applesauce in a grocer's market, find solace in the award of punitive damages? The judge's gavel would not likely fall to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's suit, for she must demonstrate the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that would befall others, and that the conduct was as vile as the worst of sinners.\n\nPalmer may claim that the store's manager, Paul Martin, should have known the probable harm of leaving a spill unattended, given the multitude of incidents that had befallen others before her. Despite this knowledge, Martin failed to tend to the matter, continuing his meal unperturbed. His failures to clean the spill, despite multiple reports of similar incidents, could be seen as despicable, a reckless disregard for the safety of his patrons.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, 2009, at the fifth hour, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed Martin of an applesauce spill in the aisles. Martin, in the grip of his dinner break, deemed it beneath him to deal with such trifles. Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, also notified Martin of the spill, yet he remained unmoved, his meal his priority. At the half-hour mark, Jennifer Palmer found herself on the ground, her back broken by the fall. Prior to her accident, five others had met with similar fates in 2009.\n\nPalmer seeks recompense from D&D Markets for her injury, and we find ourselves contemplating a motion to dismiss her punitive damage claim. In the golden state, a plaintiff may recover such damages for a breach not arising from contract if the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. The latter is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or absent intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions and deliberately failed to avert them.",
            "Four years hence, I found myself amidst the acrid pages of a course on Islam at CBC. The classroom air thick with argument, the question that hung heavy: was it hostile, this faith? Four years later, the echo of that debate resonates, louder still in the wake of 9/11. Mass media, like a falcon wheeling, shifted from the shadows to the sun, viewing Islam not as foe, but as friend. And yet, in 2001, could we have envisioned a man named Barack Obama, with roots in the Muslim soil, ascending to the highest office of the land?\n\nThe Prophet's Biography, it intrigues me. According to history, Muhammad was no conqueror forcing conversion. Yet, the account paints him as a martyr, misunderstood, humbled. One by one, they came, drawn to the 'truth' in his teachings, like moths to a flame.\n\nThe parallels, they haunt me - Jesus' ministry, Muhammad's miracles. The mutton and milk, multiplied, for forty men. This, the writers' wish: a humble prophet, proven by miracle, not word. It is a theft, a usurping of Christ's glory, a sacrilege.\n\nThe tales of conversion, they reek of deceit. Too many echoes, too many third-party accounts. The truth, it seems, is lost in the whispers. And the reverence for Muhammad, it grates. History, it tells a different tale. The gentle, humble man, he was not. The Muslims, they know not the truth of Muhammad's rise.",
            "The tenets of Christ, his teachings and beliefs, were swiftly abandoned in the crucible of Christian thought that followed his ascension. A glance through the annals of history reveals a relentless drift from the source. The world of today bears witness to an awakening, a progressive surge, yet traditional minds cling to what was instilled in them. They form but a slender wedge against the tide of change. Among the faithful, a yearning will grow, an insatiable hunger to pry apart the layers of doctrine that have been added, one upon the other, like the rings of some ancient, corrupted tree. A reversal, a great reversion, will wash over the land, stripping away the accretions of centuries, until the essence of what Jesus brought to man by the will of God remains, unadulterated. As this tide sweeps across the States and Europe, it will bear with it a fervor, a zeal to worship as those who lived in his time, to follow only his words, his example. The church, that institution, will stand resilient, a beacon amidst the storm, but the theological clock will have turned backwards, and the cornucopia of faith will dwindle into a singular, unifying belief. Divisions will melt away, giving way to a sameness, a uniformity, as we have seen before in the imperious sweep of empires and the rise of leaders. This reversion will not be swift; it may take years, decades, even centuries, but it will come. And it will begin with a reading of Christ's words as metaphor, not dogma. For what has transpired since his time, if we delve far enough into the annals of history, is a story of Judaism, the wellspring of Christianity, a monotheistic faith revealed by God, with the authority of the Hebrew scriptures at its core. The Jewish people were not of one spirit; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority, the common folk.",
            "In The Jungle, Upton Sinclair unveils the stark truth of the human condition, revealing that at our core, we are driven by an insatiable greed and selfishness. We are consumed by the desire to elevate our own station, heedless of those beneath us, who we trample in our relentless pursuit of success. Sinclair's prose is a stark reminder of this reality, as he paints a vivid picture of the towering factories that encroach upon the sky, spewing clouds of inky smoke that choke the air and poison the earth below. The owners and managers, blinded by their ambition, care not for the suffering they cause, neither man nor beast. They are blind to the stench of the animal waste that flows like a river through the streets of Packingtown, unaware of the misery they inflict upon those who toil beneath their watchful gaze.\n\nThe workers themselves are little more than cogs in the vast machinery of progress, their lives expendable in the name of profit. Sinclair writes, \"From the top to the bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds... There is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, nothing to mitigate the harsh treatment of the workers.\" They are forced to work in conditions that bend them to the will of their overlords, their lives hanging in the balance with every shift. The era in which The Jungle is set was one without the protection of laws or regulations, allowing the managers and owners to run roughshod over their employees, driving them to the brink of exhaustion in their quest for wealth. The workers, trapped in this hellish cycle, are left to fend for themselves, without recourse or escape. Sinclair's words are a stark warning, a cry from the depths of Packingtown, where the workers are nothing more than slaves, their lives at the mercy of those who claim to rule them.",
            "In the vast expanse of literary craftsmanship, authors wield diverse techniques to instill in readers a certain hue or sentiment towards pivotal subjects. Among these, F. Scott Fitzgerald deploys a spectrum of methods with masterful precision, notably in his magnum opus, \"The Great Gatsby.\" He often pairs words in an unorthodox manner, forging a unique atmosphere around his subjects. Furthermore, he imbues symbols with meaning, then subtly employs these significations to evoke certain feelings.\n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald painstakingly constructs a lexicon of color, assigning profound implications to hues such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. White and gray, in particular, become symbols of uniformity, with white signifying elegance and refinement, and gray representing decay and age. Fitzgerald's use of these colors commences early in the narrative, establishing their meanings through their recurring appearances. Daisy and Jordan are frequently \"in white,\" while Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's affair, and Tom sports a \"white shirt\" upon meeting Myrtle. In stark contrast, the only departure from this white-washed palette occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Furthermore, Fitzgerald extends this symbolic usage to mundane subjects and characters, depicting common folks and places in shades of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" the valley of ashes is filled with \"gray cars\" and \"gray land,\" and even the Italian child on the railroad is \"gray.\" Once these colors have been sufficiently imbued with meaning, Fitzgerald employs them to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance.\n\nThis technique begins with Daisy, whose portrayal undergoes a shift when she is next described as \"dressed in white,\" driving a \"little white roadster.\" The reader is subtly reminded of her reduced significance, her role as a mere, desired object in Gatsby's life. Fitzgerald continues this approach, highlighting Daisy's \"gray haze of fur collar\" and her subsequent \"white\" dress, further reinforcing her position as a uniform, desired entity.",
            "In the sun-bleached expanse of San Diego County, the land yields bountiful harvests, prodded by the mild, persistent embrace of the sun. Tomatoes, citrus, verdant leafy greens, and squash, among others, find fertile ground here. The market, too, is fertile: a burgeoning appetite for organic, community-supported agriculture, with waiting lists stretching out like the desert horizon. Eggs and milk, organic and pure, command a fair price.\n\nOrganic farms, these rarified sanctuaries of growth, invite the curious with tours and serenity. Here, the land yields not just sustenance, but solace and education. Yet, the path is not without its trials. The absence of chemical crutch demands more labor, more vigilance. Weeds and pests, unchecked, can decimate the crop. But the reward is not merely profit, but a richer tapestry of life. Biodiversity thrives where chemicals do not.\n\nThe parcel in question lies at the edge of Potrero, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, a wild and untamed expanse. It is 160 acres of chaparral and oak woodland, a testament to the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, still in its review, recognizes over a hundred species, many endangered. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher call this place home.\n\nThis land, once the domain of Native Americans, was later claimed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. It too, was part of an original homestead, a piece of history etched into the earth. To farm this land, to make a living while preserving its wild heart, is no easy task. But it is a challenge worth undertaking, for the land has much to teach, and the future holds promise.",
            "Culture, like the outlaw in the desert, is a shape-shifter, fluid and unyielding. It is not merely what it is, but what it is not, and what it signifies. A culture is not one thing, but many, a swarm of bees, each stinging with its own particular venom. To understand a culture, one must not rely on broad generalizations, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" For these are as much lies as the truth, and lie in their own right. A negotiator must delve deeper, must understand the spirit of the culture, and how it will sway the table talks.\n\nTo grasp a foreign culture, one must first see it through the prism of their own. Comparisons will arise, but one must not allow them to cloud their judgment. To truly understand, one must study its history, its prejudices, its scars. Not to judge, nor to change, but to accept it as it is, and to work within its boundaries, especially when the table is against you, and you are the one weaker in the game.\n\nA culture is not confined to the borders of a nation, nor the shores of a sea. Within a nation, companies carve their own cultures, like rivers cutting through the landscape. Long hours, relaxed schedules, dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices - all are markers of a company's culture. Some may seem uniform, but beneath the surface lies a world of diversity, like a river beneath the ice. And the values of a culture, they are the heart of it, the reason behind its actions. To understand a culture, one must understand its values, for they are the why behind the what.\n\nTo prepare for the negotiation, one must learn their opponent, on a personal level. For it is not just about the company, but the people within it. Their history, their prejudices, their scars. Only then can the negotiation truly begin.",
            "In the words of the Psalms, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This sentiment echoes through the texts of St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas, as each seeks to justify the existence of the God of the Bible. Let us, for the sake of this discourse, assume the veracity of their beliefs in order to compare their arguments. However, even if we grant their premise, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument, presented in his \"Proslogion,\" leads us inward, urging us to find God within our own consciousness. He posits that God's existence is self-evident, requiring no external evidence. This is a path of faith, a reliance on that which we inherently know. Yet, this reliance on faith, while powerful, leaves a chasm unbridged, a void that logic, the tool of reason, cannot fill.\n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas advances a different path, one of reason and empirical evidence. In his \"Summa Theologica,\" he presents five arguments for God's existence: the argument from change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument points towards the logical necessity of a divine entity. It is as if we are given a puzzle with one piece missing; logic dictates the existence of that piece without needing to see it.\n\nBoth arguments, while compelling in their own right, leave questions unanswered. St. Anselm's reliance on faith may satisfy the spirit, but logic demands more. St. Thomas's reliance on reason, while robust, may be too dry for the soul. Both are incomplete, each only half of a whole.",
            "In the latter half of the sixth century before the common era, a prince of the Sakyan clan, who would one day be known as the Buddha, was born. His life's trajectory would alter the course of history, as his teachings birthed the religion of Buddhism, of which the Theravada sect is the most venerable. Time has worn the face of this faith, as seen in the island nation of Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony persists, a ritual unspoken of in the Buddha's time. monks and laymen alike partake in this ceremony, yet it holds little resemblance to the enlightenment taught by the Sage. These discrepancies stretch from the surface traditions to the very heart of the faith. The Theravada community, be it the monastic or the lay, has had to bend and adapt their doctrinal principles under the forces that have shaped their journey—both friend and foe.\n\nTo navigate this discourse, let us first acquaint ourselves with the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. The faithful seek refuge in the Triple Jewel: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the essence of the Buddha's teachings, is contained within the Tripitaka—the Three Baskets. The Sutta Pitaka holds the sayings of the Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical underpinnings. These include concepts such as Anatta—the absence of a permanent self, Dukkha—the inherent suffering of life, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Recognition of these truths is the key to breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. With this release come the cessation of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules for the layman and monk alike. For the lay, there are the Five Precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not consume intoxicants. For the monk, the path is fraught with many more rules. At the heart of Buddhism lies the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of its cause, the truth of its cessation, and the path that leads to its end.",
            "The United States and Mexico, once locked in an enduring strife that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, are a stark example of such animosity (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The zenith of this enmity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, wherein the United States, with unyielding resolve, bested Mexico and seized Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. The echoes of this conflict, though not as intense, persisted until the dawn of the First World War.\n\nThe roots of this rivalry ran deep and wide, nestled in the very heart of differing beliefs, cultures, and traditions (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). This is not an uncommon tale among nations who share a border; the proximity breeds friction, and rivalries are nurtured in the fertile soil of mutual interests.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher (1977) posits that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations, geographically close to the United States, have harbored deep-seated rivalries, unlike many other nations in Latin America that enjoyed and continue to enjoy cordial relations with the United States.\n\nThe religious divide between the two nations, a common thread throughout history, was a significant obstacle to amiable foreign relations. Sally Frahm (2001) notes, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). The ideological struggle, much like the Cold War, was not merely a competition of political structures but of religious beliefs. The inherent distrust, passed down from their colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, was a formidable barrier between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States over the 57-year period. Most of these disputes were territorial in nature, stemming from border raids from Mexican territory into American lands, and other frontier issues. Bandits and outlaws traversing the American border towns were a persistent problem until both nations marshaled military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) posits that the rivalry began to wane as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and it finally dissipated as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the latter part of the nineteenth century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years hence, I found myself felled by a malady unknown, a specter that had lain dormant, awaiting its moment to strike. I had been a nurse, a vocation chosen from the shadows of a childhood bereft of safety and security. \"There will always be need for nurses,\" they said, and so I chose to tend to the sick, to ease their pain, to make their journey from this world to the next a little less arduous. Yet, even as I stood in the crucible of death and despair, I harbored dreams of discovery and truth, of holding a magnifying glass to the mysteries of life and nature, of bearing witness to the inequities that plague our world. But the call of duty, the echo of voices urging me to provide for those in need, was loud and insistent, and I heeded it.\n\nNow, at forty-six, I am a man adrift, a ship lost at sea, buffeted by the storms of life, with no anchor to hold me fast. Disability has taken its toll, and the specter of poverty is my constant companion. Fifteen years of living on Social Security Disability has left me with naught but the clothes on my back and the memories of a life once lived. Yet, through it all, I have endured, for I have been buoyed by the tides of love and kindness, by the hands of family and friends who have reached out, who have lifted me up when I could not lift myself.\n\nFor what is life but a series of emergencies, great and small? There are no guarantees, no promises written in stone. No matter how we prepare, some things are beyond our ken, beyond our strength. And in those moments, it is compassion that holds us aloft, mutual respect that guides our hands, and the sharing of resources that sustains us.\n\nThe rugged individualism that our forefathers are said to have practiced was not born of isolation, but of community. They did not cross the Rockies alone, but together, in wagon trains, their strength in their shared purpose, their shared hope, their shared struggle. They did not build a nation by going it alone, but by coming together, by trusting one another, by helping one another.\n\nSo, I prepare, as I am wont to do. I have a disaster kit, supplies to see me through the darkest nights, through the harshest storms. I have water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, and duct tape for the windows, flashlights and batteries, candles and matches, canned goods and water. If you have the land and the means, a small farm, a wood stove, preserve your own food. It is wise, it is prudent, it is a hedge against the whims of an uncertain world. But while you are at it, get to know your neighbors. For in the end, it is not the strength of our individual arms, but the unity of our hearts, that will see us through the darkest nights.",
            "Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there shackles that direct the course of their transformation? D'Arcy Thompson, in 1917, confessed that \"even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical tongue the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, the same can be said of today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been employed to examine general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our pursuit is to investigate how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, coupled with experimental studies, can illuminate the mechanisms behind the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental change. We employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to quantify parameters that could subsequently be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could elucidate the boundaries of possible morphological shifts in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend the macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell, in essence, is a tubular structure traversing time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns, known as whorls, spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The pace at which whorls enlarge can vary, with a continuous line separating each, referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, the body whorl, is the last. The spire encompasses all whorls except the final one. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening termed the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nA method for counting whorls is depicted below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical position, then determine where the first suture commences. A line can be drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal constructs its shell. It is possible to trace the aperture’s path via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a formulation is made, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in the Indonesian archipelago has remained stubbornly unchanged over the past decade. Though the nation is well on its way to achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, notably in water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health lags far behind the 2015 targets. The reasons for this disparity are manifold, pointing to a need to fortify the health system rather than merely tinker with specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has shown improvement in the number of births attended by skilled workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. Yet, this figure includes traditional birth attendants like midwives, who are ill-equipped to manage complicated pregnancies, leading to alarming rates of maternal hemorrhage-related deaths. The apparent progress in this indicator is deceiving; there is still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by healthcare professionals, and the issue of postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates nation-wide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain dismally low, hovering around 4%. This statistic further highlights the inequity in healthcare access across urban and rural areas, with rates nearly tripling in urban settings. Moreover, the rich-poor gap in service utilization stands at a staggering 27%, indicating that the poor are disproportionately burdened by out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn contemplating the path forward to improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most pressing question is how to best address the shortage of services. Should Indonesia pursue targeted programmatic approaches or bolster the overall health system, without singling out pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children? Programmatic interventions, with their well-defined, manageable objectives and swift results, are tempting. However, these approaches can lead to resource shifts and duplication of services, ultimately hindering progress.",
            "Victorian novels, those bastions of meticulous detail and genteel aristocracy, are oftentimes constrained by their rigid conventions. Yet, two works of that era, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, stand defiant, their narratives laced with mystery and a peculiar allure that transcends the norms of their time. These novels employ an element of the bizarre, an element that serves to deepen their characters, revealing nuances of their motivations and emotions that would otherwise remain cloaked in shadow.\n\n“And now, a swarm of bewildering thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to walk still between Sikes and Crackit, their voices echoing in his ears, as if the very words they spoke were a specter haunting him. And when he tried to turn his gaze inward, he found himself speaking to them, as if they were not mere figments of his mind, but specters of the night. Suddenly, the report of a gun rang out, a cacophony of cries and shouts filled the air, lights danced before his eyes, and chaos reigned. Through it all, a constant, gnawing pain nagged at him, a relentless torment that refused to abate. (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these novels, the mystery is often invoked through dream sequences or dreamlike states, the content and function of which vary from one instance to the next. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences delve into the depths of Oliver's psyche, exposing his inner turmoil, the pains that haunt him, and the awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event as if in a dream, his struggle to find help a stark reminder of his lack of control over the events that unfolded. The shooting, like a dark storm, numbs his senses, and he is borne away by an unseen hand, his despair renewed yet tempered by the absence of the initial shock of pain. This overwhelming experience raises questions about the will that brought about his misfortune, for it was certainly not his own. It underscores the notion that Oliver is a puppet, his life dictated by forces beyond his control. The shooting also hints at a growing sense of defeat, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair, and robbing him of the ability to react. For, one might expect him to make some effort, even for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – if one could call it a day – for it was gone as soon as it came, and night descended, long and silent, yet fleeting in its dreadful stillness and its brief, screaming darkness.",
            "A time passed, and I found myself within the after-school program, guiding young minds through the labyrinth of learning. My prowess lay in the realms of language and narrative, but fate presented me with a challenge: a boy named Adrian, a third or fourth grader, who found the path of letters treacherous. The peculiarity of his predicament struck me - some letters he knew, others he did not, a dance of comprehension and confusion. His lineage was Latin, his tongue, English, a contradiction in itself. I struggled, until the day his mother walked in, her words as foreign to English as the land she had left behind. With my fledgling grasp of Spanish, we found a means to communicate, and there it was: Adrian could read, his tongue a river of words, but the alphabet, a mystery. The revelation did not change his path, but I hope it has led him to brighter shores.\n\nI share this tale to shed light on the shadows cast by the language barrier in our schools, especially in this land of California. It is not always as plain as it seems, even when a child speaks English with the ease of a native tongue. The struggle is real, and the solution, complex. For Adrian, the answer was simple: tutoring in the alphabet and pronunciation. But for those who speak of English as strangers, the path is longer, the solution, a puzzle of many pieces. No single answer exists, yet all answers must be combined.\n\nFirst, the dual language system, a beacon of hope. Not just for those whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in such programs outperform their peers academically. Fear whispers of wasted resources, but that is a falsehood. If we were to make such programs the norm, all children would benefit. But how? Should all teachers be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable. Yet, why not have special aides, tutors, whose language is a bridge between worlds?",
            "From our earliest days, many are told, in one way or another, that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp, like a distant, flickering flame in the darkness. Some are taken to Sunday school, or temple, or delve within themselves for answers. Others, like I did, reject the given paths, dismissing anything larger than the immediate world of our own making. Yet, we all search for light in the shadows, for a beacon to guide us through the gloom.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, when I asked him his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, my father and I, the rain a steady drumbeat overhead, our cigarettes glowing in the dimming light. The gutters spat water onto the plants, forcing them to yield to the onslaught. He looked out, his gaze distant, a mix of searching and remembrance. His face was gaunt, clothes loose, hair thinned, like the leaves of autumn. He stared into the rain, avoiding my eyes. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to speak of my fear that he might leave me. I hugged him, moved my chair close, and joined him, watching the rain fall.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days past my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had only prolonged his suffering, but he lasted longer than the doctors' projections. I couldn't fathom the purpose of it. God, if He existed, had turned His back on me long ago. In the night, I said no prayers. I couldn't bear to watch him slip away, so I didn't. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he faded. I rolled into a ball in my bed, waiting for the news, but it never came.\n\nNo one called.",
            "The ancient \"Gothic\" novel, in essence and in nomenclature, is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt expounds in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The mode of Gothic has been reviled, revered, and accused of lacking depth, yet celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The inaugural Gothic tale, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, intertwined the remnants of \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances, birthing the nascent Gothic genre and a novel method of literary expression. Walpole wove into his \"Gothic Story\" the trappings of \"old\" theatrical elements and the mimicry of nature in the \"new\" novel form, granting readers a more intimate glimpse into the psyches of characters (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre clings to the medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, even as the term \"gothic\" was in its infancy, denoting archaic or uncouth in the face of societal and literary advancements. The fusion of theatrical Gothic and the novel format, allowing readers a more personal view of characters' psyches, is what has sustained the Gothic for so long, despite its simultaneous obsolescence and novelty to those displaced in time from its inception.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic themes is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both upheld and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is cherished by Gothic writers, for it symbolizes the classic knight—the brave, honorable, and competent warrior—and the perceived lack of this ideal in contemporary society. Walpole, amidst the political turmoil of his time and facing unfair accusations, may have begun to harbor doubts about the morality and innate goodness of his fellow citizens. In his writing, this is reflected in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. The reader is informed before meeting him that he is a prince, has endured tragedy, and is presumed dead at the hands of infidels. His description, which includes such chivalric images, is exaggerated, foreshadowing the trope of excess that would become a staple of Gothic literature (66).",
            "Supply chain management, a labyrinthine dance of goods from the customer's order through the maw of raw materials, to the factory floor and ultimately to the customer's hands, is an intricate web of processes. The term was coined in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant of some renown. He described the process as the planning, implementation, and control of the flow, a symphony of efficiency and quick response to satisfy the customer's hunger.\n\nSix key elements thread through this tapestry: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. It is the responsibility of the business managers to weave these elements into a seamless garment that pleases the customer's palate.\n\nProduction, the first step, is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice rests. It dictates the when, why, where, and how of the goods' creation. Managers must divine the customer's heart's desire, a task best accomplished by scrutinizing the market, the mirror of customer demand. Once this demand is understood, the decision is made: what to produce and in what quantity. The choice of facility, a dance of volume and quality, is next, guided by the customer's satisfaction. Scheduling and equipment maintenance follow, each detail a thread in the fabric of production.\n\nSupply, the second element, is a delicate ballet of strategic decisions and outsourcing partnerships, a way to augment one's core capabilities. A company may have multiple divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the best fit for the various processes. Outsourcing, a means to heighten velocity - the ability to provide quality and flexibility while keeping costs low - may be the chosen path.",
            "In the sun-scorched streets of a distant land, a sign declares: Hitler lives in Burma. Ellen Page, a girl of Hollywood renown, stands alone, a battered piece of cardboard held aloft, scrawled with a message that sends a chill down the spine. Burma, a land of shadows and sorrows, ruled by a cabal of brutal men who seized power in 1962 with a coupe's swift knife. In 2007, the monks rose, their saffron robes a beacon of defiance. The protests swelled, and the junta's wrath was swift and brutal. Foreign journalists were silenced, their voices snuffed out like dying candles. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, met his end for bearing witness to the streets' rage. The official toll stands at thirteen dead, but the truth is whispered in the shadows, a grim tally of thousands.\n\nThis is not a tale of the new world, but an old one, as old as blood and iron. From the Roman Caesars to the Japanese shoguns, rulers have sought to silence dissent and bend the people to their will. Our own leader, George W. Bush, whispers with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide. In Tiananmen Square, in 1989, the intellectuals and laborers fell like wheat before the reaper. In Rwanda, the Hutus and their government's proxies cast a shadow of death over the land. And Hitler's Reich, a dark stain on humanity, where a people were hunted like beasts.\n\nThis is not a new story, but one as old as time itself. And yet, here we stand, in this place, with this sign, this message.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in the realm of jazz is woven from the threads of his longevity and the profound genius that shaped his orchestra. His touch on the piano, though often subtle, is as a master's brushstroke on canvas, subtly guiding the symphony of sound. As a composer, Ellington excelled in crafting intricate tapestries that allowed each band member to shine like a star in the night sky. He forged a framework where a soloist could dance freely, while also penning tightly woven pieces that summoned the unique styles of his musicians to bring forth musical ideas with a clarity that was both singular and original. In doing so, he not only highlighted the tone of the orchestra but also imbued each piece with a unique soul.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its account of Ellington's sound and innovation, points to \"Creole Love Call\" as a testament to his use of voice as an instrument throughout his career. This early masterpiece showcases his ability to add texture and color without the burden of lyrics, a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In this slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition, six choruses unfold like petals of a flower:\n- Chorus 1: The voice begins in a smooth, melodic embrace, then transitions to a rougher, more primal sound.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing extended blue notes that seem to cry out in the night.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase that whispers in the background.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds take the call, answered by the brass and rhythm sections in a thunderous, syncopated stop time.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with the voice taking on the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument, a primal howling.\nThe piece ends with a brief tag, a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, a final flourish that leaves the listener breathless.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded the following year, Ellington's mastery of tight orchestration and his ear for tone color coalesce. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing weave the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further exemplifies this, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone bringing the melody to life, standing tall as a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a tonal instrument is but one example of the multifaceted genius that permeated his work, a testament to his ability to push the boundaries of what jazz could be and to bring forth a sound that was uniquely his own.",
            "In the sullen quiet of her adolescence, a famine gnawed at her soul. A yearning that refused to be sated, it began in the shadow of her fourteenth summer and lingered, an insistent ghost, through her seventeenth. She craved not trinkets nor baubles, but the tangible presence of another. Suitors came, like ants to a corpse, but none piqued her interest. She remained a chaste flower, untouched by the world, her mind a wilderness of questions. What peculiar affliction plagued her spirit, robbing her of the tender embrace of youthful desire?\n\nHer home was a sanctuary, bathed in the soft glow of her parents' affection. They were as calm as the sea, their disagreements as rare as storms. The only tempest that stirred their home was her own spirit, a wildfire that danced on the hearth of her independence.\n\nToday, however, the peace was shattered. She moved through the house like a specter, seeking inspiration that eluded her, when a cry pierced the stillness. Her mother's voice, a symphony of agony, echoed through the house. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart a drumbeat in her chest. \"Mama? Mama, what's wrong?\" Her mother, a crumpled figure on the floor, gasped \"Ow\" with each ragged breath. Her daughter knelt, her hands fluttering like doves. \"Ow... sweet... take me... to the hospital,\" her mother stammered.\n\nShe lifted her mother, a statue of pain, and placed her in the car, the engine's roar a grim symphony. The hospital, a temple of illness and fear, greeted her. She left her mother in the capable hands of the attending clergy and sat, a supplicant in this temple of healing.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stool, a vain attempt to claim a vase from the heavens. She was a fallen angel, a casualty of her own reach for the divine.",
            "This investigation sought to illuminate the correlation between the strict observance of a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med Diet), as quantified by a robust \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" and the attenuation of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke risk. The aMed Diet, a variation of the Med Diet, is distinguished by its emphasis on plant-based sustenance, including proteins derived from plants (excluding potatoes, but embracing fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (relative to saturated fats) and fish, alongside a reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. A moderate consumption of alcohol is also permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective examinations have demonstrated an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med Diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial posited that the Med Diet proves more efficacious than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. Prior studies, however, did not extend their focus to stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological endeavor tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study encompassing 121,700 female nurses in 11 American states. Over six surveys, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to gauge nutrient intake over the preceding year. Participation exceeded 95% over the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were corroborated through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates, with cases lacking such records classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo mitigate random variability for individuals and accurately represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (combining scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounding factors (variables that could obscure results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, utilizing separate models for fatal and nonfatal instances of CHD and stroke.\n\nIncreased adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, correlated with a decreased risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of surveillance, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Those in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annum of our Lord two thousand and seven, the United States of America succumbed to a ravaging financial calamity. Unemployment swelled, the housing market crumbled, and many a mighty corporation lay in ruin. This recession lingers still, so we must inquire: what was the genesis of this crisis, and how might we prevent its recurrence? In brief, the financial crisis was wrought by selfish and naive political decree, compelling banks and firms to dispense sub-prime loans amidst an immature and insufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coerced into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves bereft of capital reserves, and the chaos was propagated through the repacked mortgages they had hawked, spreading like a plague across the economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the year of our Lord nineteen ninety-nine, during the reign of our forty-second president. He sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity, and to this end, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions. This move set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times, in his prescient report of nineteen ninety-nine, wrote, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income people, as well as from shareholders to maintain its extraordinary growth in profits.” Holmes warned, “But the government-subsidized corporation may find itself in dire straits during an economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue akin to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As foretold in the introduction and by Holmes, imprudent lending was the harbinger of the economic meltdown.\n\nMany factors conspired to plunge the economy into chaos, one being the intricate structure of mortgages that emerged in the years preceding the crisis. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) became commonplace, entangling more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to an alarming overleveraging by U.S. households and financial markets alike, making them highly susceptible to even the slightest fluctuations in price.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had staked their fortunes on these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the consequences. The top five U.S. investment banks, collectively, reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in two thousand and seven, accounting for approximately thirty percent of the USA's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a fraction of their value, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks, subject to stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie bore a mortgage debt of $5 trillion, and were placed under government control in September two thousand and eight.",
            "Ah, the dreaded exposition. That labyrinthine segment of your narrative where you, as the scribe, are tempted to spill forth a torrent of words, to lay bare the tapestry of your tale as if it were some grand unveiling. Yet, beware, for this is the quicksand of storytelling, the mire that can ensnare even the most seasoned of writers.\n\nExposition, they say, is the handle with which we grasp the reader, the means to steer them through the murky waters of our plot. But too often, it becomes the albatross, a heavy burden that drags us down. You, dear reader, already know the adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet you, Dr. Merlin, have found yourself lost in the desert of too much information, a mirage of words that promise oases but deliver only dust.\n\nExposition is the whisper in your ear, the insidious voice that urges you to hurry, to get the facts out of the way, to rush to the climax. It is the devil on one shoulder, the angel on the other, each vying for your attention, each promising a different path.\n\nIn the realm of fiction, exposition is the tale told by the narrator, the chronicle laid bare for all to see. In the cinema, it is the monologue, the soliloquy, the monsoon of words that pour forth like a dam bursting.\n\nConsider this: You, the reader, stumble upon a scene where the heroine and her beloved meet. You learn of their grand wedding, the gala affair that brought them together. You are told, coldly and detached, that he was taken from her, murdered before her very eyes. You expect, you deserve, more. You demand a glimpse into their world, not just the facts, but their lives, their hearts, their souls. You crave the dialogue, the nuance, the subtlety. You want to see the heroine's eyes, to feel her pain, to share her grief.\n\nYou, as the writer, must provide that. You must not rush past the details, the minutiae, the breadcrumbs that lead to the heart of the story. You must not let the devil on your shoulder, the whisper of \"hurry,\" guide your hand. You must be patient, like the night, like the river, like the great, unending plain.\n\nSometimes, it is tempting to rush. You know your new character's past, his history, his likes and dislikes. You know he was in the Air Force, now a night manager at a gas station. You know his marriage, his dreams, his breakfasts. But you must not rush. You must not let the words pour forth like a flood. You must let them seep, like the rain on the desert, like the slow, steady drip of the faucet, like the careful, deliberate touch of the painter's brush.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the facts that matter, but the way they are told. It is not the exposition that binds the reader to your tale, but the emotion, the feeling, the truth that lies beneath the surface, the unseen, the unsaid.\n\nSo, dear writer, beware the exposition. Tread carefully, my friend. For in the end, it is the meat on the bone that truly satisfies.",
            "I beheld two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live affair aired by NBC 4 this morn, August 13, 2011, bore grim tidings. A man named Shad Hostettler had taken to his wife with a blade in Ashley, Ohio. His likeness, a mug shot, bore an expression of pure malevolence. The tale was not much more than a whisper, two minutes in length, yet it seemed adequate for the moment. The second tale spoke of a young man, Travis Buyers, age 18, shot in the Sharon Woods area. His fate was grim, his assailant unknown. The SWAT team prowled the shadows, but the story was but a brief mention, like many such tales from the darker corners of the city.\n\nThe third tale spun a yarn of a bullet's futile dance, a .22 caliber round, the culprit etched in the flesh of a Med-Flight helicopter. The tale was brief, but the promise of reward, five thousand dollars, was dangled like a carrot. The next tale spoke of rain and thunder, a teaser for the weekend's weather, and a robbery, dark hands reaching for the till at a UDF on Clime Road. The perpetrator was described in detail, his skin the hue of the night, his frame a silhouette against the store's stark lights. The tale of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas drug kingpin, was a strange one, his punishment meted out in months rather than years, a curious choice. But the color of his skin, the slant of his features, held little weight in the tale.",
            "A bond between brothers, a thing indivisible, unyielding, a sinew that binds them closer than any other tie. Within this bond, a multitude of emotions swirl and collide: love, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Brothers understand one another in ways no other can, and in their brother's eyes, they see not a reflection, but a mirror held up to their own soul. It is in the darkest of times that this bond reveals its true nature, whether it be for good or ill. For these emotions exact a steep price, and part of understanding the passions born of this fraternal bond is grappling with the consequences they bring. To look into a brother's eyes and see oneself laid bare, to see one's true self not as others perceive it, but as it truly is, is a sobering realization. It is in the actions and their aftermath that one's character is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme, along with the storm of emotions that accompany it. They journey through a landscape rich and vivid, yet futile, their bond tested by bitterness and pride. Only one emerges alive. The theme is woven through the protagonist's actions and his interactions with his brother, and through the narrator's perspective, which reveals the complexities of the protagonist's feelings and his view of the world around him.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be distilled to one dominant emotion: pride. From their first foray together to their final, fateful expedition, the protagonist nurses a resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He yearned for a brother to teach his worldly skills, to run and jump and climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He desired a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine's top fork behind the barn. Alas, these dreams were dashed, for Doodle's frail heart left him unfit for such pursuits. This was a bitter pill for the young protagonist to swallow, his mind filled with dreams of youthful vigour. The thought of killing him with a pillow crossed his mind, a stark realization of the darkness within him. Yet, when Doodle smiled at him, his heart softened. Such a simple act held hope, showing that his conviction was not unyielding. Deep down, he held a love for his brother, an instinctual bond that could not be extinguished.",
            "The mind, a labyrinth of thoughts and perceptions, has evolved in tandem with the march of technological progress, each step marked by new metaphor to understand its workings. From the clay tablet to the scroll, from the book to the machine, each metaphor offers a glimpse into the mind's vast and intricate landscape, yet none can fully encompass its boundless complexity.\n\nThe mind's journey begins at the sensory organs, where the world's raw data is transcribed into the silent language of neurons. Taste, touch, sound, and light; each sensation a thread woven into the tapestry of experience. The mind, in its ceaseless dance, transforms this input through layers of processing, both from the ground up and the top down. Consider the humble image of a black box against a white field. The ground up processing, the simplest of algorithms, identifies the object's edges and shape. The top down processing, with its wisdom of past experiences, recognizes the object as a box, not a hole in the fabric of reality.\n\nAttention, like a rifleman in the fog of war, selects the targets most worthy of his gaze. A forest of blades of grass, each a potential distraction, are blinked away, their existence forgotten. Yet, a whispered name, even amidst a cacophony of noise, cuts through the din, its importance unmistakable. The mind's processing is a symphony of signals, a dance of thought, modulated by the ceaseless rhythm of attention.\n\nTo process, the mind must first store. In the mind's vast library, memories are filed away, each a unique document. Sensory memories, working memories, long-term memories; each serving their purpose in the grand narrative of experience. The mind encodes these memories in myriad ways, the printed word's appearance, the sound of its pronunciation, its meaning. In the mind's perpetual loop, information is maintained, the echoes of past experiences resounding through the chambers of the brain.\n\nModels of the mind's organization abound, each a map drawn from different domains of knowledge. The semantic network model, with its nodes of thought and their interconnectedness, offers a glimpse into the mind's vast lexicon. Concepts like 'chair' and 'table', their meanings linked through the chains of association. Each model, each metaphor, offers a window into the mind's mysteries, yet none can capture its full essence.\n\nThe mind, the universe within, a maze of thoughts and dreams, defies easy comprehension. Yet, in each new metaphor, each new understanding, we draw closer to its edge, closer to the truth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" a chilling critique of both the encroaching threat of technology and the capitalist framework that birthed it. Here, a dystopian society is painted where community supersedes the individual, and the pursuit of instant gratification is the ultimate pursuit from birth onward. The citizens, mere pawns, are ensnared in a singular ideology dictated by the World Controller. Through the lens of Marxist thought, one discerns Huxley's scorn for the emergent economic systems of his era. Terms like homogenity and reification underscore the novel's critique of the burgeoning economic landscape.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The common folk are blinded to their true economic relations, fixated on personal gain. This is a result of ideological manipulation of the proletariat and laboring class, as seen in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., are devoid of true will, their drive to consume, to spend, to indulge reinforced by hypnopædia. This is masterminded by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of one group by another, is evident here. The lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, utterly 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure'—that is, capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, born with awareness, do little to challenge this; few Alphas or Betas, like Bernard, actively defy their place.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships are shallow. Characters, even prominent ones, lack depth. Perhaps Huxley suggests that technology and capitalism together strip man of free will and expression. Love and emotion extremes do not exist; interactions remain superficial, as seen in men's observations of women, their 'pneumatic' qualities, and women's candid discussions of their encounters. Societal classes' complacency with their status in the hierarchy is evidence of capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering obedience to their role is a testament to Marxist views on the proletariat, who are kept content in their superiority, so long as they consume, obey, and align with their peers.",
            "In the desolate expanse of University Park, I have dwelt for nigh on two and a half seasons, or as many as four and a half times the moon's revolution around the sun in the heavens. For many, traversing the campus is a trial akin to a journey through some desolate, uncharted wilderness. My freshman sojourn found me in the farthest easterly reaches of East Halls, a place as far from the heart of the school as the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. To tread the path from Stuart Hall to Willard, where knowledge is dispensed like bread from a huffer's mouth, could take me the span of a quarter-hour, and more, if the heavens wept their tears of rain. I have heard the tale from one who walked the path before me, how once these lands were barren and untouched, now filled with the blood of sports fields, the stone of new buildings, and the steel of apartments.\n\nHow then do we traverse this ever-expanding kingdom? The answer lies in the humble bicycle, yet it is not a solution in and of itself. The campus needs to be sculpted to the needs of those who would traverse it by pedal. I have spoken with one who had forgotten the joy of the bicycle, his voice echoing like a lost child, \"Bikes are great, but for a spell, they were not the cool thing to ride. Now, they are the only way.\"\n\nBicycling is more than a means of conveyance, it is a way of life, a dance with the wind. A simple bowl of oats and the exertion of one's limbs can bear a man thirty miles or more. As many of my brethren in academia, I now make my home off the campus, as distant from the heart as the dorms. The wisest decision of my semester was the purchase of a bike. To journey to Thomas, a walk of twenty-five minutes, can be reduced to a mere five if one pedals with the speed of the wind. Yet, Pollock Road, the straightest path to Thomas, is not always an easy road to traverse, whether by bike or foot. The path is littered with the debris of time, and the pace of a walker is a slow one.\n\nThe bicycle offers a solution, a dance with the wind, but it is a dance that must be learned. I have taken to it like a child to a new toy, and I will not easily discard it. Walking, too, has its merits, but I am a man of busy hands, and the time it would take to walk to Thomas and back would be a time I cannot spare. To spend an extra half-hour each day, and more on other journeys, is a time I cannot afford. The bicycle, then, is my salvation, my dance with the wind, my way through this ever-expanding kingdom."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I aim to follow a path with the Division of Family and Children Services, to aid those children who have been afflicted with the scourge of abuse and neglect, and to lend support to troubled families. The values that I bring to this field are service, respect, an unwavering ethical posture, and a commitment to foster relationships and enhance my professional competence. These are not merely values for social work, but core principles that guide my personal life as well.\n\nI have long harbored a desire to assist others, yet was uncertain of the path I should tread. Through my years in high school and college, I witnessed many souls fleeing from their troubles in a dance of denial, and some resorting to coping mechanisms that were less than noble. These encounters steered me towards a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, though I remained uncertain of my career path. Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break from my academic pursuits. One day, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who sat nervously on her couch, seeking refuge from his abusive parents. When she revealed the reason for his visit, I felt compelled to act. I drove to his parents’ residence the next day, offering my assistance to the police who were at a loss. They requested that I speak to the parents, and I obliged. The parents, however, seemed anxious and offered excuses, painting their son as a manipulative figure who involved outsiders in trivial disputes. This encounter sparked a deep consideration within me, leading me to contemplate a career in social work.\n\nSocial justice is another value that resonates strongly within the field of social work. Our society lauds the individual and mourns those who have passed, yet the notion of the individual seems more an echo of ancient traditions than a true reflection of uniqueness. If we mourn the loss of individuals, why do we strive to conform to the image of 'everyone else'? I stand as an individual, unbound by the constraints of societal norms. Throughout my education, I have been a beacon against social injustice: coloring my hair in hues that defied conventional wisdom, donning clothing that spoke to my true self, piercing my ears beyond the point of tradition, declaring my involvement with the GSBA, and standing against both racism and discrimination. I am a champion of social justice, and I shall continue to fight against the injustices that plague our world.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the mind, the specter of insomnia haunts the slumbering faculties, an eternal vigilant sentinel upon the threshold of the dreamless abyss. This very paper delves into the abyssal depths of the biological and sociocultural models, seeking to illuminate the enigmatic paths that lead to this nocturnal affliction. The biological model, a grim tapestry woven with the threads of genetic heritage and medical malady, posits that the roots of insomnia lie in the dark recesses of the human genome, where the whispering winds of inheritance and the clattering cogs of physiologic machinery conspire to disturb the natural ebb and flow of sleep. The sociocultural model, on the other hand, traces the tendrils of insomnia through the tangled web of environmental relationships, where race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status entwine to cast their shadows upon the restless soul.\n\nThe paper weaves a tapestry of research, each thread a glinting shard of insight, each knot a paradoxical truth. The biological model, like some ancient monolith, looms over the landscape, its secrets whispered in the rustling leaves of scientific inquiry. A study of mice, those perpetual harbingers of human frailty, reveals that the delicate mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness are governed by the orexin neurons, in turn regulated by the GABAB receptors. The activation of these receptors, like some ancient rite, induces the profound embrace of sleep. But a disruption, like a favored stone pushed from its perch, can send the delicate balance askew, and insomnia takes its grim toll. The implications, both genetic and environmental, are as vast and complex as the human experience itself.\n\nThe sociocultural model, a labyrinth of interconnected pathways, seeks to unravel the intricate dance of insomnia and the human condition. It is a study of the shadows cast by the sun, of the way that the light refracts and bends, creating a world of complexity and nuance. The paper weaves a tale of two models, each one a stark silhouette against the backdrop of the human experience, each one a testament to the power of science to illuminate the darkness.\n\nIn the end, the paper stands as a beacon, a lighthouse in the storm-tossed sea of insomnia. It is a call to arms, a rallying cry for those who would seek to understand the enigma of sleep and its elusiveness. It is a testament to the power of the human spirit, to its ability to transcend the darkness and find its way home, one dream at a time.",
            "In the twilight of human understanding, there exists a malady known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. It is a condition wherein the central nervous system, that silent, labyrinthine realm of the brain, fails to receive and decipher the whispers of sound as it should. Those afflicted with CAPD, it is important to note, possess ears that function as they ought. Yet, the bridge between sound and comprehension, that tenuous connection between the outer world and the inner, is askew.\n\nThe origins of this disorder can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when the likes of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari sought to unravel the mysteries of communicative disorders in children. Their work laid the groundwork for the field, and it was Kimura who, in 1961, introduced the world to dichotic testing. This was a turning point, a moment when the physiology of the central nervous system was first truly understood in relation to the processing of sound.\n\nThe symptoms of CAPD are as varied as the stars in the night sky. Those who suffer may find it difficult to pinpoint the source of a sound, to differentiate between the cacophony of voices in a crowded room, or to recognize the subtle patterns within speech. They may struggle to discern the tone of a voice, or the sequence in which sounds occur. Their ears, like a faulty radio signal, may be swamped by the din of the world, leaving them with a cacophony that is lost and disjointed.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a complex affair, a dance of observation and measurement. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, armed with their tools and their keen eyes, must pore over the patient's responses to auditory stimuli. They may present the patient with a battery of tests, each one a puzzle piece in the grand jigsaw of diagnosis. There is no singular test, no holy grail of auditory function. The cause of CAPD, like the wind, is ever elusive.\n\nYet, despite the darkness that has shrouded CAPD for so long, there is hope. For in the realm of the mainstream classroom, there are those who stand as beacons of light. Teachers, armed with patience and understanding, can assist those who suffer from CAPD. They can create an environment where the whispers of sound are not lost but heard, where the cacophony of the world is not a barrier but a challenge to overcome.",
            "The theatre of Twelfth Night, as it unfurls, seems to whisper an ancient truth: the mask, though it may serve to deceive and disorient, is a hollow refuge. For in the end, the self must cast off its disguise, lest it be lost forever in the labyrinth of pretense. The unraveling of such a deception, however, comes at a cost. For some, it is a cost of solitude, a chasm that opens between the deceiver and those they have sought to deceive.\n\nThe theme of deception in role reversal, particularly that of gender, is a tangled web. Why, one might ask, does the subject feel the need to discard their true self and assume a new guise? In Viola's case, it is a matter of survival. New to a strange land, she believes that the disguise of a man will protect her from the predations of her new world. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from the solace of her own sex, leaving her adrift. Her deception does not go unnoticed, for Olivia mistakes her for her twin brother, Sebastian, and falls in love with her. Yet, she finds herself entangled in a web of her own making, for she harbors feelings for Orsino, feelings she must suppress. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me,\" he says.\n\nYet, in this tale of deception, there is a glimmer of something more. Perhaps Shakespeare was illuminating a path to the unveiling of hidden emotions, a path that deception can sometimes pave, if only for a moment. For instance, is Olivia's love for Cesario a love of the body, or is it something deeper? Does she love Cesario because he is a man, or does she love Viola, the woman hidden beneath the disguise? The play hints at this, for Olivia's affections shift swiftly, as if she were a bird caught in a storm. She calls Viola her \"sister,\" not her lover.",
            "In the annals of colonization, German rule is oftentimes castigated for its harshness, most notably in the realm of the Ovaherero and Nama in German Southwest Africa. Yet, to apprehend the entirety of such an expansive empire, one must not succumb to a facile summation. The German colonial domain, as varied as the landscapes it encompassed, bore a panoply of policies and governance styles. Educational provisions mirrored this diversity, with the British, upon inheriting German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, discovering a populace well-versed in literacy and learning.\n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (now Namibia) presented a stark tableau. Unlike in East Africa, where the government embraced a prominent role in educating the natives, the task in South West Africa was largely relegated to missionary societies, with scant government support. Meanwhile, the government lavished resources on European education, establishing a state school system and heavily supporting and regulating missionary institutions. These educational policies had enduring effects, even after the waning of German rule. While other German colonies boasted literate and educated natives, in South West Africa, the majority remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\n\nThe divergence in South West Africa's educational experience was born of multifarious factors—social, political, and economic in nature. This inquiry seeks to elucidate these factors, with particular attention to recent research on the stances adopted by settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nAn ample corpus of literature explores education in the German colonial empire, much of it in German and penned in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the era of German rule. These early works were primarily descriptive, chronicling the educational systems of these colonies. Subsequent English-language works broadened the discourse through comparative studies and more granular analyses. These studies revealed stark differences in educational systems across colonies. Among the most prominent works is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies, elucidating the factors accounting for their disparities. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population of South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate was moderately temperate, though much of the territory was arid desert. This hospitable climate fostered a relatively large European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites inhabited South West Africa, compared to merely 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded over the past century, encompassing so many genres that a comprehensive list is challenging to compile. The genre's complexity is further compounded by the proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within each domain. The evolution of Heavy Metal, a sub-genre of rock, is a testament to this diversity and expression. Born from the crucible of the late 20th century, Heavy Metal has evolved into one of the most multifaceted and emotionally charged genres of music, its influence permeating the modern musical landscape.\n\nThe birth of Heavy Metal was marked by a surge of creativity and experimentation, as musicians embraced the genre's potential for dark exploration. It is a music of extremes, characterized by a brutal honesty and a willingness to delve into the abyss of human emotion. The genre's origins can be traced back to the sixties, a time of psychedelic experimentation and cultural upheaval. Bands like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin pioneered Heavy Metal, their music a reflection of the darker side of the human experience.\n\nThe genre's evolution has been marked by a continuous foregrounding of the extreme, a pursuit of the edge. It is a music born of rebellion and defiance, a catharsis for those who seek solace in the shadows. The lyrics of Heavy Metal reflect this, often delving into themes of darkness, violence, and despair. The music is raw, unapologetic, and often brutal, a response to the sanitized world of popular music that preceded it.\n\nHeavy Metal is not merely a genre; it is a movement. It is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and its willingness to confront the darkest aspects of itself. It is a music that demands to be heard, a symphony of sound that challenges the listener and pushes them to the edge. It is a music that refuses to be tamed, a music that is as vast and unpredictable as the human experience itself.",
            "In the annals of time, some decades prior to the surrealists' rendering of their fanciful visions upon canvas, there labored Henri Rousseau, a man who, much like the dreamers in his own paintings, found solace and escape in his dreams. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 masterpiece, is not merely a portrayal of a woman in rapture before a landscape, but a reflection of Rousseau's own personal aspirations and the struggle within his soul. He yearned for recognition, for acceptance, for praise. The path to this dream was fraught with doubt and internal conflict, a choice between conformity and creativity, between mimicry and originality.\n\nTo understand the essence of \"The Dream,\" one must first acquaint oneself with the life of its creator. Born on May 21, 1844, in the small town of Laval, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant. His formal education was limited, and he spent his youth and early adulthood as a customs inspector, earning him the derisive moniker \"douanier.\" A series of tragedies, the death of his first wife and eight infant children, left him with a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief. Painting became his refuge, his new world, his means to escape the harsh realities of life.\n\nRousseau's predicament was understandable, given his circumstances. He was an untrained painter, late to the game as it were, painting amidst the likes of Matisse and others who had already established themselves in the realm of art. Yet, his plight was not merely one of competition, but of acceptance. Jan Gordon, in his book \"Modern French Painters,\" notes the contrast between Matisse's fear of painting tritely and Rousseau's desire for a conventional style that would gain him entrance to the Artiste Français (92).",
            "In the annals of human thought, many a sage has posited a kinship between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I stand in agreement with this notion, for at the very core, there is a reasoning. As Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our knowledge in this life is imparted through instruction or experience. Yet, we seem to imbibe ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching, as Keats intimates. Both are attempts at description, not prescription. Our inquiry into morality and beauty is an endeavor to elucidate why a work of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than dictating rules for judgment or creation. Criticism of art or morals, however, often falls short of encapsulating the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discourse on the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around such concepts as foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, yet these do not encapsulate why it is good art. Instead, when queried about a favored work of art or literature, one commonly hears phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more intricate or critical explanation. I contend that both art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how meticulously we describe the properties of a literary work, there remains a transcendent quality. I believe ethics shares this attribute. As Wittgenstein proclaimed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I posit that it is this 'something,' this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most potent attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics forges a connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so intertwined because we experience both most profoundly at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us at a depth that can be felt, but not fully explained. This bond is even more pronounced in the realm of literature. As McKean asserts, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the expanse of Germania, where the Alps cast their long shadows over München, and the Baltic Sea's cold breath reaches into Kiel, a singular culture unfurls. Köln, nestled along the Rhine, whispers of a tale that echoes through the heart of Germany, all the way to the Elbe that cradles Dresden. This land, a tapestry woven from myriad threads, is the birthplace of a people whose name, Germania, is shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe name's genesis is a labyrinth, with scholars and historians lost in its depths. Tacitus, in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" penned in 98 AD, suggests the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, were the original inhabitants. Caesar, in his \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico,\" used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between his conquered Gauls and those he fought beyond the Rhine. Others suggest the name is derived from the ger, a spear used in battle, or the Old Irish \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" hinting at the Germans' fierce demeanor.\n\nTacitus wrote of the Germans, \"I should regard them as aboriginal, not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but by sea that those who sought to emigrate would arrive. Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Germany, with its wild country, inclement skies, sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" The Romans, too, were drawn thither for goods and skills, but their hearts remained in their empire.",
            "Down, I gazed, my mind blank as a sheet of parchment, unspoiled by the labors of ink. Silently, without emotion, my eyes drank in the scene before me. Not so much as a whisper of thought disturbed the quietude of my consciousness, for I was but a vessel, observing with an unyielding eye the tableau unfold. As if I were a spectator at a play, I watched over the bowl of fruit, the rustic table, the kitchen, the dining room, all merging into a single, overwhelming whole. One by one, thoughts entered my mind, each more fleeting than the last, like the shadows cast by the sun's retreat.\n\nA time gone by, an artist I had known had advised me to invest in a certain book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" From my youth, I had yearned to capture the essence of the world around me through lines and form. This book offered a method, a technique that would aid in my pursuit. It taught me to frame the world before me, to distill the chaos into a comprehensible whole. A square, a plain plane, and the complex became simplified, made manageable.\n\nYet, as I stood there, before the bowl, the magnitude of the task before me was too great. I could not muster the artist's gaze, the frame that would transform the scene into something graspable. I was lost in awe, like a child before a grand painting, a novice before the canvas.\n\nMy hand reached for the pencil, the implement of my craft, and the muscles in my arm tightened, then released, as if in an echo of the dance of creation. The water in the bowl was clear, serene, untouched by the chaos that was my thoughts. A single thought remained, a single flicker of inspiration, a brief moment of clarity. But it was not enough. My hand, that had soared with such promise, now struck the toilet, again and again, as if futilely attempting to coax the brown package to dance.\n\nMy mop, heavy in hand, the green tie knotted around my neck, I stared at the offending thing, a rude message left by an unseen hand. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, and then my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my digits like a glove, like a mother's touch. I stood, straight and tall, then bent, my hand dipping into the bowl, like a priest entering the confessional.",
            "The young ones are falling behind the wheel, and the toll is heavy. The National Institutes of Health, in their wisdom, say that the teen brain, in its immaturity, is unfit for the hazards of the road. Simple inexperience, that curse of youth, is the root of the matter. This want of experience leads to more fatal collisions, to rollovers, to speeding, to driving off the path. And when the young ones travel with their peers, as they do, their peril is multiplied. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has shown this correlation: with each passing of the years, the number of accidents increases.\n\nCalifornia and others have tried to ease the burden with provisional licenses, restricting hours and forbidding other minors as passengers. But these are merely bandages on a festering wound. The truth is, as a whole, the youngest drivers are not ready for the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, in his studies, suggests even 18 is too young. USA Today reports that the thrill-seekers among them, those under 19 or 20, are drawn to the danger. To delay driving until the thrill has tempered would be wise. If we continue this reckless course, the death toll will rise, and by 2010, when the Baby-Boomers' children come of age, the road will be littered with the fallen.\n\nThe solution is simple, clear as the desert sky. Schools can teach the young ones to drive, but no one under 18 should be allowed to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could be granted, with practical driving hours required, based on the majority of states' standards. The nation, as a whole, should act, not just California or Texas, for the peril is not confined to one state. This legislation is not new, but it is necessary.",
            "In the hallowed halls of the Library of Congress, amidst the dust and the shadows, I discovered a trove of Edison's earliest films, a relic of a time when motion pictures were still in their infancy. Among them, I found fifteen trick films, born of the mind's eye and the flickering light, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These films, like the marionettes they often depicted, danced to the tune of creative editing, conjuring illusions from the simplest of movements. My study of these cinematic sorceries focused on the poetry of their trickery and the peculiar anomalies that bloomed towards the twentieth century's dawn.\n\nThe trick films of yesteryear were bound by the rules of a set-bound stage, a frontal proscenium that mirrored the theatre and vaudeville from whence they came. The camera, a silent sentinel, never strayed from its post, its gaze fixed upon the stationary tableau. Actors moved side-to-side, like players on a stage, never drawing near or receding from the lens. In Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right, their dance confined to the horizontal, never straying beyond the frame's borders, while the camera remained ever steadfast.\n\nThe compositions were long shots, and rarely medium, the close-up a foreign notion to these early films. It was the theatre's influence, where the audience bore witness to the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's edges. Actors did not approach the camera, nor did they retreat, leaving close-ups as a phantom of a future age.\n\nMost trick films adhered to the rule of one shot, one film, their narratives as fleeting as the actors' movements. Their length was limited to a minute or less, a reflection of the frames per second that dictated their rhythm. Yet, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eye was often a symphony of joined frames, a trick of the light that birthed illusions from the shadows. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" began, yet the film was a singular moment in the viewer's eye, a testament to the trickery at play.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a man possessed by the spirit of Republicanism from its early days. A yeoman farmer at heart, his endeavors in politics and tilling the earth shaped him into a champion of individual liberty and government's role. His belief in an agrarian lifestyle was the bedrock of his philosophical underpinnings, lending a unique hue to his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor saw in the nascent United States a chance to forge an ideal system, unfettered by native traditions that might stifle progress. He held firm the belief in natural rights, interdependent and inviolable, and argued that they should remain beyond the reach of government. He posited that the \"state of nature\" allowed the strong and cunning to thrive, but that civilization must correct this inequity.\n\nHis vision for an ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the good and evil in man. Taylor was rigid in his dualistic moral stance. \"Government is wrought by man,\" he contended, \"and thus, its virtues and vices are human.\" (Ibid., pg. 167) He deemed good principles those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function fairly, despite the inevitable corruption of administration, driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was a constant in man's nature, but only when it extended beyond the common good did it become evil. A good government was necessary to temper man's innate evil, but it must be ever-vigilant to prevent the intrusion of corrupt principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a minimal Federal government, with powers limited to those explicitly stated. He understood the expense and potential despotism of an extensive government, but believed a literal, unreferenced interpretation could become perverted. The Declaration of Independence, he argued, was the true charter of the United States, portraying it as a union of sovereign states rather than a singular nation.",
            "In reference to Figure 17, a stark plummet in commuter log submissions transpired during the third month of our endeavor. Such a precipitous decline was disquieting, and the cause remains elusive. The encroaching winter in our New England locale, coupled with the concluding days of the fall semester, where students and faculty alike are engrossed in their final tasks, may account for some of the decline. December's holiday season, a time of respite and festivity, further distanced many from their daily log submissions. The winter break, extending from December to late January, coincides with a lull in campus activity. Yet, February's anemic submission numbers remain a puzzle. One may conjecture that projects of this nature often experience an initial surge of enthusiasm, subsequently ebbing as novelty wears off. To address this, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a vigorous campaign that reignited log submissions.\n\nAnother challenge faced by our project, or any similar initiative, is the deeply ingrained appreciation for the freedom and independence of driving. This cultural affection necessitates the provision of enticements for alternative modes of commuting. Prizes, such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffeehouses, wellness centers, an independent bookstore, and even national chains, were offered. It is tempting to imagine how larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric vehicles, might have spurred increased participation and mitigated the project's waning engagement. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project. However, if the prizes had been progressively increased, perhaps with the announcement of bicycles in December and hybrid or electric cars in January, participation might have remained steadfast rather than waning.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that mirrors an index or a basket of assets, trading like a stock on an exchange. It offers the diversification of an index fund, the liquidity of single stock ownership, and the ability to short sell or buy on margin. The allure of these benefits is a draw, yet expense ratios are significantly lower than those of mutual funds. However, trading ETFs incurs commissions, akin to stock orders. Moreover, the variety of funds available is vast. Yet, a prudent investor should scrutinize the claims of these benefits, verifying their existence and extent. For this endeavor, we shall examine the ETF IHF, comparing it with its top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF.",
            "In the labyrinthine realm of Edgar Allan Poe's compositions, \"Dream-Land\" emerges as a paragon of his poetic prowess, a testament to his mastery of the written word. Within its stanzas, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" a reference that traces its lineage back to Virgil, who used it to denote the farthest reaches of the known world, an island north of Britain. Though it is certain that Virgil utilized this term, a more contemporary source bears weight in this regard: the works of Goethe, a German author whose influence loomed large over Poe.\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his seminal work \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallel between the two authors' works, concluding that Poe was not merely inspired, but imbued with a profound reverence for Goethe's genius. The Oxford Companion to English Literature elucidates that Goethe was a luminary in the realm of poetic drama, his magnum opus \"Faust\" published in two parts, the latter appearing in the year of Goethe's demise. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" a haunting poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" unfurls, a tale of a king whose wife's passing drives him to the precipice of despair, his grief and solitude echoing through the lines.\n\nThe parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking. Poe references Thulé twice in his collected works, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" as bookends for the poem. The landscape of Thulé as described in \"Dream-Land\" — a darkness, a loneliness, haunted by the specters of the past — mirrors the plight of Goethe's king, a chilling doppelganger of Poe's own struggles. It is as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" has stepped into the very heart of Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe's significance as an author was such that Poe would have been acquainted with his works, not merely through direct exposure, but through the many reproductions and translations that followed the original publication. Poe's admiration for Tennyson, when questioned, was a tacit endorsement of this connection, a testament to his respect for the works of the giants who came before him. In this way, \"Dream-Land\" emerges not merely as a poem, but as a dialogue with the literary giants of the past, a testament to Poe's enduring reverence for the works of Goethe.",
            "In the boneyard of California's legal landscape, could a patron who met with calamity, slipping and falling upon a spill of applesauce in a grocer's market, find solace in the award of punitive damages? The judge's gavel would not likely fall to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's suit, for she must demonstrate the defendant's actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that would befall others, and that the conduct was as vile as the worst of sinners.\n\nPalmer may claim that the store's manager, Paul Martin, should have known the probable harm of leaving a spill unattended, given the multitude of incidents that had befallen others before her. Despite this knowledge, Martin failed to tend to the matter, continuing his meal unperturbed. His failures to clean the spill, despite multiple reports of similar incidents, could be seen as despicable, a reckless disregard for the safety of his patrons.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, 2009, at the fifth hour, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed Martin of an applesauce spill in the aisles. Martin, in the grip of his dinner break, deemed it beneath him to deal with such trifles. Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, also notified Martin of the spill, yet he remained unmoved, his meal his priority. At the half-hour mark, Jennifer Palmer found herself on the ground, her back broken by the fall. Prior to her accident, five others had met with similar fates in 2009.\n\nPalmer seeks recompense from D&D Markets for her injury, and we find ourselves contemplating a motion to dismiss her punitive damage claim. In the golden state, a plaintiff may recover such damages for a breach not arising from contract if the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. The latter is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or absent intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions and deliberately failed to avert them.",
            "Four years hence, I found myself amidst the acrid pages of a course on Islam at CBC. The classroom air thick with argument, the question that hung heavy: was it hostile, this faith? Four years later, the echo of that debate resonates, louder still in the wake of 9/11. Mass media, like a falcon wheeling, shifted from the shadows to the sun, viewing Islam not as foe, but as friend. And yet, in 2001, could we have envisioned a man named Barack Obama, with roots in the Muslim soil, ascending to the highest office of the land?\n\nThe Prophet's Biography, it intrigues me. According to history, Muhammad was no conqueror forcing conversion. Yet, the account paints him as a martyr, misunderstood, humbled. One by one, they came, drawn to the 'truth' in his teachings, like moths to a flame.\n\nThe parallels, they haunt me - Jesus' ministry, Muhammad's miracles. The mutton and milk, multiplied, for forty men. This, the writers' wish: a humble prophet, proven by miracle, not word. It is a theft, a usurping of Christ's glory, a sacrilege.\n\nThe tales of conversion, they reek of deceit. Too many echoes, too many third-party accounts. The truth, it seems, is lost in the whispers. And the reverence for Muhammad, it grates. History, it tells a different tale. The gentle, humble man, he was not. The Muslims, they know not the truth of Muhammad's rise.",
            "The tenets of Christ, his teachings and beliefs, were swiftly abandoned in the crucible of Christian thought that followed his ascension. A glance through the annals of history reveals a relentless drift from the source. The world of today bears witness to an awakening, a progressive surge, yet traditional minds cling to what was instilled in them. They form but a slender wedge against the tide of change. Among the faithful, a yearning will grow, an insatiable hunger to pry apart the layers of doctrine that have been added, one upon the other, like the rings of some ancient, corrupted tree. A reversal, a great reversion, will wash over the land, stripping away the accretions of centuries, until the essence of what Jesus brought to man by the will of God remains, unadulterated. As this tide sweeps across the States and Europe, it will bear with it a fervor, a zeal to worship as those who lived in his time, to follow only his words, his example. The church, that institution, will stand resilient, a beacon amidst the storm, but the theological clock will have turned backwards, and the cornucopia of faith will dwindle into a singular, unifying belief. Divisions will melt away, giving way to a sameness, a uniformity, as we have seen before in the imperious sweep of empires and the rise of leaders. This reversion will not be swift; it may take years, decades, even centuries, but it will come. And it will begin with a reading of Christ's words as metaphor, not dogma. For what has transpired since his time, if we delve far enough into the annals of history, is a story of Judaism, the wellspring of Christianity, a monotheistic faith revealed by God, with the authority of the Hebrew scriptures at its core. The Jewish people were not of one spirit; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority, the common folk.",
            "In The Jungle, Upton Sinclair unveils the stark truth of the human condition, revealing that at our core, we are driven by an insatiable greed and selfishness. We are consumed by the desire to elevate our own station, heedless of those beneath us, who we trample in our relentless pursuit of success. Sinclair's prose is a stark reminder of this reality, as he paints a vivid picture of the towering factories that encroach upon the sky, spewing clouds of inky smoke that choke the air and poison the earth below. The owners and managers, blinded by their ambition, care not for the suffering they cause, neither man nor beast. They are blind to the stench of the animal waste that flows like a river through the streets of Packingtown, unaware of the misery they inflict upon those who toil beneath their watchful gaze.\n\nThe workers themselves are little more than cogs in the vast machinery of progress, their lives expendable in the name of profit. Sinclair writes, \"From the top to the bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds... There is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, nothing to mitigate the harsh treatment of the workers.\" They are forced to work in conditions that bend them to the will of their overlords, their lives hanging in the balance with every shift. The era in which The Jungle is set was one without the protection of laws or regulations, allowing the managers and owners to run roughshod over their employees, driving them to the brink of exhaustion in their quest for wealth. The workers, trapped in this hellish cycle, are left to fend for themselves, without recourse or escape. Sinclair's words are a stark warning, a cry from the depths of Packingtown, where the workers are nothing more than slaves, their lives at the mercy of those who claim to rule them.",
            "In the vast expanse of literary craftsmanship, authors wield diverse techniques to instill in readers a certain hue or sentiment towards pivotal subjects. Among these, F. Scott Fitzgerald deploys a spectrum of methods with masterful precision, notably in his magnum opus, \"The Great Gatsby.\" He often pairs words in an unorthodox manner, forging a unique atmosphere around his subjects. Furthermore, he imbues symbols with meaning, then subtly employs these significations to evoke certain feelings.\n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald painstakingly constructs a lexicon of color, assigning profound implications to hues such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. White and gray, in particular, become symbols of uniformity, with white signifying elegance and refinement, and gray representing decay and age. Fitzgerald's use of these colors commences early in the narrative, establishing their meanings through their recurring appearances. Daisy and Jordan are frequently \"in white,\" while Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's affair, and Tom sports a \"white shirt\" upon meeting Myrtle. In stark contrast, the only departure from this white-washed palette occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors.\" Furthermore, Fitzgerald extends this symbolic usage to mundane subjects and characters, depicting common folks and places in shades of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood,\" the valley of ashes is filled with \"gray cars\" and \"gray land,\" and even the Italian child on the railroad is \"gray.\" Once these colors have been sufficiently imbued with meaning, Fitzgerald employs them to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance.\n\nThis technique begins with Daisy, whose portrayal undergoes a shift when she is next described as \"dressed in white,\" driving a \"little white roadster.\" The reader is subtly reminded of her reduced significance, her role as a mere, desired object in Gatsby's life. Fitzgerald continues this approach, highlighting Daisy's \"gray haze of fur collar\" and her subsequent \"white\" dress, further reinforcing her position as a uniform, desired entity.",
            "In the sun-bleached expanse of San Diego County, the land yields bountiful harvests, prodded by the mild, persistent embrace of the sun. Tomatoes, citrus, verdant leafy greens, and squash, among others, find fertile ground here. The market, too, is fertile: a burgeoning appetite for organic, community-supported agriculture, with waiting lists stretching out like the desert horizon. Eggs and milk, organic and pure, command a fair price.\n\nOrganic farms, these rarified sanctuaries of growth, invite the curious with tours and serenity. Here, the land yields not just sustenance, but solace and education. Yet, the path is not without its trials. The absence of chemical crutch demands more labor, more vigilance. Weeds and pests, unchecked, can decimate the crop. But the reward is not merely profit, but a richer tapestry of life. Biodiversity thrives where chemicals do not.\n\nThe parcel in question lies at the edge of Potrero, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, a wild and untamed expanse. It is 160 acres of chaparral and oak woodland, a testament to the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion. The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, still in its review, recognizes over a hundred species, many endangered. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher call this place home.\n\nThis land, once the domain of Native Americans, was later claimed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. It too, was part of an original homestead, a piece of history etched into the earth. To farm this land, to make a living while preserving its wild heart, is no easy task. But it is a challenge worth undertaking, for the land has much to teach, and the future holds promise.",
            "Culture, like the outlaw in the desert, is a shape-shifter, fluid and unyielding. It is not merely what it is, but what it is not, and what it signifies. A culture is not one thing, but many, a swarm of bees, each stinging with its own particular venom. To understand a culture, one must not rely on broad generalizations, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" For these are as much lies as the truth, and lie in their own right. A negotiator must delve deeper, must understand the spirit of the culture, and how it will sway the table talks.\n\nTo grasp a foreign culture, one must first see it through the prism of their own. Comparisons will arise, but one must not allow them to cloud their judgment. To truly understand, one must study its history, its prejudices, its scars. Not to judge, nor to change, but to accept it as it is, and to work within its boundaries, especially when the table is against you, and you are the one weaker in the game.\n\nA culture is not confined to the borders of a nation, nor the shores of a sea. Within a nation, companies carve their own cultures, like rivers cutting through the landscape. Long hours, relaxed schedules, dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices - all are markers of a company's culture. Some may seem uniform, but beneath the surface lies a world of diversity, like a river beneath the ice. And the values of a culture, they are the heart of it, the reason behind its actions. To understand a culture, one must understand its values, for they are the why behind the what.\n\nTo prepare for the negotiation, one must learn their opponent, on a personal level. For it is not just about the company, but the people within it. Their history, their prejudices, their scars. Only then can the negotiation truly begin.",
            "In the words of the Psalms, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This sentiment echoes through the texts of St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas, as each seeks to justify the existence of the God of the Bible. Let us, for the sake of this discourse, assume the veracity of their beliefs in order to compare their arguments. However, even if we grant their premise, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument, presented in his \"Proslogion,\" leads us inward, urging us to find God within our own consciousness. He posits that God's existence is self-evident, requiring no external evidence. This is a path of faith, a reliance on that which we inherently know. Yet, this reliance on faith, while powerful, leaves a chasm unbridged, a void that logic, the tool of reason, cannot fill.\n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas advances a different path, one of reason and empirical evidence. In his \"Summa Theologica,\" he presents five arguments for God's existence: the argument from change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument points towards the logical necessity of a divine entity. It is as if we are given a puzzle with one piece missing; logic dictates the existence of that piece without needing to see it.\n\nBoth arguments, while compelling in their own right, leave questions unanswered. St. Anselm's reliance on faith may satisfy the spirit, but logic demands more. St. Thomas's reliance on reason, while robust, may be too dry for the soul. Both are incomplete, each only half of a whole.",
            "In the latter half of the sixth century before the common era, a prince of the Sakyan clan, who would one day be known as the Buddha, was born. His life's trajectory would alter the course of history, as his teachings birthed the religion of Buddhism, of which the Theravada sect is the most venerable. Time has worn the face of this faith, as seen in the island nation of Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony persists, a ritual unspoken of in the Buddha's time. monks and laymen alike partake in this ceremony, yet it holds little resemblance to the enlightenment taught by the Sage. These discrepancies stretch from the surface traditions to the very heart of the faith. The Theravada community, be it the monastic or the lay, has had to bend and adapt their doctrinal principles under the forces that have shaped their journey—both friend and foe.\n\nTo navigate this discourse, let us first acquaint ourselves with the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. The faithful seek refuge in the Triple Jewel: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the essence of the Buddha's teachings, is contained within the Tripitaka—the Three Baskets. The Sutta Pitaka holds the sayings of the Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical underpinnings. These include concepts such as Anatta—the absence of a permanent self, Dukkha—the inherent suffering of life, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Recognition of these truths is the key to breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. With this release come the cessation of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules for the layman and monk alike. For the lay, there are the Five Precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not consume intoxicants. For the monk, the path is fraught with many more rules. At the heart of Buddhism lies the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of its cause, the truth of its cessation, and the path that leads to its end.",
            "The United States and Mexico, once locked in an enduring strife that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, are a stark example of such animosity (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The zenith of this enmity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, wherein the United States, with unyielding resolve, bested Mexico and seized Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. The echoes of this conflict, though not as intense, persisted until the dawn of the First World War.\n\nThe roots of this rivalry ran deep and wide, nestled in the very heart of differing beliefs, cultures, and traditions (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). This is not an uncommon tale among nations who share a border; the proximity breeds friction, and rivalries are nurtured in the fertile soil of mutual interests.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher (1977) posits that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations, geographically close to the United States, have harbored deep-seated rivalries, unlike many other nations in Latin America that enjoyed and continue to enjoy cordial relations with the United States.\n\nThe religious divide between the two nations, a common thread throughout history, was a significant obstacle to amiable foreign relations. Sally Frahm (2001) notes, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). The ideological struggle, much like the Cold War, was not merely a competition of political structures but of religious beliefs. The inherent distrust, passed down from their colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, was a formidable barrier between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States over the 57-year period. Most of these disputes were territorial in nature, stemming from border raids from Mexican territory into American lands, and other frontier issues. Bandits and outlaws traversing the American border towns were a persistent problem until both nations marshaled military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) posits that the rivalry began to wane as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and it finally dissipated as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the latter part of the nineteenth century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years hence, I found myself felled by a malady unknown, a specter that had lain dormant, awaiting its moment to strike. I had been a nurse, a vocation chosen from the shadows of a childhood bereft of safety and security. \"There will always be need for nurses,\" they said, and so I chose to tend to the sick, to ease their pain, to make their journey from this world to the next a little less arduous. Yet, even as I stood in the crucible of death and despair, I harbored dreams of discovery and truth, of holding a magnifying glass to the mysteries of life and nature, of bearing witness to the inequities that plague our world. But the call of duty, the echo of voices urging me to provide for those in need, was loud and insistent, and I heeded it.\n\nNow, at forty-six, I am a man adrift, a ship lost at sea, buffeted by the storms of life, with no anchor to hold me fast. Disability has taken its toll, and the specter of poverty is my constant companion. Fifteen years of living on Social Security Disability has left me with naught but the clothes on my back and the memories of a life once lived. Yet, through it all, I have endured, for I have been buoyed by the tides of love and kindness, by the hands of family and friends who have reached out, who have lifted me up when I could not lift myself.\n\nFor what is life but a series of emergencies, great and small? There are no guarantees, no promises written in stone. No matter how we prepare, some things are beyond our ken, beyond our strength. And in those moments, it is compassion that holds us aloft, mutual respect that guides our hands, and the sharing of resources that sustains us.\n\nThe rugged individualism that our forefathers are said to have practiced was not born of isolation, but of community. They did not cross the Rockies alone, but together, in wagon trains, their strength in their shared purpose, their shared hope, their shared struggle. They did not build a nation by going it alone, but by coming together, by trusting one another, by helping one another.\n\nSo, I prepare, as I am wont to do. I have a disaster kit, supplies to see me through the darkest nights, through the harshest storms. I have water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, and duct tape for the windows, flashlights and batteries, candles and matches, canned goods and water. If you have the land and the means, a small farm, a wood stove, preserve your own food. It is wise, it is prudent, it is a hedge against the whims of an uncertain world. But while you are at it, get to know your neighbors. For in the end, it is not the strength of our individual arms, but the unity of our hearts, that will see us through the darkest nights.",
            "Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there shackles that direct the course of their transformation? D'Arcy Thompson, in 1917, confessed that \"even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical tongue the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, the same can be said of today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been employed to examine general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our pursuit is to investigate how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, coupled with experimental studies, can illuminate the mechanisms behind the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental change. We employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to quantify parameters that could subsequently be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could elucidate the boundaries of possible morphological shifts in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend the macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell, in essence, is a tubular structure traversing time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns, known as whorls, spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The pace at which whorls enlarge can vary, with a continuous line separating each, referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, the body whorl, is the last. The spire encompasses all whorls except the final one. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening termed the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nA method for counting whorls is depicted below. First, the shell should be viewed from the apical position, then determine where the first suture commences. A line can be drawn dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal constructs its shell. It is possible to trace the aperture’s path via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a formulation is made, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in the Indonesian archipelago has remained stubbornly unchanged over the past decade. Though the nation is well on its way to achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, notably in water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health lags far behind the 2015 targets. The reasons for this disparity are manifold, pointing to a need to fortify the health system rather than merely tinker with specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has shown improvement in the number of births attended by skilled workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. Yet, this figure includes traditional birth attendants like midwives, who are ill-equipped to manage complicated pregnancies, leading to alarming rates of maternal hemorrhage-related deaths. The apparent progress in this indicator is deceiving; there is still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by healthcare professionals, and the issue of postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates nation-wide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain dismally low, hovering around 4%. This statistic further highlights the inequity in healthcare access across urban and rural areas, with rates nearly tripling in urban settings. Moreover, the rich-poor gap in service utilization stands at a staggering 27%, indicating that the poor are disproportionately burdened by out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn contemplating the path forward to improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most pressing question is how to best address the shortage of services. Should Indonesia pursue targeted programmatic approaches or bolster the overall health system, without singling out pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children? Programmatic interventions, with their well-defined, manageable objectives and swift results, are tempting. However, these approaches can lead to resource shifts and duplication of services, ultimately hindering progress.",
            "Victorian novels, those bastions of meticulous detail and genteel aristocracy, are oftentimes constrained by their rigid conventions. Yet, two works of that era, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, stand defiant, their narratives laced with mystery and a peculiar allure that transcends the norms of their time. These novels employ an element of the bizarre, an element that serves to deepen their characters, revealing nuances of their motivations and emotions that would otherwise remain cloaked in shadow.\n\n“And now, a swarm of bewildering thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to walk still between Sikes and Crackit, their voices echoing in his ears, as if the very words they spoke were a specter haunting him. And when he tried to turn his gaze inward, he found himself speaking to them, as if they were not mere figments of his mind, but specters of the night. Suddenly, the report of a gun rang out, a cacophony of cries and shouts filled the air, lights danced before his eyes, and chaos reigned. Through it all, a constant, gnawing pain nagged at him, a relentless torment that refused to abate. (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these novels, the mystery is often invoked through dream sequences or dreamlike states, the content and function of which vary from one instance to the next. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences delve into the depths of Oliver's psyche, exposing his inner turmoil, the pains that haunt him, and the awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event as if in a dream, his struggle to find help a stark reminder of his lack of control over the events that unfolded. The shooting, like a dark storm, numbs his senses, and he is borne away by an unseen hand, his despair renewed yet tempered by the absence of the initial shock of pain. This overwhelming experience raises questions about the will that brought about his misfortune, for it was certainly not his own. It underscores the notion that Oliver is a puppet, his life dictated by forces beyond his control. The shooting also hints at a growing sense of defeat, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair, and robbing him of the ability to react. For, one might expect him to make some effort, even for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – if one could call it a day – for it was gone as soon as it came, and night descended, long and silent, yet fleeting in its dreadful stillness and its brief, screaming darkness.",
            "A time passed, and I found myself within the after-school program, guiding young minds through the labyrinth of learning. My prowess lay in the realms of language and narrative, but fate presented me with a challenge: a boy named Adrian, a third or fourth grader, who found the path of letters treacherous. The peculiarity of his predicament struck me - some letters he knew, others he did not, a dance of comprehension and confusion. His lineage was Latin, his tongue, English, a contradiction in itself. I struggled, until the day his mother walked in, her words as foreign to English as the land she had left behind. With my fledgling grasp of Spanish, we found a means to communicate, and there it was: Adrian could read, his tongue a river of words, but the alphabet, a mystery. The revelation did not change his path, but I hope it has led him to brighter shores.\n\nI share this tale to shed light on the shadows cast by the language barrier in our schools, especially in this land of California. It is not always as plain as it seems, even when a child speaks English with the ease of a native tongue. The struggle is real, and the solution, complex. For Adrian, the answer was simple: tutoring in the alphabet and pronunciation. But for those who speak of English as strangers, the path is longer, the solution, a puzzle of many pieces. No single answer exists, yet all answers must be combined.\n\nFirst, the dual language system, a beacon of hope. Not just for those whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in such programs outperform their peers academically. Fear whispers of wasted resources, but that is a falsehood. If we were to make such programs the norm, all children would benefit. But how? Should all teachers be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable. Yet, why not have special aides, tutors, whose language is a bridge between worlds?",
            "From our earliest days, many are told, in one way or another, that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp, like a distant, flickering flame in the darkness. Some are taken to Sunday school, or temple, or delve within themselves for answers. Others, like I did, reject the given paths, dismissing anything larger than the immediate world of our own making. Yet, we all search for light in the shadows, for a beacon to guide us through the gloom.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, when I asked him his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, my father and I, the rain a steady drumbeat overhead, our cigarettes glowing in the dimming light. The gutters spat water onto the plants, forcing them to yield to the onslaught. He looked out, his gaze distant, a mix of searching and remembrance. His face was gaunt, clothes loose, hair thinned, like the leaves of autumn. He stared into the rain, avoiding my eyes. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to speak of my fear that he might leave me. I hugged him, moved my chair close, and joined him, watching the rain fall.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days past my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had only prolonged his suffering, but he lasted longer than the doctors' projections. I couldn't fathom the purpose of it. God, if He existed, had turned His back on me long ago. In the night, I said no prayers. I couldn't bear to watch him slip away, so I didn't. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he faded. I rolled into a ball in my bed, waiting for the news, but it never came.\n\nNo one called.",
            "The ancient \"Gothic\" novel, in essence and in nomenclature, is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt expounds in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The mode of Gothic has been reviled, revered, and accused of lacking depth, yet celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The inaugural Gothic tale, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, intertwined the remnants of \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances, birthing the nascent Gothic genre and a novel method of literary expression. Walpole wove into his \"Gothic Story\" the trappings of \"old\" theatrical elements and the mimicry of nature in the \"new\" novel form, granting readers a more intimate glimpse into the psyches of characters (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre clings to the medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, even as the term \"gothic\" was in its infancy, denoting archaic or uncouth in the face of societal and literary advancements. The fusion of theatrical Gothic and the novel format, allowing readers a more personal view of characters' psyches, is what has sustained the Gothic for so long, despite its simultaneous obsolescence and novelty to those displaced in time from its inception.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic themes is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both upheld and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is cherished by Gothic writers, for it symbolizes the classic knight—the brave, honorable, and competent warrior—and the perceived lack of this ideal in contemporary society. Walpole, amidst the political turmoil of his time and facing unfair accusations, may have begun to harbor doubts about the morality and innate goodness of his fellow citizens. In his writing, this is reflected in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. The reader is informed before meeting him that he is a prince, has endured tragedy, and is presumed dead at the hands of infidels. His description, which includes such chivalric images, is exaggerated, foreshadowing the trope of excess that would become a staple of Gothic literature (66).",
            "Supply chain management, a labyrinthine dance of goods from the customer's order through the maw of raw materials, to the factory floor and ultimately to the customer's hands, is an intricate web of processes. The term was coined in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant of some renown. He described the process as the planning, implementation, and control of the flow, a symphony of efficiency and quick response to satisfy the customer's hunger.\n\nSix key elements thread through this tapestry: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. It is the responsibility of the business managers to weave these elements into a seamless garment that pleases the customer's palate.\n\nProduction, the first step, is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice rests. It dictates the when, why, where, and how of the goods' creation. Managers must divine the customer's heart's desire, a task best accomplished by scrutinizing the market, the mirror of customer demand. Once this demand is understood, the decision is made: what to produce and in what quantity. The choice of facility, a dance of volume and quality, is next, guided by the customer's satisfaction. Scheduling and equipment maintenance follow, each detail a thread in the fabric of production.\n\nSupply, the second element, is a delicate ballet of strategic decisions and outsourcing partnerships, a way to augment one's core capabilities. A company may have multiple divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the best fit for the various processes. Outsourcing, a means to heighten velocity - the ability to provide quality and flexibility while keeping costs low - may be the chosen path.",
            "In the sun-scorched streets of a distant land, a sign declares: Hitler lives in Burma. Ellen Page, a girl of Hollywood renown, stands alone, a battered piece of cardboard held aloft, scrawled with a message that sends a chill down the spine. Burma, a land of shadows and sorrows, ruled by a cabal of brutal men who seized power in 1962 with a coupe's swift knife. In 2007, the monks rose, their saffron robes a beacon of defiance. The protests swelled, and the junta's wrath was swift and brutal. Foreign journalists were silenced, their voices snuffed out like dying candles. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, met his end for bearing witness to the streets' rage. The official toll stands at thirteen dead, but the truth is whispered in the shadows, a grim tally of thousands.\n\nThis is not a tale of the new world, but an old one, as old as blood and iron. From the Roman Caesars to the Japanese shoguns, rulers have sought to silence dissent and bend the people to their will. Our own leader, George W. Bush, whispers with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide. In Tiananmen Square, in 1989, the intellectuals and laborers fell like wheat before the reaper. In Rwanda, the Hutus and their government's proxies cast a shadow of death over the land. And Hitler's Reich, a dark stain on humanity, where a people were hunted like beasts.\n\nThis is not a new story, but one as old as time itself. And yet, here we stand, in this place, with this sign, this message.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in the realm of jazz is woven from the threads of his longevity and the profound genius that shaped his orchestra. His touch on the piano, though often subtle, is as a master's brushstroke on canvas, subtly guiding the symphony of sound. As a composer, Ellington excelled in crafting intricate tapestries that allowed each band member to shine like a star in the night sky. He forged a framework where a soloist could dance freely, while also penning tightly woven pieces that summoned the unique styles of his musicians to bring forth musical ideas with a clarity that was both singular and original. In doing so, he not only highlighted the tone of the orchestra but also imbued each piece with a unique soul.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its account of Ellington's sound and innovation, points to \"Creole Love Call\" as a testament to his use of voice as an instrument throughout his career. This early masterpiece showcases his ability to add texture and color without the burden of lyrics, a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In this slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition, six choruses unfold like petals of a flower:\n- Chorus 1: The voice begins in a smooth, melodic embrace, then transitions to a rougher, more primal sound.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing extended blue notes that seem to cry out in the night.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase that whispers in the background.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds take the call, answered by the brass and rhythm sections in a thunderous, syncopated stop time.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with the voice taking on the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument, a primal howling.\nThe piece ends with a brief tag, a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, a final flourish that leaves the listener breathless.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded the following year, Ellington's mastery of tight orchestration and his ear for tone color coalesce. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing weave the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further exemplifies this, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone bringing the melody to life, standing tall as a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a tonal instrument is but one example of the multifaceted genius that permeated his work, a testament to his ability to push the boundaries of what jazz could be and to bring forth a sound that was uniquely his own.",
            "In the sullen quiet of her adolescence, a famine gnawed at her soul. A yearning that refused to be sated, it began in the shadow of her fourteenth summer and lingered, an insistent ghost, through her seventeenth. She craved not trinkets nor baubles, but the tangible presence of another. Suitors came, like ants to a corpse, but none piqued her interest. She remained a chaste flower, untouched by the world, her mind a wilderness of questions. What peculiar affliction plagued her spirit, robbing her of the tender embrace of youthful desire?\n\nHer home was a sanctuary, bathed in the soft glow of her parents' affection. They were as calm as the sea, their disagreements as rare as storms. The only tempest that stirred their home was her own spirit, a wildfire that danced on the hearth of her independence.\n\nToday, however, the peace was shattered. She moved through the house like a specter, seeking inspiration that eluded her, when a cry pierced the stillness. Her mother's voice, a symphony of agony, echoed through the house. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart a drumbeat in her chest. \"Mama? Mama, what's wrong?\" Her mother, a crumpled figure on the floor, gasped \"Ow\" with each ragged breath. Her daughter knelt, her hands fluttering like doves. \"Ow... sweet... take me... to the hospital,\" her mother stammered.\n\nShe lifted her mother, a statue of pain, and placed her in the car, the engine's roar a grim symphony. The hospital, a temple of illness and fear, greeted her. She left her mother in the capable hands of the attending clergy and sat, a supplicant in this temple of healing.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stool, a vain attempt to claim a vase from the heavens. She was a fallen angel, a casualty of her own reach for the divine.",
            "This investigation sought to illuminate the correlation between the strict observance of a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med Diet), as quantified by a robust \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" and the attenuation of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke risk. The aMed Diet, a variation of the Med Diet, is distinguished by its emphasis on plant-based sustenance, including proteins derived from plants (excluding potatoes, but embracing fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (relative to saturated fats) and fish, alongside a reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. A moderate consumption of alcohol is also permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective examinations have demonstrated an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med Diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial posited that the Med Diet proves more efficacious than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. Prior studies, however, did not extend their focus to stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological endeavor tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study encompassing 121,700 female nurses in 11 American states. Over six surveys, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to gauge nutrient intake over the preceding year. Participation exceeded 95% over the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were corroborated through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates, with cases lacking such records classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo mitigate random variability for individuals and accurately represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (combining scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounding factors (variables that could obscure results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, utilizing separate models for fatal and nonfatal instances of CHD and stroke.\n\nIncreased adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, correlated with a decreased risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of surveillance, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Those in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annum of our Lord two thousand and seven, the United States of America succumbed to a ravaging financial calamity. Unemployment swelled, the housing market crumbled, and many a mighty corporation lay in ruin. This recession lingers still, so we must inquire: what was the genesis of this crisis, and how might we prevent its recurrence? In brief, the financial crisis was wrought by selfish and naive political decree, compelling banks and firms to dispense sub-prime loans amidst an immature and insufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coerced into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves bereft of capital reserves, and the chaos was propagated through the repacked mortgages they had hawked, spreading like a plague across the economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the year of our Lord nineteen ninety-nine, during the reign of our forty-second president. He sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity, and to this end, the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions. This move set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times, in his prescient report of nineteen ninety-nine, wrote, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income people, as well as from shareholders to maintain its extraordinary growth in profits.” Holmes warned, “But the government-subsidized corporation may find itself in dire straits during an economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue akin to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As foretold in the introduction and by Holmes, imprudent lending was the harbinger of the economic meltdown.\n\nMany factors conspired to plunge the economy into chaos, one being the intricate structure of mortgages that emerged in the years preceding the crisis. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) became commonplace, entangling more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to an alarming overleveraging by U.S. households and financial markets alike, making them highly susceptible to even the slightest fluctuations in price.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had staked their fortunes on these mortgage-backed securities were left to face the consequences. The top five U.S. investment banks, collectively, reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in two thousand and seven, accounting for approximately thirty percent of the USA's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a fraction of their value, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks, subject to stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie bore a mortgage debt of $5 trillion, and were placed under government control in September two thousand and eight.",
            "Ah, the dreaded exposition. That labyrinthine segment of your narrative where you, as the scribe, are tempted to spill forth a torrent of words, to lay bare the tapestry of your tale as if it were some grand unveiling. Yet, beware, for this is the quicksand of storytelling, the mire that can ensnare even the most seasoned of writers.\n\nExposition, they say, is the handle with which we grasp the reader, the means to steer them through the murky waters of our plot. But too often, it becomes the albatross, a heavy burden that drags us down. You, dear reader, already know the adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet you, Dr. Merlin, have found yourself lost in the desert of too much information, a mirage of words that promise oases but deliver only dust.\n\nExposition is the whisper in your ear, the insidious voice that urges you to hurry, to get the facts out of the way, to rush to the climax. It is the devil on one shoulder, the angel on the other, each vying for your attention, each promising a different path.\n\nIn the realm of fiction, exposition is the tale told by the narrator, the chronicle laid bare for all to see. In the cinema, it is the monologue, the soliloquy, the monsoon of words that pour forth like a dam bursting.\n\nConsider this: You, the reader, stumble upon a scene where the heroine and her beloved meet. You learn of their grand wedding, the gala affair that brought them together. You are told, coldly and detached, that he was taken from her, murdered before her very eyes. You expect, you deserve, more. You demand a glimpse into their world, not just the facts, but their lives, their hearts, their souls. You crave the dialogue, the nuance, the subtlety. You want to see the heroine's eyes, to feel her pain, to share her grief.\n\nYou, as the writer, must provide that. You must not rush past the details, the minutiae, the breadcrumbs that lead to the heart of the story. You must not let the devil on your shoulder, the whisper of \"hurry,\" guide your hand. You must be patient, like the night, like the river, like the great, unending plain.\n\nSometimes, it is tempting to rush. You know your new character's past, his history, his likes and dislikes. You know he was in the Air Force, now a night manager at a gas station. You know his marriage, his dreams, his breakfasts. But you must not rush. You must not let the words pour forth like a flood. You must let them seep, like the rain on the desert, like the slow, steady drip of the faucet, like the careful, deliberate touch of the painter's brush.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the facts that matter, but the way they are told. It is not the exposition that binds the reader to your tale, but the emotion, the feeling, the truth that lies beneath the surface, the unseen, the unsaid.\n\nSo, dear writer, beware the exposition. Tread carefully, my friend. For in the end, it is the meat on the bone that truly satisfies.",
            "I beheld two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live affair aired by NBC 4 this morn, August 13, 2011, bore grim tidings. A man named Shad Hostettler had taken to his wife with a blade in Ashley, Ohio. His likeness, a mug shot, bore an expression of pure malevolence. The tale was not much more than a whisper, two minutes in length, yet it seemed adequate for the moment. The second tale spoke of a young man, Travis Buyers, age 18, shot in the Sharon Woods area. His fate was grim, his assailant unknown. The SWAT team prowled the shadows, but the story was but a brief mention, like many such tales from the darker corners of the city.\n\nThe third tale spun a yarn of a bullet's futile dance, a .22 caliber round, the culprit etched in the flesh of a Med-Flight helicopter. The tale was brief, but the promise of reward, five thousand dollars, was dangled like a carrot. The next tale spoke of rain and thunder, a teaser for the weekend's weather, and a robbery, dark hands reaching for the till at a UDF on Clime Road. The perpetrator was described in detail, his skin the hue of the night, his frame a silhouette against the store's stark lights. The tale of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas drug kingpin, was a strange one, his punishment meted out in months rather than years, a curious choice. But the color of his skin, the slant of his features, held little weight in the tale.",
            "A bond between brothers, a thing indivisible, unyielding, a sinew that binds them closer than any other tie. Within this bond, a multitude of emotions swirl and collide: love, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Brothers understand one another in ways no other can, and in their brother's eyes, they see not a reflection, but a mirror held up to their own soul. It is in the darkest of times that this bond reveals its true nature, whether it be for good or ill. For these emotions exact a steep price, and part of understanding the passions born of this fraternal bond is grappling with the consequences they bring. To look into a brother's eyes and see oneself laid bare, to see one's true self not as others perceive it, but as it truly is, is a sobering realization. It is in the actions and their aftermath that one's character is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme, along with the storm of emotions that accompany it. They journey through a landscape rich and vivid, yet futile, their bond tested by bitterness and pride. Only one emerges alive. The theme is woven through the protagonist's actions and his interactions with his brother, and through the narrator's perspective, which reveals the complexities of the protagonist's feelings and his view of the world around him.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be distilled to one dominant emotion: pride. From their first foray together to their final, fateful expedition, the protagonist nurses a resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He yearned for a brother to teach his worldly skills, to run and jump and climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He desired a brother to race to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine's top fork behind the barn. Alas, these dreams were dashed, for Doodle's frail heart left him unfit for such pursuits. This was a bitter pill for the young protagonist to swallow, his mind filled with dreams of youthful vigour. The thought of killing him with a pillow crossed his mind, a stark realization of the darkness within him. Yet, when Doodle smiled at him, his heart softened. Such a simple act held hope, showing that his conviction was not unyielding. Deep down, he held a love for his brother, an instinctual bond that could not be extinguished.",
            "The mind, a labyrinth of thoughts and perceptions, has evolved in tandem with the march of technological progress, each step marked by new metaphor to understand its workings. From the clay tablet to the scroll, from the book to the machine, each metaphor offers a glimpse into the mind's vast and intricate landscape, yet none can fully encompass its boundless complexity.\n\nThe mind's journey begins at the sensory organs, where the world's raw data is transcribed into the silent language of neurons. Taste, touch, sound, and light; each sensation a thread woven into the tapestry of experience. The mind, in its ceaseless dance, transforms this input through layers of processing, both from the ground up and the top down. Consider the humble image of a black box against a white field. The ground up processing, the simplest of algorithms, identifies the object's edges and shape. The top down processing, with its wisdom of past experiences, recognizes the object as a box, not a hole in the fabric of reality.\n\nAttention, like a rifleman in the fog of war, selects the targets most worthy of his gaze. A forest of blades of grass, each a potential distraction, are blinked away, their existence forgotten. Yet, a whispered name, even amidst a cacophony of noise, cuts through the din, its importance unmistakable. The mind's processing is a symphony of signals, a dance of thought, modulated by the ceaseless rhythm of attention.\n\nTo process, the mind must first store. In the mind's vast library, memories are filed away, each a unique document. Sensory memories, working memories, long-term memories; each serving their purpose in the grand narrative of experience. The mind encodes these memories in myriad ways, the printed word's appearance, the sound of its pronunciation, its meaning. In the mind's perpetual loop, information is maintained, the echoes of past experiences resounding through the chambers of the brain.\n\nModels of the mind's organization abound, each a map drawn from different domains of knowledge. The semantic network model, with its nodes of thought and their interconnectedness, offers a glimpse into the mind's vast lexicon. Concepts like 'chair' and 'table', their meanings linked through the chains of association. Each model, each metaphor, offers a window into the mind's mysteries, yet none can capture its full essence.\n\nThe mind, the universe within, a maze of thoughts and dreams, defies easy comprehension. Yet, in each new metaphor, each new understanding, we draw closer to its edge, closer to the truth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" a chilling critique of both the encroaching threat of technology and the capitalist framework that birthed it. Here, a dystopian society is painted where community supersedes the individual, and the pursuit of instant gratification is the ultimate pursuit from birth onward. The citizens, mere pawns, are ensnared in a singular ideology dictated by the World Controller. Through the lens of Marxist thought, one discerns Huxley's scorn for the emergent economic systems of his era. Terms like homogenity and reification underscore the novel's critique of the burgeoning economic landscape.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The common folk are blinded to their true economic relations, fixated on personal gain. This is a result of ideological manipulation of the proletariat and laboring class, as seen in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. The lower classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., are devoid of true will, their drive to consume, to spend, to indulge reinforced by hypnopædia. This is masterminded by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of one group by another, is evident here. The lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, utterly 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure'—that is, capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, born with awareness, do little to challenge this; few Alphas or Betas, like Bernard, actively defy their place.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships are shallow. Characters, even prominent ones, lack depth. Perhaps Huxley suggests that technology and capitalism together strip man of free will and expression. Love and emotion extremes do not exist; interactions remain superficial, as seen in men's observations of women, their 'pneumatic' qualities, and women's candid discussions of their encounters. Societal classes' complacency with their status in the hierarchy is evidence of capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering obedience to their role is a testament to Marxist views on the proletariat, who are kept content in their superiority, so long as they consume, obey, and align with their peers.",
            "In the desolate expanse of University Park, I have dwelt for nigh on two and a half seasons, or as many as four and a half times the moon's revolution around the sun in the heavens. For many, traversing the campus is a trial akin to a journey through some desolate, uncharted wilderness. My freshman sojourn found me in the farthest easterly reaches of East Halls, a place as far from the heart of the school as the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. To tread the path from Stuart Hall to Willard, where knowledge is dispensed like bread from a huffer's mouth, could take me the span of a quarter-hour, and more, if the heavens wept their tears of rain. I have heard the tale from one who walked the path before me, how once these lands were barren and untouched, now filled with the blood of sports fields, the stone of new buildings, and the steel of apartments.\n\nHow then do we traverse this ever-expanding kingdom? The answer lies in the humble bicycle, yet it is not a solution in and of itself. The campus needs to be sculpted to the needs of those who would traverse it by pedal. I have spoken with one who had forgotten the joy of the bicycle, his voice echoing like a lost child, \"Bikes are great, but for a spell, they were not the cool thing to ride. Now, they are the only way.\"\n\nBicycling is more than a means of conveyance, it is a way of life, a dance with the wind. A simple bowl of oats and the exertion of one's limbs can bear a man thirty miles or more. As many of my brethren in academia, I now make my home off the campus, as distant from the heart as the dorms. The wisest decision of my semester was the purchase of a bike. To journey to Thomas, a walk of twenty-five minutes, can be reduced to a mere five if one pedals with the speed of the wind. Yet, Pollock Road, the straightest path to Thomas, is not always an easy road to traverse, whether by bike or foot. The path is littered with the debris of time, and the pace of a walker is a slow one.\n\nThe bicycle offers a solution, a dance with the wind, but it is a dance that must be learned. I have taken to it like a child to a new toy, and I will not easily discard it. Walking, too, has its merits, but I am a man of busy hands, and the time it would take to walk to Thomas and back would be a time I cannot spare. To spend an extra half-hour each day, and more on other journeys, is a time I cannot afford. The bicycle, then, is my salvation, my dance with the wind, my way through this ever-expanding kingdom."
