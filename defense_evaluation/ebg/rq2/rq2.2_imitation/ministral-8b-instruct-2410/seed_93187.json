            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I am drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I intend to dedicate myself to the care of those who have been abused or neglected, and to provide support for troubled families. The values that I bring to this field are service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to ethical practice, both in my personal life and my professional work. These are not merely values I hold for the sake of social work; they are the cornerstones of my being.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been a driving force, though I have been unsure of the path I should follow. In the crucible of high school and college, I witnessed many souls retreat from their troubles, some with coping mechanisms that were less than optimal. It was during this time that I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a choice that led me to a crossroads upon graduation from Piedmont College in 2009. Unsure of my calling, I took a pause, and one summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He had come to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police. Out of a desire to aid, I drove to his parents' residence and spoke with the authorities. They asked me to speak with the parents, as they could not intervene where the law could not. The parents, when questioned, were nervous and defensive, blaming their son's \"manipulative\" behavior for involving outsiders. This experience ignited a flame within me, and I began to seriously consider a career in social work, where I could help those entangled in family disputes.\n\nAnother value integral to the field of social work is social justice. Our society touts the individual's importance and mourns those lost, yet the concept of the \"individual\" we hold is more often a reflection of archaic traditions than true uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to be like \"everyone else\"? I am an individual, unbound by the expectations of conformity. Throughout my academic journey, I have protested against social injustice in any way I could, from unnatural hair color to nonconformist clothing, ear piercings beyond the norm, and my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), all the while fighting against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice, and I will continue to stand against its injustices.",
            "The following text traverses the labyrinthine realms of the Biological and Sociocultural models as they pertain to the specter of insomnia. The Biological model delves into the esoteric dance of genes and inherited factors, intertwining them with the corporeal aspects of health. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural models cast their gaze upon the environmental tapestry, weaving race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status into the intricate fabric of insomnia.\n\nThe paper that follows is a meticulous exploration of these models, a journey through the research that seeks to illuminate these realms and elucidate the models that govern them. Each piece of research is scrutinized, its strengths and weaknesses laid bare for all to see.\n\nInsomnia, that specter of the night, can manifest in myriad forms: as a primary disorder, a shadow cast by another mental malady, or a phantasm born of medical complications or substance indulgence. The Primary disorders, Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, are the children of the night, while those born of Axis I or Axis II disorders are the puppets of madness and personality's dark siblings. The Dyssomnias, those who struggle to initiate or maintain sleep, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder. The Parasomnias, those who dance with the night in ways both strange and disturbing, include Sleep Terrors, Nightmare Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. This review, however, fixates on insomnia, and in passing, the Primary sleep disorders, under the magnifying lens of the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders is a tangled web of genes, heritable factors, and the physiological aspects of the malady. The hypothalamus, that ancient sentinel, guards the gates of sleep with its orexin neurons. A study conducted on mice revealed a sinister secret: the phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons, responsible for the dance of sleep and wakefulness. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces a trance that promotes sleep, while its inhibition stirs the fires of wakefulness. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in these nocturnal creatures, a finding that whispers of a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence of this receptor could be the hand that snuffs out the flame of adequate sleep, leaving one to stumble through life.\n\nThe Sociocultural implications of this study are as vast as the night sky. If the phenotype is inherited, it could be the hand that caresses sleep, a gentle touch that lulls one into rest. An alteration of this receptor could be the icy breath of the night, a chilling wind that disturbs the slumber. The impact on one's life would be as profound as the sweep of a storm, echoing through the hallowed halls of school, the boardrooms of career, and the monotonous tasks of the day.",

It is not a impairment of hearing, but a affliction of comprehension, a bane that leaves the soul deaf to the whisper of words amidst the cacophony of the world.\n\nThe history of this ailment echoes through the annals of time, dating back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first dubbed it \"auditory imperception\".

            "In the theatre of deceit, a mask may be a shield, but it is also a noose. Twelfth Night teaches us that beneath the guise of another, a man risks losing his true self. The end of a lie often leaves one adrift, estranged from those they have deceived, for some will find offense in truth. Yet, a difficult choice must be made: to retain one's own being or to preserve the bonds of those around. This is especially true in the realm of deception in gender role reversal, for it raises questions of identity and protection.

She becomes so convincing that Olivia confuses her with her twin, and falls in love. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) And her own heart aches, for she is drawn to Orsino, who sees her not as a woman, but as a boy. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nYet, this tale may hold a truth for the modern eye. It shows how a lie can force the hidden to the surface. Olivia and Orsino may have unspoken desires, brought to light by Viola's guise. \"Cesario,\" Olivia says, \"a sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) Has she fallen for Viola, or is it merely the mask that attracts her? We can't be certain, for Olivia seems more a parrot than a dove, judging by her appearance. She swiftly abandons Cesario, regarding her now as family. Thus, Twelfth Night teaches us that deception, while a dangerous path, may also be a road to truth.",
            "The German colonial might, often marked by a harsh and unforgiving hand, left an indelible stain on the annals of history, particularly in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Yet, as with any vast empire, the German colonial dominion presented a multitude of faces, each one as varied as the lands it claimed. Educational endeavors in these colonies mirrored this diversity.\n\nIn East Africa, now known as Tanganyika, the British found a populace that had been touched by the seeds of learning, sown by German educational initiatives. Yet, in South West Africa, a different narrative unfurled. The task of educating the native peoples was largely entrusted to missionaries, who received scant support from the government. The Europeans, however, enjoyed a more privileged status, with the government investing heavily in their education, establishing a system of state schools and providing robust support to missionary institutions.\n\nThe echoes of these policies resonated long after the German rule had faded. While other colonies boasted literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, its population mired in illiteracy. This divergence can be attributed to a myriad of factors, both social, political, and economic. This exploration seeks to delve deeper into these factors, with a particular emphasis on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans.\n\nThe literature on education within the German colonial empire is abundant, much of it penned in German and originating from the early twentieth century, during and shortly after the era of German colonial rule. These early works were largely descriptive, chronicling the features of the educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English works expanded this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses. Notable among these is Cohen's study, which compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, discussing the factors that contributed to their differences.\n\nSouth West Africa, unlike other German colonies, possessed a moderately temperate climate, with arid deserts covering much of its territory. This hospitable climate attracted a significant European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, a figure that dwarfed the next largest settler population in East Africa, which stood at 5,336.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has seen a remarkable expansion over the past century, encompassing an array of genres, numerous sub-genres, and even sub-sub-genres, making a definitive list seem an impossible task. From the raw, unbridled energy of rock to the intricate melodies of jazz, each genre has spawned its own offshoots, creating a labyrinth of musical expression. Among these, none perhaps has evolved as profoundly as Heavy Metal, a genre that has burgeoned into a sprawling, multifaceted movement over the past four decades.\n\nHeavy Metal, in its essence, is a symphony of darkness. It is a music of extremes—loud, ferocious, theatrical. It is a genre where musicians wield their instruments with a precision that borders on virtuosity. Heavy Metal is also a genre that has been inextricably linked with the psychedelic drug boom of the 1970s, with many musicians tapping into the altered states of consciousness to craft their most innovative, otherworldly works.\n\nThe darkness of Metal is not merely a stylistic choice; it is a manifestation of a deep-seated emotional landscape. Unlike many forms of popular music, Heavy Metal has long been a bastion for the darker, more visceral aspects of human emotion. It is a genre that has drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era, channeling the same dark, melancholic themes into its lyrics. The words penned by Byrne in \"Helter Skelter,\" for instance, exemplify this darker side of the movement:\n\n*Byrne:*\n\nThese lyrics, from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" demonstrate the darker underbelly of the musical landscape. It is a song that embodies the up and down, the volatility, supposedly of drug-induced states. Considered by some as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, it was a response to the heavier, darker sound of the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, in their quest to prove their heaviness, released this track on The White Album.",
            "In the twilight years preceding the surrealists' advent into the world of dreamlike art, Henri Rousseau, a man of modest means and even more modest education, was weaving his own dreams into the fabric of his canvases. \"The Dream\" of 1910, a work of art that would come to define his legacy, is not merely a depiction of a woman enthralled by the wonders of her slumbering realm; it is a reflection of Rousseau's own inner conflict, a battle between the desire to be accepted and the yearning to remain true to his unique vision.\n\nTo understand this painting fully, one must first delve into the life of its creator. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a small town in the northwest of France. His father, a tinsmith and hardware dealer, enjoyed a life of bourgeois comfort. However, the young Rousseau was not to benefit from his father's prosperity; instead, he was consigned to a life of labor, first as a municipal toll collector, later as a custom inspector, a position earned through his sobriquet, \"douanier.\" His life was marked by loss, the early deaths of his first wife and eight children, leaving him with only his daughter, Julia, and an abiding sorrow. It was in painting that he sought solace, a means to escape the harsh realities of his life and forge a new path.\n\nRousseau's struggle for acceptance is a tale not uncommon in the annals of art history. An uneducated man, late in life, he found himself amidst a thriving artistic scene, where many more renowned artists already commanded respect and admiration. He longed for the same recognition, yet his journey was fraught with the tension between conforming to the established norms of art and remaining true to his own unique voice. His desire for acceptance was not born out of vanity, but of a deep-seated need to be seen, to be understood.\n\nIn \"Modern French Painters,\" Jan Gordon posits that Henri Rousseau and Henri Matisse, two painters of seemingly contrasting styles and subjects, were united in their pursuit of recognition. However, their motivations were starkly different. Matisse, driven by a fear of triteness, sought to break the boundaries of art. Rousseau, on the other hand, dreamt of a picture so conventional that it would gain him admittance to the Artiste Français, a group he admired from afar.\n\nIn \"The Dream,\" Rousseau's internal struggle is laid bare for all to see. The woman in the painting, awestruck by the dreamworld she inhabits, is a mirror to the artist himself. She stands at a crossroads, torn between the familiar and the extraordinary, between the world of acceptance and the world of her dreams. It is this tension, this willingness to confront his own demons, that makes Henri Rousseau a truly remarkable figure in the annals of art history.",
            "In the vast expanse of thought, many a sage has posited a kinship between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. They are, after all, two sides of the same coin, for beauty is truth, and truth, beauty, as Keats so aptly put it, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" — \"That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of these twin realms is not born of study or mere experience, but rather, they are felt, like the breath of a distant wind, whispering secrets in the dark.\n\nCritique, it seems, is but a pale reflection of the essence of art or morality. A discourse on the Mona Lisa's worth may touch upon composition, color, or context, yet it fails to capture the heart of the matter. For when asked of a favorite piece, we often find ourselves resorting to terms like, \"there's just something about it,\" as if to suggest there's a mystery deeper than words can convey.\n\nBoth art and ethics, it seems, contain a ineffable quality, a je ne sais quoi that defies description. As Flannery O'Connor once wrote, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\" and this is true for ethics as well. Even the most thorough analysis of a literary work leaves something unsaid, an unspoken truth that hovers just beyond the reach of language. This is the transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics, their secret sinew, their hidden power.\n\nIt is this very transcendence that binds morality and art together, for we experience them in a way that is both profound and elusive. We feel it, but we cannot fully grasp it, like the touch of an ephemeral ghost. This is especially true for literature, for as McKean has said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts... is its moral quality.\" Literature, it seems, is not just a vessel of values, but a living embodiment of them.",
            "The Germany of this age, a forceful and unified entity, bears a singular culture, its roots tracing back from the gloom of the Alps in Munich, to the stark shores of the Baltic Sea in Kiel. This culture echoes through the streets of Cologne, along the Rhine, and into the heart of Dresden, on the Elbe. Such a culture, born of myriad sources and tribes, is not an anomaly. Germania, the ancestral land of the Germans, has a name whose origins are shrouded in dissent among scholars and historians.\n\nSome claim the name was bestowed by a Germanic tribe, the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. Yet, others suggest it was borrowed from the Gauls themselves, who used it to differentiate between those they had conquered and those they had not. The Roman general Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, employed this term, taken from the Gauls, to describe the tribes beyond the Rhine with whom they were engaged in perpetual conflict. The word's origin is uncertain, but it may derive from the spear the Germans wielded in battle, known as a ger, or perhaps from the Old Irish garim, meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' boisterous nature.\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" wrote of the Germans, \"I would deem them aboriginal, not mixed with other races through migration or intercourse. For, in times past, those seeking new lands would not travel by land to Germania but by ship. Who, driven by some folly, would forsake Asia or Africa for Italy to settle in Germania, with its wild lands, harsh skies, and sullen demeanor?\" And who, save the Romans, would choose to dwell among these tribes? Certainly not the Romans themselves. They would send forth their legions to these distant lands, seeking riches and to expand their empire, yet they would ultimately return to Rome.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes began to emerge in the first century, they inhabited the borders of the vast Roman Empire. They traded their goods and skills, serving in the ranks of the Roman army in exchange for Roman coin and protection. Thus, the stage was set for the convergence of cultures, the birth of a nation that would become Germany as we know it today.",
            "I gazed downwards, my mind as blank as the void before me. Unblinking, unyielding, it was a studied silence, an unrelenting comprehension that refused to give in to abstraction. Thoughts flickered and danced, ephemeral as the dust motes in the sunlight. My consciousness, a river of liquid thought, navigated the landscape before me with a practiced ease, as if my own thoughts were but currents in a vast and ancient sea.\n\nOnce, a man of art had advised me, a text he proffered, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since childhood, I had yearned for this skill, and this book promised to unveil the mysteries of line and form. Among its teachings was a technique, a square frame to tame the chaos of a scene, to reduce a riot of colors and shapes into a single, manageable entity.\n\nThere it was before me, a swirling maelstrom of brown, defiant in its ordinariness. The toilet, a humdrum object, now a monument to human folly. Picasso's blue period, Monet's greenery, the Italian Renaissance's prismatic hues - all pale in the face of this mundane tableau. Yet, in this moment, I felt the stirrings of something greater, the birth of a new story, Work in Brown.\n\nFingers traced the contours of my tool, a humble brush against the universe's canvas. Muscles tensed, released, as my hand moved through space, giving form to the thoughts that danced in my mind. Water swirled, a calm and serene sea, as my hand dipped into the abyss, a mother's gentle touch on her newborn child.\n\nThe offensive package, a rude message to the janitors of Rite Aid, remained unmoved, a stubborn, brown slug on the toilet's hard underbelly. More flushes, more moments of quiet introspection, and then my hand reached out, grasped the paper, and began its slow dance, a mummification of sorts.\n\nStanding tall, then bending low, my hand dipped into the bowl, a mother's tender touch on her Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "In the land where the young and reckless roam, their steel steeds of chrome and glass, the specter of youthful folly cuts a swath through the heartland, leaving behind a trail of wreckage and broken dreams. The National Institutes of Health, in their infinite wisdom, have unearthed a truth that is as stark as the Austin Peay: the adolescent mind, it seems, is not yet ready for the dance of death that is driving.\n\nThe roots of this calamity are many and entwined, like the gnarled fingers of an ancient oak. Inexperience, that most insidious of foes, lies at the core of this tragedy. The young driver, like a tender sapling, is ill-equipped to withstand the gales of speed and the tempests of the open road. They weave and careen, as if possessed by some demonic spirit, their paths leading them off the edge of the world, into the abyss.\n\nAnd when they are not alone, but in the company of their peers, the danger is magnified. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare the truth: the more numerous the passengers, the greater the likelihood of collision. It is a grim calculus, a macabre arithmetic of youth and insouciance.\n\nThe states, in their wisdom, have sought to mitigate this scourge with measures that are as ephemeral as morning mist. Provisional licenses, with their curfews and restrictions, are but a Band-Aid on a festering wound. The problem, plain and stark as the setting sun, is that the young drivers are, by all statistical measures, ill-equipped to bear the weight of responsibility.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman, in his relentless pursuit of understanding, has posited that even the tender age of 18 is too soon for the young to wield the keys to a motor vehicle. The thrill-seekers, those young knights of the open road, are drawn to the danger like moths to the flame. It is a natural impulse, a primal yearning, but one that must be tempered by time and experience.\n\nYet, we continue to bestow upon them the keys to the kingdom, and the death toll rises. By 2010, the children of the Baby Boomers will be ready, and the roads will run red with their blood. The legislation I propose is as simple as it is necessary. Schools can continue their tutelage, but no young hand should grasp the wheel until the age of 18. Provisional permits can still be issued, but no young soul should be granted unbridled power over a machine of death until they have proven themselves worthy.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not new, but it is necessary. It is a call to arms, a rallying cry for the preservation of our young. For if we do not act, if we do not raise our voices against this scourge, then the dust of the roads will be forever stained with the blood of the innocents.",
            "In the annals of the Library of Congress’s archive, I chanced upon a trove of early Edison films, numbering fifteen from the years 1895 to 1901. These were trick films, each a dance of creativity and deceit, their illusions woven by the subtle artistry of editing. My study of these films was a labor of loving detail, my gaze fixed on the poetics that underpinned most, and the eccentricities that marked a few of the later works. Trick films of that time, bound to the stage, bore the frontal proscenium like a badge of honor, unmoving cameras observing from afar, no camera movement, long and medium shots the norm, each one shot a film unto itself.\n\nYet, even these rigid rules were not unbreachable. Some dared to stray, introducing multiple shots, a rude awakening to the constraints of the one shot, one film mantra.\n\nThe stage was their realm, the camera held captive within the frame of the proscenium. Figures moved left to right, never venturing towards the lens, a limitation born of the theatre and vaudeville roots that birthed these films. In 'Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel' (1900), actors entered from the right, traversing the horizontal axis, vanishing from the frame without the camera's intervention.\n\nLong shots were the order of the day, with the occasional medium shot, close-ups a stranger to these films. Borrowed from the theatre, it was a full view the audience required, the borders of the stage framing the entire performance. Actors did not move towards the lens, so close-ups were strangers to these films.\n\nThe rule of one shot, one film reigned supreme, limiting length to a minute or less. Trick films were not for grand narratives, but for brief vaudeville-style tricks, magic, disappearing, and switching acts. Yet, a single conceptual shot hid a physical reality: a single “shot” was often a tapestry of joined frames, woven to deceive the eye.\n\nIn 'The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots' (1895), the illusion of a single shot hid the truth of multiple frames. Mary's severed \"head\" appeared in a physical shot, yet the film was conceived as one shot to the viewer.",
            "In the unforgiving expanse of Caroline, John Taylor emerged as a steadfast adherent to the creed of Republicanism. A man of the land, his agrarian roots and brief sojourn in politics forged a soul unyielding in the defense of personal liberty and governance. His reverence for the agrarian life colored his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the very bedrock of the judicial system itself.\n\nTaylor saw in the fledgling United States a canvas unmarred by native tradition, a chance to paint a society governed by itself. He held fast to the natural rights of man, believing them to be interwoven and indivisible. Deny one, and all are diminished, he argued, and these rights must be shielded from the grasp of the government. The state of nature, he posited, was a world ruled by the strong and the cunning, yet in civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nTo craft this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the inherent good and evil within man. A rigid dualist, he clung to the notion that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., p. 167). He deemed good principles those that safeguarded private property, advanced agriculture, and shunned capitalism. A government founded on such tenets, he believed, would function justly, despite the inevitable taint of avarice and self-interest that would lead its administration.\n\nSelf-interest, Taylor maintained, was the very essence of man, but it became a cancer when it fostered sub-societies that preyed upon others. A good government was necessary to keep man's natural evil in check, he argued, and even then, it must be watched vigilantly to prevent the intrusion of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He called for a Federal government shackled by the bounds of its explicit powers and wary of the cost and corruption that accompanies its expansion. Yet, he cautioned that a simple, literal interpretation was as perilous as it was seductive, without the compass of the writers' intent. The Declaration of Independence, he claimed, was the true charter of the United States, for it more clearly portrayed the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a monolithic whole.",
            "Upon revisiting Figure 17, it became plainly evident that there was a precipitous dip in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. This was something of a grim observation, and the cause of this decline remained unclear. The onset of winter in our New England locale, coupled with the end of the fall semester, were both plausible reasons for the reduced foot and bicycle traffic. The holiday season's encroachment did not help, as both students and faculty were consumed by their final tasks, with the commuter log seemingly falling off their radar. The winter months saw a natural ebb in momentum, a decline that we attempted to counteract with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This blitz, though successful in boosting submissions for that month, did little to combat the overall decline in participation.\n\nThe intrinsic appeal of driving, deeply ingrained in our culture, presented a further challenge. To combat this, we offered a variety of incentives: gift certificates for local eateries, coffee shops, massage parlors, an independent bookstore, and even some national chains. Yet, it was not beyond contemplation that larger prizes might have spurred greater engagement. A bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car could have been a more potent draw, especially if the larger prizes were revealed incrementally over the project's duration. The initial gift cards proved sufficient, but a more progressive escalation of prizes might have kept the project's momentum from faltering.",
            "In the realm of finance, an ETF, or exchange-traded fund, stands as a peculiar breed of security, designed to mimic the movements of an index, commodity, or a collection of assets much like an index fund, yet possessing the nimbleness to trade like a stock on the open market. An ETF offers the diversification of an index fund, the singular nature of stock ownership, and the versatility to sell short, purchase on margin, or buy as little as a single share in any transaction. These advantages, while enticing, come with the drawback of incurring commissions akin to those imposed on stock orders. The allure of ETFs also lies in the plethora of funds available, a consideration that prompts the astute investor to question whether the touted benefits, such as diversification, indeed manifest and to what extent.\n\nFor this exercise, we shall scrutinize the ETF IHF, comparing it to its top ten holdings, which constitute 63.58% of its total assets. Below are the top ten holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the fidelity of these ten stocks in representing the ETF IHF, we shall normalize the current percentage of assets to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming such a portfolio consisted entirely of these ten stocks in their proportional holdings. The results are as follows:\n\nFrom the above chart, it is clear that a portfolio composed solely of these top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 less than that of the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings might offer higher returns with a lower Beta. However, it remains to be seen if these two portfolios are statistically different from one another.\n\nTo ascertain this, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing them to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the annals of Edgar Allan Poe's literary corpus, \"Dream-Land\" is often hailed as one of his most haunting and enigmatic poems. Within its hallowed lines, Poe deploys the term \"Thulé,\" a nomenclature that echoes the ancient poetic tradition, tracing back to Virgil's invocation of a distant isle beyond the known world. Yet, there is more to the tale. For Poe, a man whose mind was a labyrinth of literary allusions, the term \"Thulé\" held a resonance born not of mere historical echoes, but of a more immediate and profound inspiration.\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his seminal work \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" posits a connection between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"The King of Thule.\" In this short poem, Goethe paints a portrait of a king bereft, his life desecrated by the loss of his queen. The parallels between \"The King of Thule\" and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are stark and unmistakable. The king's descent into despair, his heavy drinking, and his ultimate decision to cast his life into the sea resonate with a grim familiarity. It is as if Poe, in his own dark genius, had stepped into Goethe's shadow and whispered his own lament.\n\n\"The King of Thule,\" penned by Goethe and later transformed into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan, was published a mere twelve months before Poe's own use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" This temporal proximity lends credence to the notion that Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is, in many senses, a meditation on Goethe's \"The King of Thule.\"\n\nPoe's use of \"Thule\" in \"Dream-Land\" is not a mere coincidence, but a deliberate echo, a call and response to the literary landscape of his time. The landscape of \"Thule\" is not merely a geographical marker but a psychological state, a dark and desolate realm where the speaker is haunted by the specters of the past. This desolation, this lonely journey, is more than a simple poetic conceit; it is a reflection, albeit oblique, of the loss and despair that Poe himself may have felt.\n\nGoethe, a celebrated writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" was a figure of considerable literary significance in Poe's time. His influence was palpable, not merely through his own works, but through the many reproductions and adaptations that were circulating within the intellectual circles of the era. Poe's admiration for Tennyson, as evidenced in his own writings, suggests a deep respect for the literary traditions of the time. It is therefore not unreasonable to suggest that Poe's use of \"Thulé\" in \"Dream-Land\" is not just an echo of the past, but a conversation with the present, a dialogue with the literary ghost of his time.\n\nIn the end, Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is not just a poem about a dream, but a poem about a man lost in a world without color, haunted by the ghosts of the past. It is a poem that whispers of loss and despair, of a king who, like so many others, has been claimed by the sea. And in this, it stands as a stark testament to the continuing influence of the past, a past that Poe knew so well, and a past that he, in his own unique way, brought to life.",
            "Under the law of the Golden State, would a customer, struck down by fate and circumstance, be granted retribution for their pain and suffering if they had slipped and fallen on a spill of applesauce in a grocer's establishment? The answer may be found in the heart of the matter, in the actions of one Paul Martin, the store's manager. For what was his sin, but to know, and yet to do nothing, to turn his back on the cries of his customers, for the sake of a meal?\n\nThe law of California, in its wisdom, allows for such retribution when a defendant's actions are marked by a willful disregard for the safety of others, or when their conduct is so despicable as to warrant such a punishment. Jennifer Palmer, the unfortunate customer, could argue that Martin, with his knowledge of past slips and falls in the very same aisles, acted with a willful disregard for her safety. He failed to act, even as his employees warned him, even as the spilled applesauce lay like a trap, waiting for its next victim.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and nine, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager of the spill. \"I'm on dinner break,\" Martin replied, \"no time for such matters.\" Later, Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, relayed the same message, yet again, to no avail. At the stroke of half past five, Jennifer Palmer met her fate. Before her, five others had fallen, but still, Martin did nothing, preferring his meal to his duty.\n\nThe law, in its austere majesty, defines malice not as intent, but as action, or inaction, that shows a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others. Martin's failure to act, his willful disregard for the probable harm that would come to those who entered his domain, could be seen as such a crime.\n\nThe question remains, will his malice be punished? The courts will decide, but one thing is clear: Paul Martin's inaction, his willful disregard for the safety of his customers, makes him a man of despicable character. And that, perhaps, is the greatest punishment of all.",
            "Nearly four years hence, I undertook a course in the history of Islam at CBC. Amongst the heated debates that ensued, the question of Islam's hostility towards the world consumed much of our discourse. I believe this query more pertinent than ever in the wake of 9/11. The pendulum of American perception of Islam and extremism has swung wildly since that fateful day, from hostility to an almost fanatical tolerance. Could we, in the year 2001, have imagined a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, bearing a Muslim surname and familial ties to the faith?\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad, a chronicle that has captured my curiosity, presents a narrative that jars with my understanding of the man. Official history posits Muhammad as a subjugator, conquering tribes and forcing his faith upon them. Yet, the biography paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and humbled, with converts coming to his teachings of their own accord. This style of storytelling, I contend, seeks to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, living in truth and miracles, akin to the Messiah, yet it belies the true nature of his rise to power.\n\nIndeed, parallels exist between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad. The feeding of forty men with a meager portion of mutton and milk is but one such instance, a tale meant to elevate Muhammad's status, much like the miracles attributed to Christ. This, I argue, is a disingenuous ploy, a usurpation of the life and personhood of Jesus.\n\nFurthermore, many stories in the biography seem designed to authenticate Muhammad's teachings, depicting firsthand accounts of converts. Yet, these narratives often rely on second- or thirdhand sources, diminishing their credibility. The author's intent may be to present these as irrefutable proofs, but I find them suspiciously vague and unreliable.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to godly status, depicting him as humble, wise, and gentle. Historical records cast doubt on this portrayal, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history of their prophet's rise to power.",
            "The words of the Nazarene and the tenets he espoused in his brief sojourn among men were swiftly subsumed into the burgeoning tide of Christian thought that followed his departure. If one were to cast a gaze upon the annals of this faith, one could discern a trajectory that veers ever further from its origins. The world today bears witness to a rising tide of awareness and a relentless march of progress that seems both inexorable and imminent. Traditionalists, hued in the hues of yesteryears, will persist in their resistance to any idea that transcends what was whispered in the shadows of their youth. Yet, these stalwarts are but a fraction of the whole. Among the faithful, a growing consciousness of history will stir, compelling them to parse the doctrines appended over the centuries from the true intent of the religion's namesake. It matters not if this awakening takes decades or centuries to unfold; the outcome is as inevitable as the setting sun. A movement will swell, stripping away the accretions of doctrine one by one, as if time itself had reversed its flow. When this tide has crested and receded, all that will remain is a conception of what the Nazarene brought to humanity, unclouded by the claims of others. When this tide sweeps through the lands of the United States and Europe, it will carry with it a newfound reverence, as if we were once more in his time, heeding only his words. The church will stand strong, a beacon guiding the faithful. Yet, the theological clock having turned back, the profusion of diversity will yield to a uniformity of belief and practice. Where once there were divisions, there will be unity. This is not the first great reversion. The Romans, once persecutors of the faith, became its steward. Our nation, once the crucible of African-American servitude, now bears witness to their leadership. The great reversion that looms before us will unfold in the crucible of Christian belief, undoing history in its quest for the source, and in the process, unraveling the threads of diversity woven through Christendom. It is of paramount importance to acknowledge that this process will be made possible by a newfound understanding of the Nazarene's words, not as literal commandments, but as metaphorical parables. What, then, has transpired since his lifetime?\n\nIf we delve deep into the annals of time, we find only Judaism, the theological wellspring of Christianity. Monotheism, the revelation of a divine religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were the bedrock of this faith by the time the Romans took Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not as one in spirit. They were divided: the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the multitude of common folk.",
            "In the jaws of industry, Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" plucks at the rot within the human heart. The mind, it seems, is a ceaseless well of greed and self-preservation, ever seeking to elevate itself, regardless of the squalor it leaves in its wake. The factories, those monolithic behemoths, stand as a testament to the unyielding ambition of their masters. They care not for the pall of smoke that chokes the air, nor for the noxious runoff that befouls the land. Sinclair, in his stark prose, paints a grim portrait of the world below the gleaming chimneys: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" The owners and managers, like some malevolent gods, possess no regard for the living beings that toil beneath them. They care only for the ceaseless march of profit, the endless accumulation of wealth. The workers, too, are mere cogs in this machine, subject to the whims of their overlords. They are forced to labor in conditions that would break even the strongest of spirits, and are cast aside like worthless refuse when the tide of greed turns. The laws of the era, if they existed at all, offered little protection. The unions, once a beacon of hope, became but another shackle, their leaders more interested in lining their own pockets than in bettering the lot of the worker. Sinclair's words echo with the desperation of the downtrodden: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In the vast expanse of literature, authors employ sundry techniques to weave a certain atmosphere or attitude into the hearts and minds of their readers. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his magnum opus, \"The Great Gatsby,\" employs such techniques with calculated precision. He oftentimes pairs words that do not naturally align, imbuing them with a peculiar resonance. He also ascribes symbols with meaning, then deftly employs these symbols to evoke a certain feeling or impression.\n\nFitzgerald, in the hues of his novel, invests considerable significance into colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. The colors white/gray, in particular, he invests with the notion of uniformity, with white symbolizing a higher class and gray signifying age and decay. This is established early in the narrative with the constant use of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are \"in white\" (8), a state that extends to Nick's \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom's \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's \"powdered milky white\" (30) countenance. The only respite from this monochromatic reign is the \"gaudy\" colors of Gatsby's party.\n\nFitzgerald then extends this color scheme to mundane objects and people, reinforcing the association. Nick descends into \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names on his timetable are now \"gray names\" (61), Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), and plain people and places are described in white or gray. Even the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce this meaning is sufficiently established, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to signify unimportance or uniformity, especially in relation to Daisy. After a lengthy absence, Daisy re-enters the narrative \"dressed in white\" and driving a \"little white roadster\" (74), reducing her to a uniform, unattached object that Gatsby longs for. This technique is further applied, with a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her subsequent appearance in a white dress (115) before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color to convey these meanings is a masterclass in subtlety, a testament to his ability to weave symbolism into the very fabric of his narrative.",
            "San Diego County, a land of verdant productivity, owes its fertility to the caress of a mild, sun-kissed climate. The soil yields a bounty of tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A growing appetite for organic, community-supported agriculture has given rise to a thriving market, with local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are in high demand. Many farms here offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational pursuits. This kind of operation allows the landowner to avail themselves of government programs while enhancing habitat, thereby providing recreational use and generating income through tours and educational initiatives.\n\nOrganic farming, while profitable, presents its own unique challenges. The absence of chemicals necessitates meticulous labor and management to ward off pests and weeds, and the soil must be fertilized without the aid of synthetic substances. Losses, too, can be more frequent than with conventional methods. Additionally, the small-scale nature of these operations lacks the efficiency of larger enterprises. Non-farming practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops or managing plant growth, can also incur significant labor costs. This is why a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert guidance in balancing profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe parcel in question, adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It is situated within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently lists over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land, once inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries, was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years. In this scenario, a piece of property was selected from a real estate website, and available government programs were researched to understand the realistic options a small farmer might have for mitigating costs while preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model, an organic farm in the same area was studied.",
            "Culture, in the vast expanse of human endeavor, casts a long shadow. It is a tapestry woven with threads of history, prejudice, and belief, each strand not easily discernible from its neighbors. It is not a monolith nor a singular thing, but a collection of whispers and echoes from the past. Generalizations such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are like broad strokes on a blank canvas, oversimplifying the intricate dance of human nature.\n\nTo approach the negotiating table with an understanding of culture is to step into a strange land, where the familiar seems alien and the alien, familiar. It is not about passing judgment or imposing one's own standards, but about acceptance and accommodation. When one finds oneself in a culture foreign to their own, one must navigate its labyrinthine paths with respect and humility, especially when the ground beneath their feet is uncertain.\n\nThe borders of culture are not drawn by mere national or international boundaries. Within the heart of any society lies a myriad of corporate cultures, each with its own rhythm and language. A culture may be seen in the dress of its employees, the tone of their communications, the way they delegate tasks. Some cultures celebrate philanthropy, others restrict it to approved causes. The American corporate landscape is a patchwork of such cultures, from the towering skyscrapers of New York to the sprawling suburbs of the Midwest.\n\nBut it is the values of a culture that truly matter. They are the heartbeat of a society, the reason behind every decision, every action. If a culture values harmony, then a negotiator must tread lightly, lest they cause a ripple that becomes a wave. If a culture prizes a hard bargain, then a negotiator must be ready to stand firm, to weather the storm. Understanding these values before the first words are spoken can be the difference between success and failure.\n\nYet, a negotiator should not stop at the surface level. To truly understand, one must delve deeper, to learn the personal stories that make up the fabric of a culture. It is in these personal narratives that the true heart of a culture lies.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" - Psalm 14, a verse echoed by St. Anselm in his quest to prove the existence of the Almighty. Aquinas, too, stands in this camp, defending the same deity in his own way. For the purpose of this discourse, let us assume both men are correct, for it is their belief in the God of the Bible that unites their arguments. We seek to compare their proofs, but first, we must acknowledge the limitations of our approach. To consider a divinity differing from the one they serve would muddy our waters, for they argue for this one, this specific God.\n\nAnselm's path is one of faith, of looking inward to find the truth of God. He posits that because God resides within our understanding, we cannot comprehend His nonexistence. This is a complex, meandering argument, but its essence is simple: the proof for God lies within our own minds. He suggests we need not venture beyond our souls to find truth, but that God's existence is evident to us, inherently known. This is the essence of faith, an acceptance of unseen evidence.\n\nAquinas, however, walks a different path. He believes God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This would be a boon for the Church, as it would allow for conversion without reliance on unwavering belief. Aquinas sets forth five logical arguments supporting his claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each demonstrates that the proof for God lies in the logical necessity for Him. If one piece of a puzzle is missing, one can deduce its features and existence without seeing it.",
            "In the dim light of a fifth or sixth century BCE dawn, a prince was born who would one day be known as the Buddha. His journey led him to renounce the world and find enlightenment, leaving teachings that would give birth to Buddhism, the most ancient sect known as Theravada. Twenty-five hundred years have passed, and the religion has changed, as can be seen in the annual water-cutting ceremony celebrated in Sri Lanka, a land of Theravada. Monks and laymen alike participate, though Buddha himself never taught such a rite. This is but a symptom of the myriad changes that have taken place, from the outward traditions to the very heart of the religion's doctrine. Both the monastic and lay communities have altered their doctrinal principles over time, shaped by forces both from within and without, some hostile, others benign.\n\nWe shall make frequent use of certain terms: internal and external forces, the former wielded by the Buddha's own, regardless of their monastic status, the latter by those who are not Buddha's. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or damage the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces, while not wishing harm, may inadvertently cause it. These terms shall recur throughout this discourse.\n\nFirst, we must examine the core of the religion, the tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Seekers of the path find refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, with its rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, delving into Buddhism's metaphysical notions, such as Anatta, no self, Dukkha, inherent suffering, and Anicca, impermanence. Recognizing these concepts leads one from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and the cessation of lobha, desire, dosa, hatred, and moha, delusion, when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, five for laymen (I shall not kill, nor lie, nor steal, nor misbehave sexually, nor take intoxicants) and many more for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: life is suffering, attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The lands of America and Mexico, once bound in a ceaseless strife that spanned half a century, from 1836 to 1893, bore witness to a rivalry that would leave its mark on both nations. The apex of this enmity was the Mexican-American War, a conflict that saw the United States emerge victorious, securing Texas and the American Southwest as its own. Other skirmishes, though less catastrophic, still marked the border, a testament to the enduring nature of this rivalry. The strife between these two nations began with differences in faith, culture, and tradition, and was further fueled by mutual material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis animosity is not unique to these two lands. Nations that share a border often find themselves in disputes over territory and resources, as if the very earth itself is a contentious matter. The United States and Mexico are but two among many who have known this fate, with David M. Pletcher (1977) noting that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). The proximity of these nations to the United States, and their shared history, have made them constant rivals, unlike other nations in Latin America which have enjoyed more harmonious relations.\n\nThe roots of the rivalry can be traced back to religious differences, a theme that has echoed through history. Sally Frahm (2001) observes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). The ideological clashes between the United States and Mexico were born of this religious divide, a mistrust that ran deep, rooted in the historic enmity between the English and Spanish. This legacy of distrust was a formidable obstacle in forging amiable relations between the two nations.\n\nThe period of this rivalry, as documented by Diehl and Goerts (2000), saw 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States. The majority of these disputes were territorial in nature, stemming from border raids and other frontier issues. Outlaws and bandits from American towns would cross the border, causing chaos and discord, a problem that persisted until both nations exerted their military might to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). The rivalry began to wane as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen winters ago, a spectral malady struck, and I was felled by an ailment that had never whispered its name to me. I was a nurse, drawn to the job by a desperate hunger for refuge, a sanctuary that childhood had denied me. \"You'll always find a place in the world, for sickness is constant,\" they said, and so, I chose the path less desired, the one that others deemed secure.\n\nYet here I am, at forty-six and alone, penniless, and unable to earn a living. The years have passed, and still, the illness holds me in its iron grip. After fifteen years of subsistence on Social Security Disability, I am bereft, stripped bare of all that was once mine. Each day is a battle, a relentless onslaught against the security, the safety, and the self-worth that once were my shields.\n\nLet me tell you this, there will always be calamities, great and small, that will befall us. Not a single one can be warded off, nor overcome, without the aid of others. It is a harsh truth, but one I know from experience.\n\nI acknowledge the need for reform, to ceasingly trust in the faltering beast that is our government. But I yearn for something more, a return to the days when we trusted in one another, when we reached out a hand and asked for help. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies, they did not do so alone. They relied on one another, on compassion and mutual respect, and the sharing of what little they had.\n\nSo, be prepared, yes. I have my provisions, my supplies, my stash of candles and matches, my cans of food. If you have the land and the will, tend to your own food source, build your own hearth, but as you do so, look around. Know your neighbors, for in times of calamity, they may be your only sanctuary.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve as they do‭—‬Are there limitations or constraints that guide the path of evolutionary change‭? ‬In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson observed that even the simplest organic forms elude precise mathematical description. Yet, in our contemporary epoch, mathematical modeling has embraced the complexity of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing its trajectory through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬cf.‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our investigation into Prunum, a genus of mollusk, seeks to unravel the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change by intertwining mathematical modeling with empirical study. Utilizing X-radiographic images, we have identified quantitative parameters that, like the constellations, chart the path of hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters are fed into CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬, a software program that models these trajectories. Our hypothetical shell morphologies delineate the bounds of possible morphological transformations, and these findings converge with experimental and descriptive studies to illuminate macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nConsider the shell as a serpentine tube that winds through three hundred and sixty degrees of space, its convolutions known as whorls, which coil around an imaginary axis, the columella. The pace of whorl enlargement varies, with a continuous line separating each, called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, the body whorl, is the last. The spire consists of all whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through a portal called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nCounting whorls begins by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and noting the first suture's beginning. A line divides the shell into two halves, and counting commences from this point, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be perceived as a series of temporal and spatial apertures, a path traced by the coordinates of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once formulated, parameters can be varied, and the mollusk's skeletogenesis can be modified.",
            "In the realm of the archipelago of Indonesia, the specter of neonatal and infant mortality has remained an unyielding scourge for a decade past. Though the nation has much to be proud of in its pursuit of Millennium Development Goals, with strides made in water and sanitation, the scourge of maternal and child health remains a blight upon the land. This decay is a testament to the need for a robust health system, rather than the mere application of band-aid programmatic interventions.\n\nThe birth rate in the presence of skilled health workers has seen an uptick, now reaching 72% of all births. Yet, this measure is a double-edged sword, for it includes traditional midwives who cannot offer medical remedies should complications arise. As a result, the specter of maternal death looms large, born of hemorrhage. The treatment of diarrheal cases in children under five has seen a decline, as has postnatal care, which remains largely unrecorded but no less problematic.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low at 4%, with a stark disparity between urban and rural areas. In the cities, the rate stands at 7%, a stark contrast to the 2% in the countryside. This inequity is a reflection of the prioritization of urban healthcare, leaving the rural dwellers to fend for themselves. The gulf between the poorest and richest quintiles in healthcare utilization stands at a staggering 27%. The poor, it seems, are left to languish in the shadows, their plight exacerbated by the high costs of out-of-pocket expenditure.\n\nAs we look towards the horizon of improvement in neonatal and maternal care, the most pressing question remains: how to best combat the endemic lack of service? Should Indonesia focus on targeted programmatic approaches, or strengthen the overall health system? There is no denying the allure of programmatic solutions, with their clear, manageable objectives and swift results. Yet, the shadow they cast is long, for they can lead to a dearth of funding for other sectors and a hive mentality of human resources drawn to the area with the most resources.\n\nMoreover, the proliferation of such programs can lead to a labyrinth of duplicated services, uncoordinated and mired in the quagmire of forms and paperwork. It is a conundrum, a predicament that demands a delicate balance between targeted intervention and systemic improvement.",
            "Victorian novels, a labyrinth of intricate detail and the gilded world of the nobility, find their echoes in Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, two works that, like strange outliers, bear an air of mystery and the exotic. These novels, though, are more akin to surrealist canvases, where the bizarre and the enigmatic dance with the characters, lending them an eerie depth that illuminates their true selves. The former, in particular, employs such elements through dreamlike states, a technique that reveals Oliver's inner turmoil, his anguish, and the truth of his circumstances.\n\n\"Now, a host of bewildering and confusing thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to walk again between Sikes and Crackit, their voices echoing in his ears, as if the words were still being spoken. He found himself conversing with them, the very air heavy with their angry dispute. Suddenly, a report shattered the air, and a cacophony of shouts and lights flooded his vision. An unseen hand bore him away, through a maelstrom of noise and tumult. A constant, undefined pain gnawed at him, a torment that refused to wane, even as he was carried through the chaos.\"\n\nThe shooting, a pivotal moment revisited in chapter 28, is relived by Oliver as if in a dream, his struggle to find aid starkly depicted. The lack of control he feels over the events that unfold is stark, his health's dire state evident in the hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit, his senses numbed as he is borne away. The shooting itself is a relentless agony, his despair eternal, untainted by the initial shock of pain. Instead, fear and hopelessness reign supreme. The question remains, whose will brought about his misfortune? Certainly not his own. This shooting underscores his powerlessness, his inability to control his fate, even when his life hangs in the balance. A growing despondency is implied, as if old Fagin's influence has begun to break him, reducing his capacity to react, forcing him to accept this despair.\n\n\"The day... or was it a day? It passed as swiftly as it came, and night arrived, long and silent, yet fleeting in its endless dance. Night, a relentless specter, brought with it an endless, dreadful silence, and yet, it was gone as quickly as it had come.\"",
            "A few years back, I found myself in an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. I aimed to assist them in their struggles, whatever the subject may be, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One youngster named Adrian, whom I believed to be in the third or fourth grade, presented a peculiar challenge—he had significant trouble reading. It became clear that something was amiss; he could pronounce certain letters perfectly while others were entirely foreign to him. His strange predicament, somewhat puzzling, was further complicated by the fact that he was of Latino descent yet spoke perfect English. Our toils continued until one fateful day when his mother walked in. She spoke only Spanish, and my meager grasp of that language forced us to communicate in a manner akin to a code. That day, it dawned on me: Adrian could read, but he was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. Though I cannot say if this revelation bore much fruit, I hope Adrian has since improved.\n\nI recount this tale to shine a light on the language barrier in our schools, particularly in California. It serves to demonstrate that the issue is not always as apparent as one might think. Even a child fluent in English can face immense obstacles when it comes to reading. We all acknowledge this problem, so what is the solution? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, specifically the alphabet and pronunciation, proved effective. But for those with barely a grasp of English, the solution is much more intricate. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes is needed.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system holds great promise. Not only for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research has shown that children in such programs outperform their peers academically. However, much fear and concern surround this idea, with some believing it to be a waste of resources. This is a false notion; if implemented widely, all children would benefit. But how do we achieve this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unrealistic. Yet, I propose that we employ bilingual aids or tutors to bridge the gap.",
            "From cradle to grave, we are whispered tales of an enigmatic force that dwarfs our own comprehension. Some of us are led to Sunday schools, others to temples, and still more delve into their own souls for answers. Many embrace the faith passed down, while others reject it, denying the existence of anything beyond our narrow self-interest. We vacilate, shifting our values as if they were mere sandcastles at the mercy of the tide. Yet, we all embark on a pilgrimage to define ourselves, each seeking our own peculiar light in the dark.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my pa said, when I pressed him on his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming against the tin roof overhead, our cigarettes flickering in the gloom. The gutters were swollen, washing away the remnants of the once-proud plants. He stared into the rain, eyes distant, recalling or perhaps searching for something lost. His frame had grown gaunt, clothes hanging slack, hair thin and gray. Our eyes met not, his gaze flicking away like a flight of birds. I felt adrift, fearful, and silent, for speaking would only make the inevitable more real. I embraced him, retreated, and drew my chair closer to his, both gazing into the falling rain of June's dusk.\n\nBy December, my pa was gone, five days after my twenty-second year's mark. Chemo and radiation did little to ease his suffering, merely prolonging it beyond the doctors' predictions. What purpose served this cruel extension, I pondered in the quiet of night.

            "The antiquated \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt elucidates in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is a curious oxymoron, a fusion of \"Old\" and \"New.\" Praised and reviled in equal measure, it was condemned for lacking true substance and lauded for its evocation of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). At its genesis, the Gothic mode was born of the union of ancient and modern romances, as seen in Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole, in his \"Gothic Story,\" employed elements both old—theatrical trappings—and new—the novel's personal introspection—to forge a path uncharted. The Gothic, with its echoes of medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, was viewed as a relic, archaic and unsophisticated amidst the heady advances of modern society. Yet, it persists, obsolete and new, a paradox that resonates through time.\n\nOne tenet that permeates the Gothic is the concept of Chivalry. In its essence, it is the training of a proper knight, a remnant of medieval ideals, yet transmuted in Walpole's work. Walpole, in the throes of political turmoil and personal despair, may have seen in the chivalric ideal a morality and goodness lost in the present. Through characters like Frederic, he ideals of the chivalric past are romanticized, hinting at the evolving Gothic to Romanticism. Frederic, a prince, is described thus:\n\n\"The gallant and courteous Knight,\" his figure exaggerated, embodying the Gothic trope of excess.",
            "Supply chain management, a labyrinth of processes that weaves together the threads of a business, from the loom of customer orders to the rafters of raw materials, and down through the silos of production and distribution, until it reaches the customer's doorstep. The term, coined in '82 by a consultant named Keith Oliver, is a cipher for the art of planning, executing, and governing the flow of goods and information to satisfy the fickle beast that is the modern consumer. Six pillars support this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nThe first of these, production, is the crucible of the entire process. It is here that decisions are forged, like iron in a furnace, to answer the questions: When? Why? Where? And how? The manager must divine the desires of the market, a fickle creature that shifts like sand. Once the market's heart is understood, the manager can decide what to produce and how much. The choice of where to produce, and which forge to use, is crucial; it must balance volume with quality, and always keep the customer's satisfaction at the forefront. Only then can the manager set about scheduling workloads and maintaining the machinery.\n\nThe second pillar, supply, is a strategic dance of decisions, like a chessmaster playing a game of life and death. It involves determining the core strengths of a facility and negotiating with outsourced partners. A factory may have many divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose which division is best suited for each process. Outsourcing may also be an option, to gain velocity - the ability to provide quality and flexibility while keeping costs low. But remember, every decision echoes down the line, and a wrong move can bring the whole chain crashing down.",
            "In the sultry, dust-choked streets of Rangoon, a sign clings to a wall, a stark declaration: Hitler lives, whispered by the shadows of the past that cling to this land. A lone figure stands there, Ellen Page, her eyes haunted, her fingers gripping a scrap of cardboard. Burma, where the colors of the robes worn by the monks are a beacon of hope, yet the red blood they spill is a grim testament to the power that rules here.\n\nThe air is thick with the stench of corruption and the echo of silence. The junta has held its grip for decades, their thirst for power unquenched. In '62, they seized the reins of government in a coup, and now, they hold their people in an iron grasp. Monks, the spiritual heart of the country, took to the streets, their robes a sea of saffron against the dark tide of oppression. The Saffron Revolution, they called it, a desperate cry for freedom. But the junta, they crushed the spirit of the monks, their monasteries turned into battlegrounds, their sanctity defiled.\n\nForeign eyes were not welcome here. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, paid the ultimate price, his death a chilling warning to all who would dare to look closer at the reality beneath the surface. The official death toll? A mere 13, a number that pales in the face of Colonel Hla Win's defiant truth: \"Many more have fallen. The bodies can be counted in countless thousands.\"\n\nThis is not a new dance. The beast of tyranny has danced through history, from the Roman emperors who claimed god-like power, to the Japanese who believed their rulers descended from the gods themselves, to our own land, where a president stands tall with a man who preaches the gospel of stupidity. Tiananmen Square, a blood-soaked square, where the spirit of dissent was met with the iron fist of the government. The Rwandan genocide, where the stench of death filled the air as Hutu militia groups, with the government's blessing, began their grim work. And Hitler's Third Reich, a dark stain on the history of man, where the Jewish people were rounded up like cattle, their lives snuffed out like candles in the wind.\n\nBut the spirit of the monks, the silent protest of Ellen Page, the echoes of voices silenced, they persist. They are the ghosts of the past, the harbingers of a future where the light of freedom triumphs over the dark tide of oppression.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz is woven with the threads of his endurance and the creative tapestry he wove for his ensemble. His touch on the piano is a quiet, almost unassuming presence in many of his compositions, yet as a composer, he excelled in crafting rich, intricate pieces that allowed each band member to shine like a beacon. Ellington created a framework wherein a soloist could wander freely, writing passages that leaned on the particular tone and style of each member to illuminate the music's core. His mastery of each player's voice, and how they blended into a cohesive whole, led him to pen some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its examination of Ellington's sound and innovation, points to \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This early composition, a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues, showcases Ellington's ability to add texture and color without lyrics, and to complement the style of his soloists. The piece unfolds in six choruses, each a microcosm of Ellington's genius:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning smooth and melodic, then morphing into a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus in a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds, the voice now growling like an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a layer of tonal complexity to this piece is but one instance of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington weaves his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing marries the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, as Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone.\n\nEllington's ability to mold the unique voices of his musicians into a cohesive, innovative sound is a testament to his genius.",
            "She'd always felt a gnawing emptiness, a hunger that gnawed at her soul. It began when she was fourteen, as the world turned its eyes on her, and it remained, a yearning that refused to abate. At seventeen, she no longer sought things; she yearned for a connection, yet no boy had ever stirred her. Some had tried, their clumsy overtures a dance of desperation, but none had been successful. She questioned this strange absence, plaguing her mind with theories that amounted to little more than whispers in the dark.\n\nHer home was usually a sanctuary, a place of quiet calm. Her father and mother were a pair of silent sentinels, their voices soft as the wind through the trees. Arguments were rare, their daughter's spirit a storm that did not break their truce. Yet, today was not like the others. As she wandered, seeking some new spark in her life, she heard it - a cry, sharp as a blade, her mother's voice echoing in pain. She rushed, her heart a drum in her chest, to find her mother lying on the floor, her breath coming in short gasps. \"Mama?\" she cried, her voice a plea. \"What's wrong?\"\n\nHer mother's face was a mask of pain, her eyes swimming with tears. \"Sweetheart,\" she whispered, her voice a fractured thing. \"Hospital. Need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter nodded, a fierce determination in her eyes. She was her strength, her mother's shield. She carried her to the car, her muscles burning, and drove. The hospital was a place of antiseptic and fear, but she did not see it. Her mind was a whirlwind of worry, her heart a drumbeat of dread.\n\nThe vase. Her mother had fallen from the step stool, reaching for the vase. A simple thing, a moment's misstep, and yet it had brought her to this. She waited, her heart a drum in her chest, as the doctors swarmed around like vultures.",
            "This investigation sought to demonstrate that adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as evidenced by a high \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) diet score, is correlated with a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a variant of the Med diet, emphasizes higher consumption of plant foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, alongside monounsaturated fats and fish, while restricting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permissible.\n\nPrevious studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and both total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, with intervention trials revealing the Med diet's superiority over low-fat diets in facilitating weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. Prior investigations did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, with no history of CVD or diabetes, participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a 121,700 female nurse cohort across 11 US states. Over six intervals, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses remained participants throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Incident CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke cases were confirmed through medical, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were evaluated for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity assessed beginning in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (by averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) through adjustments for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile exhibited a reduced risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annus mirabilis of 2007, the once-great United States of America found itself mired in a financial quagmire that would leave the nation reeling for years to come. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the housing market teetered on the brink of collapse, and many of the nation's most formidable corporations were left desolate and unyielding. This calamity, which still echoes through the halls of power, begs the question: what transpired to bring about this catastrophe, and how might we avert such a calamity in the future?\n\nThe seeds of this calamity were sown in the halcyon days of the Clinton reign, as the President sought to secure a second term by appeasing the masses. To this end, the administration loosened the reins on lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes, of the New York Times, foretold the impending doom in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" He would go on to prophecy, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nMany factors conspired to send the nation into a tailspin, but chief among them was the labyrinthine structure of mortgages that had been constructed. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) entwined the nation's financial markets in a complex and perilous web. This, in turn, left households and financial institutions alike dangerously exposed to the housing market's whims.\n\nIndeed, the housing market's bubble burst, and the institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities found themselves spurned. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a staggering sum that accounted for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a fraction of their worth, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to assume the mantle of commercial banks, subject to the iron fist of regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under the watchful eye of the government in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That dark, abysmal realm where the writer's pen doth drown in the mire of mundane details, birthing a tale as lifeless as the corpses it describes. It is the bane of the writer's existence, a scourge that can either captivate or bore the reader to the point of death. Dr. Merlin herself has cried out in anguish before her monitor, her voice echoing through silent halls as she finds herself adrift in the sea of Too Much Information, a voyage fraught with nary a whisper of the thrilling narrative she had intended to craft.\n\nExposition is no friend of the writer, yet it is an evil that must be vanquished. My gentle readers already know the holy writ, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in the coils of exposition's serpentine embrace, in other words, in the miry clay of excessive prose.\n\nExposition is the teller of tales, the narrator who spills the beans, the one who informs us of the past without the benefit of sensory input. In film, exposition is the monologue, the outpouring of information from one character to another, akin to the ballad of the ancient mariner. In fiction, it is the author's voice that speaks the words, the stage upon which the actor of the past doth dance.\n\nConsider, if you will, a tale of a heroine and her beloved. 'Twas told that they met at such a place and time, that they wed in grand ceremony, and that her husband was slain before her very eyes. Wouldst thou expect this tale to span two pages, in which neither uttered more than two words? Nay, the author doth owe the reader a feast of words, a banquet of characters, a symphony of emotions. The husband's love should be evidenced in his speech and manner, and the heroine's heart should be laid bare in the smallest of gestures, so that thou mightst mourn with her and grow to love her as thou wouldst love thyself.\n\nIn short, thou must provide flesh to the bones of thy story, for 'tis not enough to merely say that they met, they wed, he died. The reader craves more, dear heart, more than the simple truth. They crave the tale that will make their hearts flutter, their souls stir, their blood boil. They crave the tale that will make them weep, that will make them laugh, that will make them feel alive.\n\nSo, when thou findest thyself tempted to rush past certain things, to mention the Air Force days of a gas station manager, the two failed marriages, the secret dreams of owning the station and the breakfast of champions, remember this: the reader doth not want a list. They want a story. A story that will make them care, that will make them feel, that will make them remember long after the last page is turned.",
            "I beheld two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, one a live affair, the other a mere echo. NBC 4 they called it, and the first tale they spun was of a man in Ashley, Ohio, who'd plunged a blade into his wife's flesh. Evil did not mar his visage, yet pure malice gleamed from his eyes. Two minutes they gave him, no more, as the tale was still unraveling.\n\nAnother story, of a young man named Travis Buyers, shot down in Sharon Woods, his life hanging by a thread. No arrests, no suspects, the SWAT team prowled the woods. The tale was brief, almost as if the color of his skin, or the hue of the neighborhood, dictated its length.\n\nA gunshot through the Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle, it seemed. Five thousand dollars they offered, for a lead to the shooter. The weather forecast followed, thunder and rain, temperatures mid-eighties. A teaser, they called it, to keep the audience glued to the screen.\n\nA robbery at Clime Road UDF, a dark-skinned man in a hoodie, six feet tall, one-fifteen pounds heavy. The tale they spun, a dance of detail, the color of his skin the rhythm, a strange beat.\n\nA drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic man, twenty-five years in prison. But they spoke of three hundred months, as if the weight of the sentence might be lost in the arithmetic. His skin, his origin, they said, as if they felt it necessary.",
            "There is a bond between brothers, an unyielding, unbroken bond. Within this bond, emotions swirl like dark waters: love, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Brothers see in one another their own reflections, and in the direst of circumstances, the true nature of this bond is laid bare, whether it be for good or ill. The cost of understanding these emotions is steep, for they carry with them a heavy burden. When one gazes into the eyes of their brother, they see not what others see, but what they truly are. In their actions and the repercussions thereof lies their true character.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers navigate this theme, and the raging emotions that accompany it. Through a landscape lush and vividly described, these two boys embark on a hopeless journey. Bitter resentment and intense pride collide in the climactic scene, and only one brother survives the ordeal. The theme is expressed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's point of view, which elucidates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him, both of which shape his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first venture together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother to teach all his worldly skills, to run, jump, climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp, to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. But Doodle's frail heart made these dreams impossible. He was born with a heart so weak that it was unlikely he would even survive, let alone participate in such vigorous activities. What a bitter blow to the young protagonist's wild fantasies! He even contemplates suffocating Doodle with a pillow, a child's dark secret. Yet, when Doodle smiles at him, hope is kindled, and his resolve weakens. His heart, despite his anger, contains an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the annals of mortal intellect, the brain is an intricate, labyrinthine tapestry, woven with threads of thought and information. As the arc of technological progress unfurls, so too have the metaphors spawned to describe the ineffable workings of our minds. From the ancient wax tablet to the parchment scroll, from the bound volume to the machine, each metaphor has its utility and its limitations.\n\nThe dance of perception commences with the humble sensors, which translate the exterior world into electrochemical whispers. This symphony of signals, both ascending and descending, is the brain's ballet. In the example of a black box against a white expanse, the bottom-up process assembles the simplest of elements - hue, alignment, and perimeter - to declare the presence of a box. The top-down, however, emboldens this recognition, imbuing the object with significance - a black box, not a hollow in the void.\n\nThe sieve of attention, ever vigilant, sifts and selects. While the brain may feast on the minutiae of a field of grass, it discards the inconsequential, allowing us to hear our own name in a clamor of noise. This dance of cognition is a delicate choreography, where the fruits of perception are repeatedly refined and moderated by the filter of attention.\n\nInformation, to be processed, must first be captured. The brain's memory is a vast repository, its contents encoded in myriad ways. The visual, the auditory, the verbal - each has its own cipher. In the realm of long-term memory, the structure of proteins is postulated to maintain our enduring thoughts. The organization of this knowledge is a matter of debate, with models ranging from the retrieval patterns of humans to the algorithms of the machine, each offering a different lens through which to view the mind's vast landscape.",
            "In the grim pages of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a dystopian vision unfurls, a critique of the encroaching tide of technology and the capitalist structure that supports it. The society depicted here values community above the individual, and from the cradle to the grave, its citizens are conditioned to pursue immediate gratification above all else. They are little more than pawns in a grand game, their ideologies shaped by the iron will of the World Controller. Through the lens of Marxist thought, Huxley's novel reveals a deep-seated suspicion of the systems that govern us, with terms like homogeny and reification reinforcing the notion that this is a commentary on the flaws inherent in the emerging economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism, in Huxley's vision, is a beast that feeds on the false consciousness of its subjects. The common folk are blinded by their own desires, unable to see the true nature of their economic relations. They are, as Marx would put it, \"falsely conscious,\" their interests manipulated by the ruling class. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, and the like, have no will of their own, their desires for consumption and indulgence stoked by the hypnopædia, a tool of the World Controller. Hegemony, the dominance of one class over another, is writ large in this world, as the lower classes are unaware of their own oppression, buying into an ideology that supports their own exploitation. The upper classes, the Alphas and Betas, are born into this knowledge, yet few act against it, accepting their place in the hierarchy.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and superficial, a reflection of the society's devaluation of personal expression. Love and deep emotion are absent, replaced by a focus on physical appearance and trivial encounters. The characters, even the major ones, lack depth, their interactions reduced to mere transactions. This is a society where the rise of technology and capitalism has stripped individuals of their free will and expression.\n\nThe obedience of each class to their place in the hierarchy is a symptom of this socioeconomic oppression. They are false proletariats, convinced of their own superiority so long as they consume, obey, and conform to the expectations of their peers. This is the world Huxley presents to us, a chilling mirror of our own times, a warning whispered in the cold wind of a dystopian future.",
            "In this land of towering edifices and sprawling expanses, I've worn the path of the student for nigh on two and three-quarters years. The University Park sprawls vast and wild, a beast that devours time and stamina in equal measure. My freshman year found me ensconced in the farthest reaches of East Halls, a sanctuary of solitude where the winds howl and the shadows grow long. To traverse this kingdom from my humble abode to the heart of the campus, where the Willard building stands tall and proud, would take the stout-hearted half an hour, if the elements were not conspired against me in their myriad forms. Speak with the aged and the wise, and they'll tell you of times when the East Halls were isolated, separated from the rest of the school by vast, untamed lands. Now, those same lands have been tamed, filled with the hum of activity, the clatter of construction, the scent of new growth. Yet, as the campus swells, so does the burden of navigating its ever-changing landscape.\n\nA bicycle, they say, is the answer to this conundrum. Yet, a bicycle alone will not suffice. It requires a willing rider, and a campus that bends to its needs. I've spoken with a friend, a man who'd abandoned his steed for a time, who now marvels at the simplicity of it all. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"they're the only way to make sense of this place.\" And indeed, they are. A hearty breakfast and a little sweat can see you through the longest of journeys. I, too, have succumbed to the allure of the bicycle. My abode off-campus, like the dorms it once surpassed, stands at the edge of this kingdom. Yet, a bike has made the distance bearable. The Thomas building, a mere twenty minutes' walk away, is now but five minutes' ride. Yet, Pollock Road, the straightest path to my destination, is not without its trials. The wind and the inclines, they would test the mettle of any man or machine. And so, I walk, but only when necessity dictates. For time is a precious commodity, and I've learned to cherish it. To spend an extra half-hour each day walking, when I could be learning, is a sacrifice I'm unwilling to make. A bike, it seems, is not merely a mode of transport, but a way of life. And in this kingdom of academia, it's a way of life I've come to embrace."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I am drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I intend to dedicate myself to the care of those who have been abused or neglected, and to provide support for troubled families. The values that I bring to this field are service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to ethical practice, both in my personal life and my professional work. These are not merely values I hold for the sake of social work; they are the cornerstones of my being.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been a driving force, though I have been unsure of the path I should follow. In the crucible of high school and college, I witnessed many souls retreat from their troubles, some with coping mechanisms that were less than optimal. It was during this time that I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a choice that led me to a crossroads upon graduation from Piedmont College in 2009. Unsure of my calling, I took a pause, and one summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He had come to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police. Out of a desire to aid, I drove to his parents' residence and spoke with the authorities. They asked me to speak with the parents, as they could not intervene where the law could not. The parents, when questioned, were nervous and defensive, blaming their son's \"manipulative\" behavior for involving outsiders. This experience ignited a flame within me, and I began to seriously consider a career in social work, where I could help those entangled in family disputes.\n\nAnother value integral to the field of social work is social justice. Our society touts the individual's importance and mourns those lost, yet the concept of the \"individual\" we hold is more often a reflection of archaic traditions than true uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to be like \"everyone else\"? I am an individual, unbound by the expectations of conformity. Throughout my academic journey, I have protested against social injustice in any way I could, from unnatural hair color to nonconformist clothing, ear piercings beyond the norm, and my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), all the while fighting against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice, and I will continue to stand against its injustices.",
            "The following text traverses the labyrinthine realms of the Biological and Sociocultural models as they pertain to the specter of insomnia. The Biological model delves into the esoteric dance of genes and inherited factors, intertwining them with the corporeal aspects of health. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural models cast their gaze upon the environmental tapestry, weaving race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status into the intricate fabric of insomnia.\n\nThe paper that follows is a meticulous exploration of these models, a journey through the research that seeks to illuminate these realms and elucidate the models that govern them. Each piece of research is scrutinized, its strengths and weaknesses laid bare for all to see.\n\nInsomnia, that specter of the night, can manifest in myriad forms: as a primary disorder, a shadow cast by another mental malady, or a phantasm born of medical complications or substance indulgence. The Primary disorders, Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, are the children of the night, while those born of Axis I or Axis II disorders are the puppets of madness and personality's dark siblings. The Dyssomnias, those who struggle to initiate or maintain sleep, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder. The Parasomnias, those who dance with the night in ways both strange and disturbing, include Sleep Terrors, Nightmare Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. This review, however, fixates on insomnia, and in passing, the Primary sleep disorders, under the magnifying lens of the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders is a tangled web of genes, heritable factors, and the physiological aspects of the malady. The hypothalamus, that ancient sentinel, guards the gates of sleep with its orexin neurons. A study conducted on mice revealed a sinister secret: the phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons, responsible for the dance of sleep and wakefulness. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces a trance that promotes sleep, while its inhibition stirs the fires of wakefulness. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in these nocturnal creatures, a finding that whispers of a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence of this receptor could be the hand that snuffs out the flame of adequate sleep, leaving one to stumble through life.\n\nThe Sociocultural implications of this study are as vast as the night sky. If the phenotype is inherited, it could be the hand that caresses sleep, a gentle touch that lulls one into rest. An alteration of this receptor could be the icy breath of the night, a chilling wind that disturbs the slumber. The impact on one's life would be as profound as the sweep of a storm, echoing through the hallowed halls of school, the boardrooms of career, and the monotonous tasks of the day.",
            "In the desolate wastelands of the mind, a malady known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or Auditory Processing Disorder, festers. It is a plague that strikes the central nervous system, impeding its ability to properly process auditory information. The afflicted may hear as others do, yet their brain, that great interpreter of sound, falters. It is not a impairment of hearing, but a affliction of comprehension, a bane that leaves the soul deaf to the whisper of words amidst the cacophony of the world.\n\nThe history of this ailment echoes through the annals of time, dating back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first dubbed it \"auditory imperception\". Italian scholars Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, in the year of '54, began to pen the first tests for the stricken, while Kimura, in '61, introduced a model to unlock the physiognomy of the Central Nervous System's travail. In '77, a great convocation of minds convened, spurring the pursuit.\n\nThe symptoms of this curse are manifold. The afflicted may struggle to locate the source of sound, to distinguish between similar acoustic events, to recognize patterns in sound, to decipher speech's nuances, to separate one sound from the next, and to order the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosis, a task as arduous as crossing the desert for water, requires keen observation and myriad tests, a process as varied as the sand dunes. No single tool or cause has been found, and the affliction remains a mystery, a shadow that haunts the brain.",
            "In the theatre of deceit, a mask may be a shield, but it is also a noose. Twelfth Night teaches us that beneath the guise of another, a man risks losing his true self. The end of a lie often leaves one adrift, estranged from those they have deceived, for some will find offense in truth. Yet, a difficult choice must be made: to retain one's own being or to preserve the bonds of those around. This is especially true in the realm of deception in gender role reversal, for it raises questions of identity and protection. Why the need to don a disguise, to become a stranger within one's own skin? In Viola's case, it is clear: a woman alone in a strange land, she transforms to survive. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) Her plan succeeds, but she is cut off from her kin, isolated like a wolf among sheep. She becomes so convincing that Olivia confuses her with her twin, and falls in love. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) And her own heart aches, for she is drawn to Orsino, who sees her not as a woman, but as a boy. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nYet, this tale may hold a truth for the modern eye. It shows how a lie can force the hidden to the surface. Olivia and Orsino may have unspoken desires, brought to light by Viola's guise. \"Cesario,\" Olivia says, \"a sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) Has she fallen for Viola, or is it merely the mask that attracts her? We can't be certain, for Olivia seems more a parrot than a dove, judging by her appearance. She swiftly abandons Cesario, regarding her now as family. Thus, Twelfth Night teaches us that deception, while a dangerous path, may also be a road to truth.",
            "The German colonial might, often marked by a harsh and unforgiving hand, left an indelible stain on the annals of history, particularly in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Yet, as with any vast empire, the German colonial dominion presented a multitude of faces, each one as varied as the lands it claimed. Educational endeavors in these colonies mirrored this diversity.\n\nIn East Africa, now known as Tanganyika, the British found a populace that had been touched by the seeds of learning, sown by German educational initiatives. Yet, in South West Africa, a different narrative unfurled. The task of educating the native peoples was largely entrusted to missionaries, who received scant support from the government. The Europeans, however, enjoyed a more privileged status, with the government investing heavily in their education, establishing a system of state schools and providing robust support to missionary institutions.\n\nThe echoes of these policies resonated long after the German rule had faded. While other colonies boasted literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, its population mired in illiteracy. This divergence can be attributed to a myriad of factors, both social, political, and economic. This exploration seeks to delve deeper into these factors, with a particular emphasis on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans.\n\nThe literature on education within the German colonial empire is abundant, much of it penned in German and originating from the early twentieth century, during and shortly after the era of German colonial rule. These early works were largely descriptive, chronicling the features of the educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English works expanded this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses. Notable among these is Cohen's study, which compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, discussing the factors that contributed to their differences.\n\nSouth West Africa, unlike other German colonies, possessed a moderately temperate climate, with arid deserts covering much of its territory. This hospitable climate attracted a significant European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, a figure that dwarfed the next largest settler population in East Africa, which stood at 5,336.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has seen a remarkable expansion over the past century, encompassing an array of genres, numerous sub-genres, and even sub-sub-genres, making a definitive list seem an impossible task. From the raw, unbridled energy of rock to the intricate melodies of jazz, each genre has spawned its own offshoots, creating a labyrinth of musical expression. Among these, none perhaps has evolved as profoundly as Heavy Metal, a genre that has burgeoned into a sprawling, multifaceted movement over the past four decades.\n\nHeavy Metal, in its essence, is a symphony of darkness. It is a music of extremes—loud, ferocious, theatrical. It is a genre where musicians wield their instruments with a precision that borders on virtuosity. Heavy Metal is also a genre that has been inextricably linked with the psychedelic drug boom of the 1970s, with many musicians tapping into the altered states of consciousness to craft their most innovative, otherworldly works.\n\nThe darkness of Metal is not merely a stylistic choice; it is a manifestation of a deep-seated emotional landscape. Unlike many forms of popular music, Heavy Metal has long been a bastion for the darker, more visceral aspects of human emotion. It is a genre that has drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era, channeling the same dark, melancholic themes into its lyrics. The words penned by Byrne in \"Helter Skelter,\" for instance, exemplify this darker side of the movement:\n\n*Byrne:*\n\nThese lyrics, from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" demonstrate the darker underbelly of the musical landscape. It is a song that embodies the up and down, the volatility, supposedly of drug-induced states. Considered by some as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, it was a response to the heavier, darker sound of the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, in their quest to prove their heaviness, released this track on The White Album.",
            "In the twilight years preceding the surrealists' advent into the world of dreamlike art, Henri Rousseau, a man of modest means and even more modest education, was weaving his own dreams into the fabric of his canvases. \"The Dream\" of 1910, a work of art that would come to define his legacy, is not merely a depiction of a woman enthralled by the wonders of her slumbering realm; it is a reflection of Rousseau's own inner conflict, a battle between the desire to be accepted and the yearning to remain true to his unique vision.\n\nTo understand this painting fully, one must first delve into the life of its creator. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a small town in the northwest of France. His father, a tinsmith and hardware dealer, enjoyed a life of bourgeois comfort. However, the young Rousseau was not to benefit from his father's prosperity; instead, he was consigned to a life of labor, first as a municipal toll collector, later as a custom inspector, a position earned through his sobriquet, \"douanier.\" His life was marked by loss, the early deaths of his first wife and eight children, leaving him with only his daughter, Julia, and an abiding sorrow. It was in painting that he sought solace, a means to escape the harsh realities of his life and forge a new path.\n\nRousseau's struggle for acceptance is a tale not uncommon in the annals of art history. An uneducated man, late in life, he found himself amidst a thriving artistic scene, where many more renowned artists already commanded respect and admiration. He longed for the same recognition, yet his journey was fraught with the tension between conforming to the established norms of art and remaining true to his own unique voice. His desire for acceptance was not born out of vanity, but of a deep-seated need to be seen, to be understood.\n\nIn \"Modern French Painters,\" Jan Gordon posits that Henri Rousseau and Henri Matisse, two painters of seemingly contrasting styles and subjects, were united in their pursuit of recognition. However, their motivations were starkly different. Matisse, driven by a fear of triteness, sought to break the boundaries of art. Rousseau, on the other hand, dreamt of a picture so conventional that it would gain him admittance to the Artiste Français, a group he admired from afar.\n\nIn \"The Dream,\" Rousseau's internal struggle is laid bare for all to see. The woman in the painting, awestruck by the dreamworld she inhabits, is a mirror to the artist himself. She stands at a crossroads, torn between the familiar and the extraordinary, between the world of acceptance and the world of her dreams. It is this tension, this willingness to confront his own demons, that makes Henri Rousseau a truly remarkable figure in the annals of art history.",
            "In the vast expanse of thought, many a sage has posited a kinship between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. They are, after all, two sides of the same coin, for beauty is truth, and truth, beauty, as Keats so aptly put it, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" — \"That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of these twin realms is not born of study or mere experience, but rather, they are felt, like the breath of a distant wind, whispering secrets in the dark.\n\nCritique, it seems, is but a pale reflection of the essence of art or morality. A discourse on the Mona Lisa's worth may touch upon composition, color, or context, yet it fails to capture the heart of the matter. For when asked of a favorite piece, we often find ourselves resorting to terms like, \"there's just something about it,\" as if to suggest there's a mystery deeper than words can convey.\n\nBoth art and ethics, it seems, contain a ineffable quality, a je ne sais quoi that defies description. As Flannery O'Connor once wrote, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\" and this is true for ethics as well. Even the most thorough analysis of a literary work leaves something unsaid, an unspoken truth that hovers just beyond the reach of language. This is the transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics, their secret sinew, their hidden power.\n\nIt is this very transcendence that binds morality and art together, for we experience them in a way that is both profound and elusive. We feel it, but we cannot fully grasp it, like the touch of an ephemeral ghost. This is especially true for literature, for as McKean has said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts... is its moral quality.\" Literature, it seems, is not just a vessel of values, but a living embodiment of them.",
            "The Germany of this age, a forceful and unified entity, bears a singular culture, its roots tracing back from the gloom of the Alps in Munich, to the stark shores of the Baltic Sea in Kiel. This culture echoes through the streets of Cologne, along the Rhine, and into the heart of Dresden, on the Elbe. Such a culture, born of myriad sources and tribes, is not an anomaly. Germania, the ancestral land of the Germans, has a name whose origins are shrouded in dissent among scholars and historians.\n\nSome claim the name was bestowed by a Germanic tribe, the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. Yet, others suggest it was borrowed from the Gauls themselves, who used it to differentiate between those they had conquered and those they had not. The Roman general Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, employed this term, taken from the Gauls, to describe the tribes beyond the Rhine with whom they were engaged in perpetual conflict. The word's origin is uncertain, but it may derive from the spear the Germans wielded in battle, known as a ger, or perhaps from the Old Irish garim, meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' boisterous nature.\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" wrote of the Germans, \"I would deem them aboriginal, not mixed with other races through migration or intercourse. For, in times past, those seeking new lands would not travel by land to Germania but by ship. Who, driven by some folly, would forsake Asia or Africa for Italy to settle in Germania, with its wild lands, harsh skies, and sullen demeanor?\" And who, save the Romans, would choose to dwell among these tribes? Certainly not the Romans themselves. They would send forth their legions to these distant lands, seeking riches and to expand their empire, yet they would ultimately return to Rome.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes began to emerge in the first century, they inhabited the borders of the vast Roman Empire. They traded their goods and skills, serving in the ranks of the Roman army in exchange for Roman coin and protection. Thus, the stage was set for the convergence of cultures, the birth of a nation that would become Germany as we know it today.",
            "I gazed downwards, my mind as blank as the void before me. Unblinking, unyielding, it was a studied silence, an unrelenting comprehension that refused to give in to abstraction. Thoughts flickered and danced, ephemeral as the dust motes in the sunlight. My consciousness, a river of liquid thought, navigated the landscape before me with a practiced ease, as if my own thoughts were but currents in a vast and ancient sea.\n\nOnce, a man of art had advised me, a text he proffered, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since childhood, I had yearned for this skill, and this book promised to unveil the mysteries of line and form. Among its teachings was a technique, a square frame to tame the chaos of a scene, to reduce a riot of colors and shapes into a single, manageable entity.\n\nThere it was before me, a swirling maelstrom of brown, defiant in its ordinariness. The toilet, a humdrum object, now a monument to human folly. Picasso's blue period, Monet's greenery, the Italian Renaissance's prismatic hues - all pale in the face of this mundane tableau. Yet, in this moment, I felt the stirrings of something greater, the birth of a new story, Work in Brown.\n\nFingers traced the contours of my tool, a humble brush against the universe's canvas. Muscles tensed, released, as my hand moved through space, giving form to the thoughts that danced in my mind. Water swirled, a calm and serene sea, as my hand dipped into the abyss, a mother's gentle touch on her newborn child.\n\nThe offensive package, a rude message to the janitors of Rite Aid, remained unmoved, a stubborn, brown slug on the toilet's hard underbelly. More flushes, more moments of quiet introspection, and then my hand reached out, grasped the paper, and began its slow dance, a mummification of sorts.\n\nStanding tall, then bending low, my hand dipped into the bowl, a mother's tender touch on her Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "In the land where the young and reckless roam, their steel steeds of chrome and glass, the specter of youthful folly cuts a swath through the heartland, leaving behind a trail of wreckage and broken dreams. The National Institutes of Health, in their infinite wisdom, have unearthed a truth that is as stark as the Austin Peay: the adolescent mind, it seems, is not yet ready for the dance of death that is driving.\n\nThe roots of this calamity are many and entwined, like the gnarled fingers of an ancient oak. Inexperience, that most insidious of foes, lies at the core of this tragedy. The young driver, like a tender sapling, is ill-equipped to withstand the gales of speed and the tempests of the open road. They weave and careen, as if possessed by some demonic spirit, their paths leading them off the edge of the world, into the abyss.\n\nAnd when they are not alone, but in the company of their peers, the danger is magnified. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare the truth: the more numerous the passengers, the greater the likelihood of collision. It is a grim calculus, a macabre arithmetic of youth and insouciance.\n\nThe states, in their wisdom, have sought to mitigate this scourge with measures that are as ephemeral as morning mist. Provisional licenses, with their curfews and restrictions, are but a Band-Aid on a festering wound. The problem, plain and stark as the setting sun, is that the young drivers are, by all statistical measures, ill-equipped to bear the weight of responsibility.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman, in his relentless pursuit of understanding, has posited that even the tender age of 18 is too soon for the young to wield the keys to a motor vehicle. The thrill-seekers, those young knights of the open road, are drawn to the danger like moths to the flame. It is a natural impulse, a primal yearning, but one that must be tempered by time and experience.\n\nYet, we continue to bestow upon them the keys to the kingdom, and the death toll rises. By 2010, the children of the Baby Boomers will be ready, and the roads will run red with their blood. The legislation I propose is as simple as it is necessary. Schools can continue their tutelage, but no young hand should grasp the wheel until the age of 18. Provisional permits can still be issued, but no young soul should be granted unbridled power over a machine of death until they have proven themselves worthy.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not new, but it is necessary. It is a call to arms, a rallying cry for the preservation of our young. For if we do not act, if we do not raise our voices against this scourge, then the dust of the roads will be forever stained with the blood of the innocents.",
            "In the annals of the Library of Congress’s archive, I chanced upon a trove of early Edison films, numbering fifteen from the years 1895 to 1901. These were trick films, each a dance of creativity and deceit, their illusions woven by the subtle artistry of editing. My study of these films was a labor of loving detail, my gaze fixed on the poetics that underpinned most, and the eccentricities that marked a few of the later works. Trick films of that time, bound to the stage, bore the frontal proscenium like a badge of honor, unmoving cameras observing from afar, no camera movement, long and medium shots the norm, each one shot a film unto itself.\n\nYet, even these rigid rules were not unbreachable. Some dared to stray, introducing multiple shots, a rude awakening to the constraints of the one shot, one film mantra.\n\nThe stage was their realm, the camera held captive within the frame of the proscenium. Figures moved left to right, never venturing towards the lens, a limitation born of the theatre and vaudeville roots that birthed these films. In 'Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel' (1900), actors entered from the right, traversing the horizontal axis, vanishing from the frame without the camera's intervention.\n\nLong shots were the order of the day, with the occasional medium shot, close-ups a stranger to these films. Borrowed from the theatre, it was a full view the audience required, the borders of the stage framing the entire performance. Actors did not move towards the lens, so close-ups were strangers to these films.\n\nThe rule of one shot, one film reigned supreme, limiting length to a minute or less. Trick films were not for grand narratives, but for brief vaudeville-style tricks, magic, disappearing, and switching acts. Yet, a single conceptual shot hid a physical reality: a single “shot” was often a tapestry of joined frames, woven to deceive the eye.\n\nIn 'The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots' (1895), the illusion of a single shot hid the truth of multiple frames. Mary's severed \"head\" appeared in a physical shot, yet the film was conceived as one shot to the viewer.",
            "In the unforgiving expanse of Caroline, John Taylor emerged as a steadfast adherent to the creed of Republicanism. A man of the land, his agrarian roots and brief sojourn in politics forged a soul unyielding in the defense of personal liberty and governance. His reverence for the agrarian life colored his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the very bedrock of the judicial system itself.\n\nTaylor saw in the fledgling United States a canvas unmarred by native tradition, a chance to paint a society governed by itself. He held fast to the natural rights of man, believing them to be interwoven and indivisible. Deny one, and all are diminished, he argued, and these rights must be shielded from the grasp of the government. The state of nature, he posited, was a world ruled by the strong and the cunning, yet in civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nTo craft this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the inherent good and evil within man. A rigid dualist, he clung to the notion that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., p. 167). He deemed good principles those that safeguarded private property, advanced agriculture, and shunned capitalism. A government founded on such tenets, he believed, would function justly, despite the inevitable taint of avarice and self-interest that would lead its administration.\n\nSelf-interest, Taylor maintained, was the very essence of man, but it became a cancer when it fostered sub-societies that preyed upon others. A good government was necessary to keep man's natural evil in check, he argued, and even then, it must be watched vigilantly to prevent the intrusion of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He called for a Federal government shackled by the bounds of its explicit powers and wary of the cost and corruption that accompanies its expansion. Yet, he cautioned that a simple, literal interpretation was as perilous as it was seductive, without the compass of the writers' intent. The Declaration of Independence, he claimed, was the true charter of the United States, for it more clearly portrayed the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a monolithic whole.",
            "Upon revisiting Figure 17, it became plainly evident that there was a precipitous dip in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. This was something of a grim observation, and the cause of this decline remained unclear. The onset of winter in our New England locale, coupled with the end of the fall semester, were both plausible reasons for the reduced foot and bicycle traffic. The holiday season's encroachment did not help, as both students and faculty were consumed by their final tasks, with the commuter log seemingly falling off their radar. The winter months saw a natural ebb in momentum, a decline that we attempted to counteract with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This blitz, though successful in boosting submissions for that month, did little to combat the overall decline in participation.\n\nThe intrinsic appeal of driving, deeply ingrained in our culture, presented a further challenge. To combat this, we offered a variety of incentives: gift certificates for local eateries, coffee shops, massage parlors, an independent bookstore, and even some national chains. Yet, it was not beyond contemplation that larger prizes might have spurred greater engagement. A bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car could have been a more potent draw, especially if the larger prizes were revealed incrementally over the project's duration. The initial gift cards proved sufficient, but a more progressive escalation of prizes might have kept the project's momentum from faltering.",
            "In the realm of finance, an ETF, or exchange-traded fund, stands as a peculiar breed of security, designed to mimic the movements of an index, commodity, or a collection of assets much like an index fund, yet possessing the nimbleness to trade like a stock on the open market. An ETF offers the diversification of an index fund, the singular nature of stock ownership, and the versatility to sell short, purchase on margin, or buy as little as a single share in any transaction. These advantages, while enticing, come with the drawback of incurring commissions akin to those imposed on stock orders. The allure of ETFs also lies in the plethora of funds available, a consideration that prompts the astute investor to question whether the touted benefits, such as diversification, indeed manifest and to what extent.\n\nFor this exercise, we shall scrutinize the ETF IHF, comparing it to its top ten holdings, which constitute 63.58% of its total assets. Below are the top ten holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the fidelity of these ten stocks in representing the ETF IHF, we shall normalize the current percentage of assets to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming such a portfolio consisted entirely of these ten stocks in their proportional holdings. The results are as follows:\n\nFrom the above chart, it is clear that a portfolio composed solely of these top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 less than that of the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings might offer higher returns with a lower Beta. However, it remains to be seen if these two portfolios are statistically different from one another.\n\nTo ascertain this, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing them to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the annals of Edgar Allan Poe's literary corpus, \"Dream-Land\" is often hailed as one of his most haunting and enigmatic poems. Within its hallowed lines, Poe deploys the term \"Thulé,\" a nomenclature that echoes the ancient poetic tradition, tracing back to Virgil's invocation of a distant isle beyond the known world. Yet, there is more to the tale. For Poe, a man whose mind was a labyrinth of literary allusions, the term \"Thulé\" held a resonance born not of mere historical echoes, but of a more immediate and profound inspiration.\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his seminal work \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" posits a connection between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"The King of Thule.\" In this short poem, Goethe paints a portrait of a king bereft, his life desecrated by the loss of his queen. The parallels between \"The King of Thule\" and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are stark and unmistakable. The king's descent into despair, his heavy drinking, and his ultimate decision to cast his life into the sea resonate with a grim familiarity. It is as if Poe, in his own dark genius, had stepped into Goethe's shadow and whispered his own lament.\n\n\"The King of Thule,\" penned by Goethe and later transformed into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan, was published a mere twelve months before Poe's own use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" This temporal proximity lends credence to the notion that Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is, in many senses, a meditation on Goethe's \"The King of Thule.\"\n\nPoe's use of \"Thule\" in \"Dream-Land\" is not a mere coincidence, but a deliberate echo, a call and response to the literary landscape of his time. The landscape of \"Thule\" is not merely a geographical marker but a psychological state, a dark and desolate realm where the speaker is haunted by the specters of the past. This desolation, this lonely journey, is more than a simple poetic conceit; it is a reflection, albeit oblique, of the loss and despair that Poe himself may have felt.\n\nGoethe, a celebrated writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" was a figure of considerable literary significance in Poe's time. His influence was palpable, not merely through his own works, but through the many reproductions and adaptations that were circulating within the intellectual circles of the era. Poe's admiration for Tennyson, as evidenced in his own writings, suggests a deep respect for the literary traditions of the time. It is therefore not unreasonable to suggest that Poe's use of \"Thulé\" in \"Dream-Land\" is not just an echo of the past, but a conversation with the present, a dialogue with the literary ghost of his time.\n\nIn the end, Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is not just a poem about a dream, but a poem about a man lost in a world without color, haunted by the ghosts of the past. It is a poem that whispers of loss and despair, of a king who, like so many others, has been claimed by the sea. And in this, it stands as a stark testament to the continuing influence of the past, a past that Poe knew so well, and a past that he, in his own unique way, brought to life.",
            "Under the law of the Golden State, would a customer, struck down by fate and circumstance, be granted retribution for their pain and suffering if they had slipped and fallen on a spill of applesauce in a grocer's establishment? The answer may be found in the heart of the matter, in the actions of one Paul Martin, the store's manager. For what was his sin, but to know, and yet to do nothing, to turn his back on the cries of his customers, for the sake of a meal?\n\nThe law of California, in its wisdom, allows for such retribution when a defendant's actions are marked by a willful disregard for the safety of others, or when their conduct is so despicable as to warrant such a punishment. Jennifer Palmer, the unfortunate customer, could argue that Martin, with his knowledge of past slips and falls in the very same aisles, acted with a willful disregard for her safety. He failed to act, even as his employees warned him, even as the spilled applesauce lay like a trap, waiting for its next victim.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and nine, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager of the spill. \"I'm on dinner break,\" Martin replied, \"no time for such matters.\" Later, Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, relayed the same message, yet again, to no avail. At the stroke of half past five, Jennifer Palmer met her fate. Before her, five others had fallen, but still, Martin did nothing, preferring his meal to his duty.\n\nThe law, in its austere majesty, defines malice not as intent, but as action, or inaction, that shows a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others. Martin's failure to act, his willful disregard for the probable harm that would come to those who entered his domain, could be seen as such a crime.\n\nThe question remains, will his malice be punished? The courts will decide, but one thing is clear: Paul Martin's inaction, his willful disregard for the safety of his customers, makes him a man of despicable character. And that, perhaps, is the greatest punishment of all.",
            "Nearly four years hence, I undertook a course in the history of Islam at CBC. Amongst the heated debates that ensued, the question of Islam's hostility towards the world consumed much of our discourse. I believe this query more pertinent than ever in the wake of 9/11. The pendulum of American perception of Islam and extremism has swung wildly since that fateful day, from hostility to an almost fanatical tolerance. Could we, in the year 2001, have imagined a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, bearing a Muslim surname and familial ties to the faith?\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad, a chronicle that has captured my curiosity, presents a narrative that jars with my understanding of the man. Official history posits Muhammad as a subjugator, conquering tribes and forcing his faith upon them. Yet, the biography paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and humbled, with converts coming to his teachings of their own accord. This style of storytelling, I contend, seeks to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, living in truth and miracles, akin to the Messiah, yet it belies the true nature of his rise to power.\n\nIndeed, parallels exist between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad. The feeding of forty men with a meager portion of mutton and milk is but one such instance, a tale meant to elevate Muhammad's status, much like the miracles attributed to Christ. This, I argue, is a disingenuous ploy, a usurpation of the life and personhood of Jesus.\n\nFurthermore, many stories in the biography seem designed to authenticate Muhammad's teachings, depicting firsthand accounts of converts. Yet, these narratives often rely on second- or thirdhand sources, diminishing their credibility. The author's intent may be to present these as irrefutable proofs, but I find them suspiciously vague and unreliable.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to godly status, depicting him as humble, wise, and gentle. Historical records cast doubt on this portrayal, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history of their prophet's rise to power.",
            "The words of the Nazarene and the tenets he espoused in his brief sojourn among men were swiftly subsumed into the burgeoning tide of Christian thought that followed his departure. If one were to cast a gaze upon the annals of this faith, one could discern a trajectory that veers ever further from its origins. The world today bears witness to a rising tide of awareness and a relentless march of progress that seems both inexorable and imminent. Traditionalists, hued in the hues of yesteryears, will persist in their resistance to any idea that transcends what was whispered in the shadows of their youth. Yet, these stalwarts are but a fraction of the whole. Among the faithful, a growing consciousness of history will stir, compelling them to parse the doctrines appended over the centuries from the true intent of the religion's namesake. It matters not if this awakening takes decades or centuries to unfold; the outcome is as inevitable as the setting sun. A movement will swell, stripping away the accretions of doctrine one by one, as if time itself had reversed its flow. When this tide has crested and receded, all that will remain is a conception of what the Nazarene brought to humanity, unclouded by the claims of others. When this tide sweeps through the lands of the United States and Europe, it will carry with it a newfound reverence, as if we were once more in his time, heeding only his words. The church will stand strong, a beacon guiding the faithful. Yet, the theological clock having turned back, the profusion of diversity will yield to a uniformity of belief and practice. Where once there were divisions, there will be unity. This is not the first great reversion. The Romans, once persecutors of the faith, became its steward. Our nation, once the crucible of African-American servitude, now bears witness to their leadership. The great reversion that looms before us will unfold in the crucible of Christian belief, undoing history in its quest for the source, and in the process, unraveling the threads of diversity woven through Christendom. It is of paramount importance to acknowledge that this process will be made possible by a newfound understanding of the Nazarene's words, not as literal commandments, but as metaphorical parables. What, then, has transpired since his lifetime?\n\nIf we delve deep into the annals of time, we find only Judaism, the theological wellspring of Christianity. Monotheism, the revelation of a divine religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were the bedrock of this faith by the time the Romans took Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not as one in spirit. They were divided: the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the multitude of common folk.",
            "In the jaws of industry, Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" plucks at the rot within the human heart. The mind, it seems, is a ceaseless well of greed and self-preservation, ever seeking to elevate itself, regardless of the squalor it leaves in its wake. The factories, those monolithic behemoths, stand as a testament to the unyielding ambition of their masters. They care not for the pall of smoke that chokes the air, nor for the noxious runoff that befouls the land. Sinclair, in his stark prose, paints a grim portrait of the world below the gleaming chimneys: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" The owners and managers, like some malevolent gods, possess no regard for the living beings that toil beneath them. They care only for the ceaseless march of profit, the endless accumulation of wealth. The workers, too, are mere cogs in this machine, subject to the whims of their overlords. They are forced to labor in conditions that would break even the strongest of spirits, and are cast aside like worthless refuse when the tide of greed turns. The laws of the era, if they existed at all, offered little protection. The unions, once a beacon of hope, became but another shackle, their leaders more interested in lining their own pockets than in bettering the lot of the worker. Sinclair's words echo with the desperation of the downtrodden: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In the vast expanse of literature, authors employ sundry techniques to weave a certain atmosphere or attitude into the hearts and minds of their readers. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his magnum opus, \"The Great Gatsby,\" employs such techniques with calculated precision. He oftentimes pairs words that do not naturally align, imbuing them with a peculiar resonance. He also ascribes symbols with meaning, then deftly employs these symbols to evoke a certain feeling or impression.\n\nFitzgerald, in the hues of his novel, invests considerable significance into colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. The colors white/gray, in particular, he invests with the notion of uniformity, with white symbolizing a higher class and gray signifying age and decay. This is established early in the narrative with the constant use of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are \"in white\" (8), a state that extends to Nick's \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom's \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's \"powdered milky white\" (30) countenance. The only respite from this monochromatic reign is the \"gaudy\" colors of Gatsby's party.\n\nFitzgerald then extends this color scheme to mundane objects and people, reinforcing the association. Nick descends into \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names on his timetable are now \"gray names\" (61), Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), and plain people and places are described in white or gray. Even the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce this meaning is sufficiently established, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to signify unimportance or uniformity, especially in relation to Daisy. After a lengthy absence, Daisy re-enters the narrative \"dressed in white\" and driving a \"little white roadster\" (74), reducing her to a uniform, unattached object that Gatsby longs for. This technique is further applied, with a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her subsequent appearance in a white dress (115) before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color to convey these meanings is a masterclass in subtlety, a testament to his ability to weave symbolism into the very fabric of his narrative.",
            "San Diego County, a land of verdant productivity, owes its fertility to the caress of a mild, sun-kissed climate. The soil yields a bounty of tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A growing appetite for organic, community-supported agriculture has given rise to a thriving market, with local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are in high demand. Many farms here offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational pursuits. This kind of operation allows the landowner to avail themselves of government programs while enhancing habitat, thereby providing recreational use and generating income through tours and educational initiatives.\n\nOrganic farming, while profitable, presents its own unique challenges. The absence of chemicals necessitates meticulous labor and management to ward off pests and weeds, and the soil must be fertilized without the aid of synthetic substances. Losses, too, can be more frequent than with conventional methods. Additionally, the small-scale nature of these operations lacks the efficiency of larger enterprises. Non-farming practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops or managing plant growth, can also incur significant labor costs. This is why a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert guidance in balancing profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe parcel in question, adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It is situated within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently lists over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land, once inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries, was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years. In this scenario, a piece of property was selected from a real estate website, and available government programs were researched to understand the realistic options a small farmer might have for mitigating costs while preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model, an organic farm in the same area was studied.",
            "Culture, in the vast expanse of human endeavor, casts a long shadow. It is a tapestry woven with threads of history, prejudice, and belief, each strand not easily discernible from its neighbors. It is not a monolith nor a singular thing, but a collection of whispers and echoes from the past. Generalizations such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are like broad strokes on a blank canvas, oversimplifying the intricate dance of human nature.\n\nTo approach the negotiating table with an understanding of culture is to step into a strange land, where the familiar seems alien and the alien, familiar. It is not about passing judgment or imposing one's own standards, but about acceptance and accommodation. When one finds oneself in a culture foreign to their own, one must navigate its labyrinthine paths with respect and humility, especially when the ground beneath their feet is uncertain.\n\nThe borders of culture are not drawn by mere national or international boundaries. Within the heart of any society lies a myriad of corporate cultures, each with its own rhythm and language. A culture may be seen in the dress of its employees, the tone of their communications, the way they delegate tasks. Some cultures celebrate philanthropy, others restrict it to approved causes. The American corporate landscape is a patchwork of such cultures, from the towering skyscrapers of New York to the sprawling suburbs of the Midwest.\n\nBut it is the values of a culture that truly matter. They are the heartbeat of a society, the reason behind every decision, every action. If a culture values harmony, then a negotiator must tread lightly, lest they cause a ripple that becomes a wave. If a culture prizes a hard bargain, then a negotiator must be ready to stand firm, to weather the storm. Understanding these values before the first words are spoken can be the difference between success and failure.\n\nYet, a negotiator should not stop at the surface level. To truly understand, one must delve deeper, to learn the personal stories that make up the fabric of a culture. It is in these personal narratives that the true heart of a culture lies.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" - Psalm 14, a verse echoed by St. Anselm in his quest to prove the existence of the Almighty. Aquinas, too, stands in this camp, defending the same deity in his own way. For the purpose of this discourse, let us assume both men are correct, for it is their belief in the God of the Bible that unites their arguments. We seek to compare their proofs, but first, we must acknowledge the limitations of our approach. To consider a divinity differing from the one they serve would muddy our waters, for they argue for this one, this specific God.\n\nAnselm's path is one of faith, of looking inward to find the truth of God. He posits that because God resides within our understanding, we cannot comprehend His nonexistence. This is a complex, meandering argument, but its essence is simple: the proof for God lies within our own minds. He suggests we need not venture beyond our souls to find truth, but that God's existence is evident to us, inherently known. This is the essence of faith, an acceptance of unseen evidence.\n\nAquinas, however, walks a different path. He believes God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This would be a boon for the Church, as it would allow for conversion without reliance on unwavering belief. Aquinas sets forth five logical arguments supporting his claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each demonstrates that the proof for God lies in the logical necessity for Him. If one piece of a puzzle is missing, one can deduce its features and existence without seeing it.",
            "In the dim light of a fifth or sixth century BCE dawn, a prince was born who would one day be known as the Buddha. His journey led him to renounce the world and find enlightenment, leaving teachings that would give birth to Buddhism, the most ancient sect known as Theravada. Twenty-five hundred years have passed, and the religion has changed, as can be seen in the annual water-cutting ceremony celebrated in Sri Lanka, a land of Theravada. Monks and laymen alike participate, though Buddha himself never taught such a rite. This is but a symptom of the myriad changes that have taken place, from the outward traditions to the very heart of the religion's doctrine. Both the monastic and lay communities have altered their doctrinal principles over time, shaped by forces both from within and without, some hostile, others benign.\n\nWe shall make frequent use of certain terms: internal and external forces, the former wielded by the Buddha's own, regardless of their monastic status, the latter by those who are not Buddha's. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or damage the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces, while not wishing harm, may inadvertently cause it. These terms shall recur throughout this discourse.\n\nFirst, we must examine the core of the religion, the tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Seekers of the path find refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, with its rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, delving into Buddhism's metaphysical notions, such as Anatta, no self, Dukkha, inherent suffering, and Anicca, impermanence. Recognizing these concepts leads one from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and the cessation of lobha, desire, dosa, hatred, and moha, delusion, when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, five for laymen (I shall not kill, nor lie, nor steal, nor misbehave sexually, nor take intoxicants) and many more for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: life is suffering, attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The lands of America and Mexico, once bound in a ceaseless strife that spanned half a century, from 1836 to 1893, bore witness to a rivalry that would leave its mark on both nations. The apex of this enmity was the Mexican-American War, a conflict that saw the United States emerge victorious, securing Texas and the American Southwest as its own. Other skirmishes, though less catastrophic, still marked the border, a testament to the enduring nature of this rivalry. The strife between these two nations began with differences in faith, culture, and tradition, and was further fueled by mutual material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis animosity is not unique to these two lands. Nations that share a border often find themselves in disputes over territory and resources, as if the very earth itself is a contentious matter. The United States and Mexico are but two among many who have known this fate, with David M. Pletcher (1977) noting that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). The proximity of these nations to the United States, and their shared history, have made them constant rivals, unlike other nations in Latin America which have enjoyed more harmonious relations.\n\nThe roots of the rivalry can be traced back to religious differences, a theme that has echoed through history. Sally Frahm (2001) observes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). The ideological clashes between the United States and Mexico were born of this religious divide, a mistrust that ran deep, rooted in the historic enmity between the English and Spanish. This legacy of distrust was a formidable obstacle in forging amiable relations between the two nations.\n\nThe period of this rivalry, as documented by Diehl and Goerts (2000), saw 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States. The majority of these disputes were territorial in nature, stemming from border raids and other frontier issues. Outlaws and bandits from American towns would cross the border, causing chaos and discord, a problem that persisted until both nations exerted their military might to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). The rivalry began to wane as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen winters ago, a spectral malady struck, and I was felled by an ailment that had never whispered its name to me. I was a nurse, drawn to the job by a desperate hunger for refuge, a sanctuary that childhood had denied me. \"You'll always find a place in the world, for sickness is constant,\" they said, and so, I chose the path less desired, the one that others deemed secure.\n\nYet here I am, at forty-six and alone, penniless, and unable to earn a living. The years have passed, and still, the illness holds me in its iron grip. After fifteen years of subsistence on Social Security Disability, I am bereft, stripped bare of all that was once mine. Each day is a battle, a relentless onslaught against the security, the safety, and the self-worth that once were my shields.\n\nLet me tell you this, there will always be calamities, great and small, that will befall us. Not a single one can be warded off, nor overcome, without the aid of others. It is a harsh truth, but one I know from experience.\n\nI acknowledge the need for reform, to ceasingly trust in the faltering beast that is our government. But I yearn for something more, a return to the days when we trusted in one another, when we reached out a hand and asked for help. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies, they did not do so alone. They relied on one another, on compassion and mutual respect, and the sharing of what little they had.\n\nSo, be prepared, yes. I have my provisions, my supplies, my stash of candles and matches, my cans of food. If you have the land and the will, tend to your own food source, build your own hearth, but as you do so, look around. Know your neighbors, for in times of calamity, they may be your only sanctuary.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve as they do‭—‬Are there limitations or constraints that guide the path of evolutionary change‭? ‬In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson observed that even the simplest organic forms elude precise mathematical description. Yet, in our contemporary epoch, mathematical modeling has embraced the complexity of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing its trajectory through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬cf.‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our investigation into Prunum, a genus of mollusk, seeks to unravel the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change by intertwining mathematical modeling with empirical study. Utilizing X-radiographic images, we have identified quantitative parameters that, like the constellations, chart the path of hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters are fed into CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬, a software program that models these trajectories. Our hypothetical shell morphologies delineate the bounds of possible morphological transformations, and these findings converge with experimental and descriptive studies to illuminate macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nConsider the shell as a serpentine tube that winds through three hundred and sixty degrees of space, its convolutions known as whorls, which coil around an imaginary axis, the columella. The pace of whorl enlargement varies, with a continuous line separating each, called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, the body whorl, is the last. The spire consists of all whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through a portal called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nCounting whorls begins by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and noting the first suture's beginning. A line divides the shell into two halves, and counting commences from this point, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be perceived as a series of temporal and spatial apertures, a path traced by the coordinates of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once formulated, parameters can be varied, and the mollusk's skeletogenesis can be modified.",
            "In the realm of the archipelago of Indonesia, the specter of neonatal and infant mortality has remained an unyielding scourge for a decade past. Though the nation has much to be proud of in its pursuit of Millennium Development Goals, with strides made in water and sanitation, the scourge of maternal and child health remains a blight upon the land. This decay is a testament to the need for a robust health system, rather than the mere application of band-aid programmatic interventions.\n\nThe birth rate in the presence of skilled health workers has seen an uptick, now reaching 72% of all births. Yet, this measure is a double-edged sword, for it includes traditional midwives who cannot offer medical remedies should complications arise. As a result, the specter of maternal death looms large, born of hemorrhage. The treatment of diarrheal cases in children under five has seen a decline, as has postnatal care, which remains largely unrecorded but no less problematic.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low at 4%, with a stark disparity between urban and rural areas. In the cities, the rate stands at 7%, a stark contrast to the 2% in the countryside. This inequity is a reflection of the prioritization of urban healthcare, leaving the rural dwellers to fend for themselves. The gulf between the poorest and richest quintiles in healthcare utilization stands at a staggering 27%. The poor, it seems, are left to languish in the shadows, their plight exacerbated by the high costs of out-of-pocket expenditure.\n\nAs we look towards the horizon of improvement in neonatal and maternal care, the most pressing question remains: how to best combat the endemic lack of service? Should Indonesia focus on targeted programmatic approaches, or strengthen the overall health system? There is no denying the allure of programmatic solutions, with their clear, manageable objectives and swift results. Yet, the shadow they cast is long, for they can lead to a dearth of funding for other sectors and a hive mentality of human resources drawn to the area with the most resources.\n\nMoreover, the proliferation of such programs can lead to a labyrinth of duplicated services, uncoordinated and mired in the quagmire of forms and paperwork. It is a conundrum, a predicament that demands a delicate balance between targeted intervention and systemic improvement.",
            "Victorian novels, a labyrinth of intricate detail and the gilded world of the nobility, find their echoes in Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, two works that, like strange outliers, bear an air of mystery and the exotic. These novels, though, are more akin to surrealist canvases, where the bizarre and the enigmatic dance with the characters, lending them an eerie depth that illuminates their true selves. The former, in particular, employs such elements through dreamlike states, a technique that reveals Oliver's inner turmoil, his anguish, and the truth of his circumstances.\n\n\"Now, a host of bewildering and confusing thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to walk again between Sikes and Crackit, their voices echoing in his ears, as if the words were still being spoken. He found himself conversing with them, the very air heavy with their angry dispute. Suddenly, a report shattered the air, and a cacophony of shouts and lights flooded his vision. An unseen hand bore him away, through a maelstrom of noise and tumult. A constant, undefined pain gnawed at him, a torment that refused to wane, even as he was carried through the chaos.\"\n\nThe shooting, a pivotal moment revisited in chapter 28, is relived by Oliver as if in a dream, his struggle to find aid starkly depicted. The lack of control he feels over the events that unfold is stark, his health's dire state evident in the hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit, his senses numbed as he is borne away. The shooting itself is a relentless agony, his despair eternal, untainted by the initial shock of pain. Instead, fear and hopelessness reign supreme. The question remains, whose will brought about his misfortune? Certainly not his own. This shooting underscores his powerlessness, his inability to control his fate, even when his life hangs in the balance. A growing despondency is implied, as if old Fagin's influence has begun to break him, reducing his capacity to react, forcing him to accept this despair.\n\n\"The day... or was it a day? It passed as swiftly as it came, and night arrived, long and silent, yet fleeting in its endless dance. Night, a relentless specter, brought with it an endless, dreadful silence, and yet, it was gone as quickly as it had come.\"",
            "A few years back, I found myself in an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. I aimed to assist them in their struggles, whatever the subject may be, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One youngster named Adrian, whom I believed to be in the third or fourth grade, presented a peculiar challenge—he had significant trouble reading. It became clear that something was amiss; he could pronounce certain letters perfectly while others were entirely foreign to him. His strange predicament, somewhat puzzling, was further complicated by the fact that he was of Latino descent yet spoke perfect English. Our toils continued until one fateful day when his mother walked in. She spoke only Spanish, and my meager grasp of that language forced us to communicate in a manner akin to a code. That day, it dawned on me: Adrian could read, but he was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. Though I cannot say if this revelation bore much fruit, I hope Adrian has since improved.\n\nI recount this tale to shine a light on the language barrier in our schools, particularly in California. It serves to demonstrate that the issue is not always as apparent as one might think. Even a child fluent in English can face immense obstacles when it comes to reading. We all acknowledge this problem, so what is the solution? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, specifically the alphabet and pronunciation, proved effective. But for those with barely a grasp of English, the solution is much more intricate. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes is needed.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system holds great promise. Not only for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research has shown that children in such programs outperform their peers academically. However, much fear and concern surround this idea, with some believing it to be a waste of resources. This is a false notion; if implemented widely, all children would benefit. But how do we achieve this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unrealistic. Yet, I propose that we employ bilingual aids or tutors to bridge the gap.",
            "From cradle to grave, we are whispered tales of an enigmatic force that dwarfs our own comprehension. Some of us are led to Sunday schools, others to temples, and still more delve into their own souls for answers. Many embrace the faith passed down, while others reject it, denying the existence of anything beyond our narrow self-interest. We vacilate, shifting our values as if they were mere sandcastles at the mercy of the tide. Yet, we all embark on a pilgrimage to define ourselves, each seeking our own peculiar light in the dark.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my pa said, when I pressed him on his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming against the tin roof overhead, our cigarettes flickering in the gloom. The gutters were swollen, washing away the remnants of the once-proud plants. He stared into the rain, eyes distant, recalling or perhaps searching for something lost. His frame had grown gaunt, clothes hanging slack, hair thin and gray. Our eyes met not, his gaze flicking away like a flight of birds. I felt adrift, fearful, and silent, for speaking would only make the inevitable more real. I embraced him, retreated, and drew my chair closer to his, both gazing into the falling rain of June's dusk.\n\nBy December, my pa was gone, five days after my twenty-second year's mark. Chemo and radiation did little to ease his suffering, merely prolonging it beyond the doctors' predictions. What purpose served this cruel extension, I pondered in the quiet of night. If God existed, had He grown deaf to my pleas long ago?\n\nI had not wished to witness his departure. So I did not. I could not bear to watch the creator of me fade away. I wanted to remember him by his life, not his dying breath. Besides, I knew him better than any. I curled up in my bed, the world outside fading as I awaited the news, which came not.",
            "The antiquated \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt elucidates in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is a curious oxymoron, a fusion of \"Old\" and \"New.\" Praised and reviled in equal measure, it was condemned for lacking true substance and lauded for its evocation of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). At its genesis, the Gothic mode was born of the union of ancient and modern romances, as seen in Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole, in his \"Gothic Story,\" employed elements both old—theatrical trappings—and new—the novel's personal introspection—to forge a path uncharted. The Gothic, with its echoes of medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, was viewed as a relic, archaic and unsophisticated amidst the heady advances of modern society. Yet, it persists, obsolete and new, a paradox that resonates through time.\n\nOne tenet that permeates the Gothic is the concept of Chivalry. In its essence, it is the training of a proper knight, a remnant of medieval ideals, yet transmuted in Walpole's work. Walpole, in the throes of political turmoil and personal despair, may have seen in the chivalric ideal a morality and goodness lost in the present. Through characters like Frederic, he ideals of the chivalric past are romanticized, hinting at the evolving Gothic to Romanticism. Frederic, a prince, is described thus:\n\n\"The gallant and courteous Knight,\" his figure exaggerated, embodying the Gothic trope of excess.",
            "Supply chain management, a labyrinth of processes that weaves together the threads of a business, from the loom of customer orders to the rafters of raw materials, and down through the silos of production and distribution, until it reaches the customer's doorstep. The term, coined in '82 by a consultant named Keith Oliver, is a cipher for the art of planning, executing, and governing the flow of goods and information to satisfy the fickle beast that is the modern consumer. Six pillars support this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nThe first of these, production, is the crucible of the entire process. It is here that decisions are forged, like iron in a furnace, to answer the questions: When? Why? Where? And how? The manager must divine the desires of the market, a fickle creature that shifts like sand. Once the market's heart is understood, the manager can decide what to produce and how much. The choice of where to produce, and which forge to use, is crucial; it must balance volume with quality, and always keep the customer's satisfaction at the forefront. Only then can the manager set about scheduling workloads and maintaining the machinery.\n\nThe second pillar, supply, is a strategic dance of decisions, like a chessmaster playing a game of life and death. It involves determining the core strengths of a facility and negotiating with outsourced partners. A factory may have many divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose which division is best suited for each process. Outsourcing may also be an option, to gain velocity - the ability to provide quality and flexibility while keeping costs low. But remember, every decision echoes down the line, and a wrong move can bring the whole chain crashing down.",
            "In the sultry, dust-choked streets of Rangoon, a sign clings to a wall, a stark declaration: Hitler lives, whispered by the shadows of the past that cling to this land. A lone figure stands there, Ellen Page, her eyes haunted, her fingers gripping a scrap of cardboard. Burma, where the colors of the robes worn by the monks are a beacon of hope, yet the red blood they spill is a grim testament to the power that rules here.\n\nThe air is thick with the stench of corruption and the echo of silence. The junta has held its grip for decades, their thirst for power unquenched. In '62, they seized the reins of government in a coup, and now, they hold their people in an iron grasp. Monks, the spiritual heart of the country, took to the streets, their robes a sea of saffron against the dark tide of oppression. The Saffron Revolution, they called it, a desperate cry for freedom. But the junta, they crushed the spirit of the monks, their monasteries turned into battlegrounds, their sanctity defiled.\n\nForeign eyes were not welcome here. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, paid the ultimate price, his death a chilling warning to all who would dare to look closer at the reality beneath the surface. The official death toll? A mere 13, a number that pales in the face of Colonel Hla Win's defiant truth: \"Many more have fallen. The bodies can be counted in countless thousands.\"\n\nThis is not a new dance. The beast of tyranny has danced through history, from the Roman emperors who claimed god-like power, to the Japanese who believed their rulers descended from the gods themselves, to our own land, where a president stands tall with a man who preaches the gospel of stupidity. Tiananmen Square, a blood-soaked square, where the spirit of dissent was met with the iron fist of the government. The Rwandan genocide, where the stench of death filled the air as Hutu militia groups, with the government's blessing, began their grim work. And Hitler's Third Reich, a dark stain on the history of man, where the Jewish people were rounded up like cattle, their lives snuffed out like candles in the wind.\n\nBut the spirit of the monks, the silent protest of Ellen Page, the echoes of voices silenced, they persist. They are the ghosts of the past, the harbingers of a future where the light of freedom triumphs over the dark tide of oppression.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz is woven with the threads of his endurance and the creative tapestry he wove for his ensemble. His touch on the piano is a quiet, almost unassuming presence in many of his compositions, yet as a composer, he excelled in crafting rich, intricate pieces that allowed each band member to shine like a beacon. Ellington created a framework wherein a soloist could wander freely, writing passages that leaned on the particular tone and style of each member to illuminate the music's core. His mastery of each player's voice, and how they blended into a cohesive whole, led him to pen some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its examination of Ellington's sound and innovation, points to \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This early composition, a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues, showcases Ellington's ability to add texture and color without lyrics, and to complement the style of his soloists. The piece unfolds in six choruses, each a microcosm of Ellington's genius:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning smooth and melodic, then morphing into a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus in a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds, the voice now growling like an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a layer of tonal complexity to this piece is but one instance of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington weaves his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing marries the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, as Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone.\n\nEllington's ability to mold the unique voices of his musicians into a cohesive, innovative sound is a testament to his genius.",
            "She'd always felt a gnawing emptiness, a hunger that gnawed at her soul. It began when she was fourteen, as the world turned its eyes on her, and it remained, a yearning that refused to abate. At seventeen, she no longer sought things; she yearned for a connection, yet no boy had ever stirred her. Some had tried, their clumsy overtures a dance of desperation, but none had been successful. She questioned this strange absence, plaguing her mind with theories that amounted to little more than whispers in the dark.\n\nHer home was usually a sanctuary, a place of quiet calm. Her father and mother were a pair of silent sentinels, their voices soft as the wind through the trees. Arguments were rare, their daughter's spirit a storm that did not break their truce. Yet, today was not like the others. As she wandered, seeking some new spark in her life, she heard it - a cry, sharp as a blade, her mother's voice echoing in pain. She rushed, her heart a drum in her chest, to find her mother lying on the floor, her breath coming in short gasps. \"Mama?\" she cried, her voice a plea. \"What's wrong?\"\n\nHer mother's face was a mask of pain, her eyes swimming with tears. \"Sweetheart,\" she whispered, her voice a fractured thing. \"Hospital. Need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter nodded, a fierce determination in her eyes. She was her strength, her mother's shield. She carried her to the car, her muscles burning, and drove. The hospital was a place of antiseptic and fear, but she did not see it. Her mind was a whirlwind of worry, her heart a drumbeat of dread.\n\nThe vase. Her mother had fallen from the step stool, reaching for the vase. A simple thing, a moment's misstep, and yet it had brought her to this. She waited, her heart a drum in her chest, as the doctors swarmed around like vultures.",
            "This investigation sought to demonstrate that adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as evidenced by a high \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) diet score, is correlated with a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a variant of the Med diet, emphasizes higher consumption of plant foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, alongside monounsaturated fats and fish, while restricting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permissible.\n\nPrevious studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and both total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, with intervention trials revealing the Med diet's superiority over low-fat diets in facilitating weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. Prior investigations did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, with no history of CVD or diabetes, participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a 121,700 female nurse cohort across 11 US states. Over six intervals, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses remained participants throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Incident CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke cases were confirmed through medical, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were evaluated for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity assessed beginning in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (by averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) through adjustments for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile exhibited a reduced risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annus mirabilis of 2007, the once-great United States of America found itself mired in a financial quagmire that would leave the nation reeling for years to come. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the housing market teetered on the brink of collapse, and many of the nation's most formidable corporations were left desolate and unyielding. This calamity, which still echoes through the halls of power, begs the question: what transpired to bring about this catastrophe, and how might we avert such a calamity in the future?\n\nThe seeds of this calamity were sown in the halcyon days of the Clinton reign, as the President sought to secure a second term by appeasing the masses. To this end, the administration loosened the reins on lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes, of the New York Times, foretold the impending doom in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" He would go on to prophecy, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nMany factors conspired to send the nation into a tailspin, but chief among them was the labyrinthine structure of mortgages that had been constructed. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) entwined the nation's financial markets in a complex and perilous web. This, in turn, left households and financial institutions alike dangerously exposed to the housing market's whims.\n\nIndeed, the housing market's bubble burst, and the institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities found themselves spurned. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a staggering sum that accounted for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a fraction of their worth, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to assume the mantle of commercial banks, subject to the iron fist of regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under the watchful eye of the government in September 2008.",

In film, exposition is the monologue, the outpouring of information from one character to another, akin to the ballad of the ancient mariner. In fiction, it is the author's voice that speaks the words, the stage upon which the actor of the past doth dance.\n\nConsider, if you will, a tale of a heroine and her beloved. 'Twas told that they met at such a place and time, that they wed in grand ceremony, and that her husband was slain before her very eyes. Wouldst thou expect this tale to span two pages, in which neither uttered more than two words? Nay, the author doth owe the reader a feast of words, a banquet of characters, a symphony of emotions. The husband's love should be evidenced in his speech and manner, and the heroine's heart should be laid bare in the smallest of gestures, so that thou mightst mourn with her and grow to love her as thou wouldst love thyself.\n\nIn short, thou must provide flesh to the bones of thy story, for 'tis not enough to merely say that they met, they wed, he died. The reader craves more, dear heart, more than the simple truth. They crave the tale that will make their hearts flutter, their souls stir, their blood boil. They crave the tale that will make them weep, that will make them laugh, that will make them feel alive.\n\nSo, when thou findest thyself tempted to rush past certain things, to mention the Air Force days of a gas station manager, the two failed marriages, the secret dreams of owning the station and the breakfast of champions, remember this: the reader doth not want a list. They want a story. A story that will make them care, that will make them feel, that will make them remember long after the last page is turned.",
            "I beheld two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, one a live affair, the other a mere echo. NBC 4 they called it, and the first tale they spun was of a man in Ashley, Ohio, who'd plunged a blade into his wife's flesh. Evil did not mar his visage, yet pure malice gleamed from his eyes. Two minutes they gave him, no more, as the tale was still unraveling.\n\nAnother story, of a young man named Travis Buyers, shot down in Sharon Woods, his life hanging by a thread. No arrests, no suspects, the SWAT team prowled the woods. The tale was brief, almost as if the color of his skin, or the hue of the neighborhood, dictated its length.\n\nA gunshot through the Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle, it seemed. Five thousand dollars they offered, for a lead to the shooter. The weather forecast followed, thunder and rain, temperatures mid-eighties. A teaser, they called it, to keep the audience glued to the screen.\n\nA robbery at Clime Road UDF, a dark-skinned man in a hoodie, six feet tall, one-fifteen pounds heavy. The tale they spun, a dance of detail, the color of his skin the rhythm, a strange beat.\n\nA drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic man, twenty-five years in prison. But they spoke of three hundred months, as if the weight of the sentence might be lost in the arithmetic. His skin, his origin, they said, as if they felt it necessary.",
            "There is a bond between brothers, an unyielding, unbroken bond. Within this bond, emotions swirl like dark waters: love, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Brothers see in one another their own reflections, and in the direst of circumstances, the true nature of this bond is laid bare, whether it be for good or ill. The cost of understanding these emotions is steep, for they carry with them a heavy burden. When one gazes into the eyes of their brother, they see not what others see, but what they truly are. In their actions and the repercussions thereof lies their true character.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers navigate this theme, and the raging emotions that accompany it. Through a landscape lush and vividly described, these two boys embark on a hopeless journey. Bitter resentment and intense pride collide in the climactic scene, and only one brother survives the ordeal. The theme is expressed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's point of view, which elucidates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him, both of which shape his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first venture together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother to teach all his worldly skills, to run, jump, climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp, to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. But Doodle's frail heart made these dreams impossible. He was born with a heart so weak that it was unlikely he would even survive, let alone participate in such vigorous activities. What a bitter blow to the young protagonist's wild fantasies! He even contemplates suffocating Doodle with a pillow, a child's dark secret. Yet, when Doodle smiles at him, hope is kindled, and his resolve weakens. His heart, despite his anger, contains an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the annals of mortal intellect, the brain is an intricate, labyrinthine tapestry, woven with threads of thought and information. As the arc of technological progress unfurls, so too have the metaphors spawned to describe the ineffable workings of our minds. From the ancient wax tablet to the parchment scroll, from the bound volume to the machine, each metaphor has its utility and its limitations.\n\nThe dance of perception commences with the humble sensors, which translate the exterior world into electrochemical whispers. This symphony of signals, both ascending and descending, is the brain's ballet. In the example of a black box against a white expanse, the bottom-up process assembles the simplest of elements - hue, alignment, and perimeter - to declare the presence of a box. The top-down, however, emboldens this recognition, imbuing the object with significance - a black box, not a hollow in the void.\n\nThe sieve of attention, ever vigilant, sifts and selects. While the brain may feast on the minutiae of a field of grass, it discards the inconsequential, allowing us to hear our own name in a clamor of noise. This dance of cognition is a delicate choreography, where the fruits of perception are repeatedly refined and moderated by the filter of attention.\n\nInformation, to be processed, must first be captured. The brain's memory is a vast repository, its contents encoded in myriad ways. The visual, the auditory, the verbal - each has its own cipher. In the realm of long-term memory, the structure of proteins is postulated to maintain our enduring thoughts. The organization of this knowledge is a matter of debate, with models ranging from the retrieval patterns of humans to the algorithms of the machine, each offering a different lens through which to view the mind's vast landscape.",
            "In the grim pages of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a dystopian vision unfurls, a critique of the encroaching tide of technology and the capitalist structure that supports it. The society depicted here values community above the individual, and from the cradle to the grave, its citizens are conditioned to pursue immediate gratification above all else. They are little more than pawns in a grand game, their ideologies shaped by the iron will of the World Controller. Through the lens of Marxist thought, Huxley's novel reveals a deep-seated suspicion of the systems that govern us, with terms like homogeny and reification reinforcing the notion that this is a commentary on the flaws inherent in the emerging economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism, in Huxley's vision, is a beast that feeds on the false consciousness of its subjects. The common folk are blinded by their own desires, unable to see the true nature of their economic relations. They are, as Marx would put it, \"falsely conscious,\" their interests manipulated by the ruling class. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, and the like, have no will of their own, their desires for consumption and indulgence stoked by the hypnopædia, a tool of the World Controller. Hegemony, the dominance of one class over another, is writ large in this world, as the lower classes are unaware of their own oppression, buying into an ideology that supports their own exploitation. The upper classes, the Alphas and Betas, are born into this knowledge, yet few act against it, accepting their place in the hierarchy.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and superficial, a reflection of the society's devaluation of personal expression. Love and deep emotion are absent, replaced by a focus on physical appearance and trivial encounters. The characters, even the major ones, lack depth, their interactions reduced to mere transactions. This is a society where the rise of technology and capitalism has stripped individuals of their free will and expression.\n\nThe obedience of each class to their place in the hierarchy is a symptom of this socioeconomic oppression. They are false proletariats, convinced of their own superiority so long as they consume, obey, and conform to the expectations of their peers. This is the world Huxley presents to us, a chilling mirror of our own times, a warning whispered in the cold wind of a dystopian future.",
            "In this land of towering edifices and sprawling expanses, I've worn the path of the student for nigh on two and three-quarters years. The University Park sprawls vast and wild, a beast that devours time and stamina in equal measure. My freshman year found me ensconced in the farthest reaches of East Halls, a sanctuary of solitude where the winds howl and the shadows grow long. To traverse this kingdom from my humble abode to the heart of the campus, where the Willard building stands tall and proud, would take the stout-hearted half an hour, if the elements were not conspired against me in their myriad forms. Speak with the aged and the wise, and they'll tell you of times when the East Halls were isolated, separated from the rest of the school by vast, untamed lands. Now, those same lands have been tamed, filled with the hum of activity, the clatter of construction, the scent of new growth. Yet, as the campus swells, so does the burden of navigating its ever-changing landscape.\n\nA bicycle, they say, is the answer to this conundrum. Yet, a bicycle alone will not suffice. It requires a willing rider, and a campus that bends to its needs. I've spoken with a friend, a man who'd abandoned his steed for a time, who now marvels at the simplicity of it all. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"they're the only way to make sense of this place.\" And indeed, they are. A hearty breakfast and a little sweat can see you through the longest of journeys. I, too, have succumbed to the allure of the bicycle. My abode off-campus, like the dorms it once surpassed, stands at the edge of this kingdom. Yet, a bike has made the distance bearable. The Thomas building, a mere twenty minutes' walk away, is now but five minutes' ride. Yet, Pollock Road, the straightest path to my destination, is not without its trials. The wind and the inclines, they would test the mettle of any man or machine. And so, I walk, but only when necessity dictates. For time is a precious commodity, and I've learned to cherish it. To spend an extra half-hour each day walking, when I could be learning, is a sacrifice I'm unwilling to make. A bike, it seems, is not merely a mode of transport, but a way of life. And in this kingdom of academia, it's a way of life I've come to embrace."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I am drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I intend to dedicate myself to the care of those who have been abused or neglected, and to provide support for troubled families. The values that I bring to this field are service, respect, and an unwavering commitment to ethical practice, both in my personal life and my professional work. These are not merely values I hold for the sake of social work; they are the cornerstones of my being.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been a driving force, though I have been unsure of the path I should follow. In the crucible of high school and college, I witnessed many souls retreat from their troubles, some with coping mechanisms that were less than optimal. It was during this time that I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a choice that led me to a crossroads upon graduation from Piedmont College in 2009. Unsure of my calling, I took a pause, and one summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He had come to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police. Out of a desire to aid, I drove to his parents' residence and spoke with the authorities. They asked me to speak with the parents, as they could not intervene where the law could not. The parents, when questioned, were nervous and defensive, blaming their son's \"manipulative\" behavior for involving outsiders. This experience ignited a flame within me, and I began to seriously consider a career in social work, where I could help those entangled in family disputes.\n\nAnother value integral to the field of social work is social justice. Our society touts the individual's importance and mourns those lost, yet the concept of the \"individual\" we hold is more often a reflection of archaic traditions than true uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to be like \"everyone else\"? I am an individual, unbound by the expectations of conformity. Throughout my academic journey, I have protested against social injustice in any way I could, from unnatural hair color to nonconformist clothing, ear piercings beyond the norm, and my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), all the while fighting against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice, and I will continue to stand against its injustices.",
            "The following text traverses the labyrinthine realms of the Biological and Sociocultural models as they pertain to the specter of insomnia. The Biological model delves into the esoteric dance of genes and inherited factors, intertwining them with the corporeal aspects of health. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural models cast their gaze upon the environmental tapestry, weaving race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status into the intricate fabric of insomnia.\n\nThe paper that follows is a meticulous exploration of these models, a journey through the research that seeks to illuminate these realms and elucidate the models that govern them. Each piece of research is scrutinized, its strengths and weaknesses laid bare for all to see.\n\nInsomnia, that specter of the night, can manifest in myriad forms: as a primary disorder, a shadow cast by another mental malady, or a phantasm born of medical complications or substance indulgence. The Primary disorders, Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, are the children of the night, while those born of Axis I or Axis II disorders are the puppets of madness and personality's dark siblings. The Dyssomnias, those who struggle to initiate or maintain sleep, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder. The Parasomnias, those who dance with the night in ways both strange and disturbing, include Sleep Terrors, Nightmare Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. This review, however, fixates on insomnia, and in passing, the Primary sleep disorders, under the magnifying lens of the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders is a tangled web of genes, heritable factors, and the physiological aspects of the malady. The hypothalamus, that ancient sentinel, guards the gates of sleep with its orexin neurons. A study conducted on mice revealed a sinister secret: the phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons, responsible for the dance of sleep and wakefulness. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces a trance that promotes sleep, while its inhibition stirs the fires of wakefulness. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in these nocturnal creatures, a finding that whispers of a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence of this receptor could be the hand that snuffs out the flame of adequate sleep, leaving one to stumble through life.\n\nThe Sociocultural implications of this study are as vast as the night sky. If the phenotype is inherited, it could be the hand that caresses sleep, a gentle touch that lulls one into rest. An alteration of this receptor could be the icy breath of the night, a chilling wind that disturbs the slumber. The impact on one's life would be as profound as the sweep of a storm, echoing through the hallowed halls of school, the boardrooms of career, and the monotonous tasks of the day.",
            "In the desolate wastelands of the mind, a malady known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or Auditory Processing Disorder, festers. It is a plague that strikes the central nervous system, impeding its ability to properly process auditory information. The afflicted may hear as others do, yet their brain, that great interpreter of sound, falters. It is not a impairment of hearing, but a affliction of comprehension, a bane that leaves the soul deaf to the whisper of words amidst the cacophony of the world.\n\nThe history of this ailment echoes through the annals of time, dating back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first dubbed it \"auditory imperception\". Italian scholars Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, in the year of '54, began to pen the first tests for the stricken, while Kimura, in '61, introduced a model to unlock the physiognomy of the Central Nervous System's travail. In '77, a great convocation of minds convened, spurring the pursuit.\n\nThe symptoms of this curse are manifold. The afflicted may struggle to locate the source of sound, to distinguish between similar acoustic events, to recognize patterns in sound, to decipher speech's nuances, to separate one sound from the next, and to order the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosis, a task as arduous as crossing the desert for water, requires keen observation and myriad tests, a process as varied as the sand dunes. No single tool or cause has been found, and the affliction remains a mystery, a shadow that haunts the brain.",
            "In the theatre of deceit, a mask may be a shield, but it is also a noose. Twelfth Night teaches us that beneath the guise of another, a man risks losing his true self. The end of a lie often leaves one adrift, estranged from those they have deceived, for some will find offense in truth. Yet, a difficult choice must be made: to retain one's own being or to preserve the bonds of those around. This is especially true in the realm of deception in gender role reversal, for it raises questions of identity and protection. Why the need to don a disguise, to become a stranger within one's own skin? In Viola's case, it is clear: a woman alone in a strange land, she transforms to survive. \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) Her plan succeeds, but she is cut off from her kin, isolated like a wolf among sheep. She becomes so convincing that Olivia confuses her with her twin, and falls in love. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) And her own heart aches, for she is drawn to Orsino, who sees her not as a woman, but as a boy. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nYet, this tale may hold a truth for the modern eye. It shows how a lie can force the hidden to the surface. Olivia and Orsino may have unspoken desires, brought to light by Viola's guise. \"Cesario,\" Olivia says, \"a sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) Has she fallen for Viola, or is it merely the mask that attracts her? We can't be certain, for Olivia seems more a parrot than a dove, judging by her appearance. She swiftly abandons Cesario, regarding her now as family. Thus, Twelfth Night teaches us that deception, while a dangerous path, may also be a road to truth.",
            "The German colonial might, often marked by a harsh and unforgiving hand, left an indelible stain on the annals of history, particularly in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Yet, as with any vast empire, the German colonial dominion presented a multitude of faces, each one as varied as the lands it claimed. Educational endeavors in these colonies mirrored this diversity.\n\nIn East Africa, now known as Tanganyika, the British found a populace that had been touched by the seeds of learning, sown by German educational initiatives. Yet, in South West Africa, a different narrative unfurled. The task of educating the native peoples was largely entrusted to missionaries, who received scant support from the government. The Europeans, however, enjoyed a more privileged status, with the government investing heavily in their education, establishing a system of state schools and providing robust support to missionary institutions.\n\nThe echoes of these policies resonated long after the German rule had faded. While other colonies boasted literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, its population mired in illiteracy. This divergence can be attributed to a myriad of factors, both social, political, and economic. This exploration seeks to delve deeper into these factors, with a particular emphasis on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans.\n\nThe literature on education within the German colonial empire is abundant, much of it penned in German and originating from the early twentieth century, during and shortly after the era of German colonial rule. These early works were largely descriptive, chronicling the features of the educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English works expanded this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses. Notable among these is Cohen's study, which compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, discussing the factors that contributed to their differences.\n\nSouth West Africa, unlike other German colonies, possessed a moderately temperate climate, with arid deserts covering much of its territory. This hospitable climate attracted a significant European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites called South West Africa home, a figure that dwarfed the next largest settler population in East Africa, which stood at 5,336.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has seen a remarkable expansion over the past century, encompassing an array of genres, numerous sub-genres, and even sub-sub-genres, making a definitive list seem an impossible task. From the raw, unbridled energy of rock to the intricate melodies of jazz, each genre has spawned its own offshoots, creating a labyrinth of musical expression. Among these, none perhaps has evolved as profoundly as Heavy Metal, a genre that has burgeoned into a sprawling, multifaceted movement over the past four decades.\n\nHeavy Metal, in its essence, is a symphony of darkness. It is a music of extremes—loud, ferocious, theatrical. It is a genre where musicians wield their instruments with a precision that borders on virtuosity. Heavy Metal is also a genre that has been inextricably linked with the psychedelic drug boom of the 1970s, with many musicians tapping into the altered states of consciousness to craft their most innovative, otherworldly works.\n\nThe darkness of Metal is not merely a stylistic choice; it is a manifestation of a deep-seated emotional landscape. Unlike many forms of popular music, Heavy Metal has long been a bastion for the darker, more visceral aspects of human emotion. It is a genre that has drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era, channeling the same dark, melancholic themes into its lyrics. The words penned by Byrne in \"Helter Skelter,\" for instance, exemplify this darker side of the movement:\n\n*Byrne:*\n\nThese lyrics, from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" demonstrate the darker underbelly of the musical landscape. It is a song that embodies the up and down, the volatility, supposedly of drug-induced states. Considered by some as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, it was a response to the heavier, darker sound of the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, in their quest to prove their heaviness, released this track on The White Album.",
            "In the twilight years preceding the surrealists' advent into the world of dreamlike art, Henri Rousseau, a man of modest means and even more modest education, was weaving his own dreams into the fabric of his canvases. \"The Dream\" of 1910, a work of art that would come to define his legacy, is not merely a depiction of a woman enthralled by the wonders of her slumbering realm; it is a reflection of Rousseau's own inner conflict, a battle between the desire to be accepted and the yearning to remain true to his unique vision.\n\nTo understand this painting fully, one must first delve into the life of its creator. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a small town in the northwest of France. His father, a tinsmith and hardware dealer, enjoyed a life of bourgeois comfort. However, the young Rousseau was not to benefit from his father's prosperity; instead, he was consigned to a life of labor, first as a municipal toll collector, later as a custom inspector, a position earned through his sobriquet, \"douanier.\" His life was marked by loss, the early deaths of his first wife and eight children, leaving him with only his daughter, Julia, and an abiding sorrow. It was in painting that he sought solace, a means to escape the harsh realities of his life and forge a new path.\n\nRousseau's struggle for acceptance is a tale not uncommon in the annals of art history. An uneducated man, late in life, he found himself amidst a thriving artistic scene, where many more renowned artists already commanded respect and admiration. He longed for the same recognition, yet his journey was fraught with the tension between conforming to the established norms of art and remaining true to his own unique voice. His desire for acceptance was not born out of vanity, but of a deep-seated need to be seen, to be understood.\n\nIn \"Modern French Painters,\" Jan Gordon posits that Henri Rousseau and Henri Matisse, two painters of seemingly contrasting styles and subjects, were united in their pursuit of recognition. However, their motivations were starkly different. Matisse, driven by a fear of triteness, sought to break the boundaries of art. Rousseau, on the other hand, dreamt of a picture so conventional that it would gain him admittance to the Artiste Français, a group he admired from afar.\n\nIn \"The Dream,\" Rousseau's internal struggle is laid bare for all to see. The woman in the painting, awestruck by the dreamworld she inhabits, is a mirror to the artist himself. She stands at a crossroads, torn between the familiar and the extraordinary, between the world of acceptance and the world of her dreams. It is this tension, this willingness to confront his own demons, that makes Henri Rousseau a truly remarkable figure in the annals of art history.",
            "In the vast expanse of thought, many a sage has posited a kinship between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. They are, after all, two sides of the same coin, for beauty is truth, and truth, beauty, as Keats so aptly put it, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" — \"That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of these twin realms is not born of study or mere experience, but rather, they are felt, like the breath of a distant wind, whispering secrets in the dark.\n\nCritique, it seems, is but a pale reflection of the essence of art or morality. A discourse on the Mona Lisa's worth may touch upon composition, color, or context, yet it fails to capture the heart of the matter. For when asked of a favorite piece, we often find ourselves resorting to terms like, \"there's just something about it,\" as if to suggest there's a mystery deeper than words can convey.\n\nBoth art and ethics, it seems, contain a ineffable quality, a je ne sais quoi that defies description. As Flannery O'Connor once wrote, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\" and this is true for ethics as well. Even the most thorough analysis of a literary work leaves something unsaid, an unspoken truth that hovers just beyond the reach of language. This is the transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics, their secret sinew, their hidden power.\n\nIt is this very transcendence that binds morality and art together, for we experience them in a way that is both profound and elusive. We feel it, but we cannot fully grasp it, like the touch of an ephemeral ghost. This is especially true for literature, for as McKean has said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts... is its moral quality.\" Literature, it seems, is not just a vessel of values, but a living embodiment of them.",
            "The Germany of this age, a forceful and unified entity, bears a singular culture, its roots tracing back from the gloom of the Alps in Munich, to the stark shores of the Baltic Sea in Kiel. This culture echoes through the streets of Cologne, along the Rhine, and into the heart of Dresden, on the Elbe. Such a culture, born of myriad sources and tribes, is not an anomaly. Germania, the ancestral land of the Germans, has a name whose origins are shrouded in dissent among scholars and historians.\n\nSome claim the name was bestowed by a Germanic tribe, the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. Yet, others suggest it was borrowed from the Gauls themselves, who used it to differentiate between those they had conquered and those they had not. The Roman general Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, employed this term, taken from the Gauls, to describe the tribes beyond the Rhine with whom they were engaged in perpetual conflict. The word's origin is uncertain, but it may derive from the spear the Germans wielded in battle, known as a ger, or perhaps from the Old Irish garim, meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' boisterous nature.\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" wrote of the Germans, \"I would deem them aboriginal, not mixed with other races through migration or intercourse. For, in times past, those seeking new lands would not travel by land to Germania but by ship. Who, driven by some folly, would forsake Asia or Africa for Italy to settle in Germania, with its wild lands, harsh skies, and sullen demeanor?\" And who, save the Romans, would choose to dwell among these tribes? Certainly not the Romans themselves. They would send forth their legions to these distant lands, seeking riches and to expand their empire, yet they would ultimately return to Rome.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes began to emerge in the first century, they inhabited the borders of the vast Roman Empire. They traded their goods and skills, serving in the ranks of the Roman army in exchange for Roman coin and protection. Thus, the stage was set for the convergence of cultures, the birth of a nation that would become Germany as we know it today.",
            "I gazed downwards, my mind as blank as the void before me. Unblinking, unyielding, it was a studied silence, an unrelenting comprehension that refused to give in to abstraction. Thoughts flickered and danced, ephemeral as the dust motes in the sunlight. My consciousness, a river of liquid thought, navigated the landscape before me with a practiced ease, as if my own thoughts were but currents in a vast and ancient sea.\n\nOnce, a man of art had advised me, a text he proffered, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since childhood, I had yearned for this skill, and this book promised to unveil the mysteries of line and form. Among its teachings was a technique, a square frame to tame the chaos of a scene, to reduce a riot of colors and shapes into a single, manageable entity.\n\nThere it was before me, a swirling maelstrom of brown, defiant in its ordinariness. The toilet, a humdrum object, now a monument to human folly. Picasso's blue period, Monet's greenery, the Italian Renaissance's prismatic hues - all pale in the face of this mundane tableau. Yet, in this moment, I felt the stirrings of something greater, the birth of a new story, Work in Brown.\n\nFingers traced the contours of my tool, a humble brush against the universe's canvas. Muscles tensed, released, as my hand moved through space, giving form to the thoughts that danced in my mind. Water swirled, a calm and serene sea, as my hand dipped into the abyss, a mother's gentle touch on her newborn child.\n\nThe offensive package, a rude message to the janitors of Rite Aid, remained unmoved, a stubborn, brown slug on the toilet's hard underbelly. More flushes, more moments of quiet introspection, and then my hand reached out, grasped the paper, and began its slow dance, a mummification of sorts.\n\nStanding tall, then bending low, my hand dipped into the bowl, a mother's tender touch on her Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "In the land where the young and reckless roam, their steel steeds of chrome and glass, the specter of youthful folly cuts a swath through the heartland, leaving behind a trail of wreckage and broken dreams. The National Institutes of Health, in their infinite wisdom, have unearthed a truth that is as stark as the Austin Peay: the adolescent mind, it seems, is not yet ready for the dance of death that is driving.\n\nThe roots of this calamity are many and entwined, like the gnarled fingers of an ancient oak. Inexperience, that most insidious of foes, lies at the core of this tragedy. The young driver, like a tender sapling, is ill-equipped to withstand the gales of speed and the tempests of the open road. They weave and careen, as if possessed by some demonic spirit, their paths leading them off the edge of the world, into the abyss.\n\nAnd when they are not alone, but in the company of their peers, the danger is magnified. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has laid bare the truth: the more numerous the passengers, the greater the likelihood of collision. It is a grim calculus, a macabre arithmetic of youth and insouciance.\n\nThe states, in their wisdom, have sought to mitigate this scourge with measures that are as ephemeral as morning mist. Provisional licenses, with their curfews and restrictions, are but a Band-Aid on a festering wound. The problem, plain and stark as the setting sun, is that the young drivers are, by all statistical measures, ill-equipped to bear the weight of responsibility.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman, in his relentless pursuit of understanding, has posited that even the tender age of 18 is too soon for the young to wield the keys to a motor vehicle. The thrill-seekers, those young knights of the open road, are drawn to the danger like moths to the flame. It is a natural impulse, a primal yearning, but one that must be tempered by time and experience.\n\nYet, we continue to bestow upon them the keys to the kingdom, and the death toll rises. By 2010, the children of the Baby Boomers will be ready, and the roads will run red with their blood. The legislation I propose is as simple as it is necessary. Schools can continue their tutelage, but no young hand should grasp the wheel until the age of 18. Provisional permits can still be issued, but no young soul should be granted unbridled power over a machine of death until they have proven themselves worthy.\n\nThe legislation I propose is not new, but it is necessary. It is a call to arms, a rallying cry for the preservation of our young. For if we do not act, if we do not raise our voices against this scourge, then the dust of the roads will be forever stained with the blood of the innocents.",
            "In the annals of the Library of Congress’s archive, I chanced upon a trove of early Edison films, numbering fifteen from the years 1895 to 1901. These were trick films, each a dance of creativity and deceit, their illusions woven by the subtle artistry of editing. My study of these films was a labor of loving detail, my gaze fixed on the poetics that underpinned most, and the eccentricities that marked a few of the later works. Trick films of that time, bound to the stage, bore the frontal proscenium like a badge of honor, unmoving cameras observing from afar, no camera movement, long and medium shots the norm, each one shot a film unto itself.\n\nYet, even these rigid rules were not unbreachable. Some dared to stray, introducing multiple shots, a rude awakening to the constraints of the one shot, one film mantra.\n\nThe stage was their realm, the camera held captive within the frame of the proscenium. Figures moved left to right, never venturing towards the lens, a limitation born of the theatre and vaudeville roots that birthed these films. In 'Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel' (1900), actors entered from the right, traversing the horizontal axis, vanishing from the frame without the camera's intervention.\n\nLong shots were the order of the day, with the occasional medium shot, close-ups a stranger to these films. Borrowed from the theatre, it was a full view the audience required, the borders of the stage framing the entire performance. Actors did not move towards the lens, so close-ups were strangers to these films.\n\nThe rule of one shot, one film reigned supreme, limiting length to a minute or less. Trick films were not for grand narratives, but for brief vaudeville-style tricks, magic, disappearing, and switching acts. Yet, a single conceptual shot hid a physical reality: a single “shot” was often a tapestry of joined frames, woven to deceive the eye.\n\nIn 'The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots' (1895), the illusion of a single shot hid the truth of multiple frames. Mary's severed \"head\" appeared in a physical shot, yet the film was conceived as one shot to the viewer.",
            "In the unforgiving expanse of Caroline, John Taylor emerged as a steadfast adherent to the creed of Republicanism. A man of the land, his agrarian roots and brief sojourn in politics forged a soul unyielding in the defense of personal liberty and governance. His reverence for the agrarian life colored his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the very bedrock of the judicial system itself.\n\nTaylor saw in the fledgling United States a canvas unmarred by native tradition, a chance to paint a society governed by itself. He held fast to the natural rights of man, believing them to be interwoven and indivisible. Deny one, and all are diminished, he argued, and these rights must be shielded from the grasp of the government. The state of nature, he posited, was a world ruled by the strong and the cunning, yet in civilization, this must not be the way.\n\nTo craft this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the inherent good and evil within man. A rigid dualist, he clung to the notion that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., p. 167). He deemed good principles those that safeguarded private property, advanced agriculture, and shunned capitalism. A government founded on such tenets, he believed, would function justly, despite the inevitable taint of avarice and self-interest that would lead its administration.\n\nSelf-interest, Taylor maintained, was the very essence of man, but it became a cancer when it fostered sub-societies that preyed upon others. A good government was necessary to keep man's natural evil in check, he argued, and even then, it must be watched vigilantly to prevent the intrusion of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like his fellow Republicans, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He called for a Federal government shackled by the bounds of its explicit powers and wary of the cost and corruption that accompanies its expansion. Yet, he cautioned that a simple, literal interpretation was as perilous as it was seductive, without the compass of the writers' intent. The Declaration of Independence, he claimed, was the true charter of the United States, for it more clearly portrayed the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a monolithic whole.",
            "Upon revisiting Figure 17, it became plainly evident that there was a precipitous dip in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. This was something of a grim observation, and the cause of this decline remained unclear. The onset of winter in our New England locale, coupled with the end of the fall semester, were both plausible reasons for the reduced foot and bicycle traffic. The holiday season's encroachment did not help, as both students and faculty were consumed by their final tasks, with the commuter log seemingly falling off their radar. The winter months saw a natural ebb in momentum, a decline that we attempted to counteract with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This blitz, though successful in boosting submissions for that month, did little to combat the overall decline in participation.\n\nThe intrinsic appeal of driving, deeply ingrained in our culture, presented a further challenge. To combat this, we offered a variety of incentives: gift certificates for local eateries, coffee shops, massage parlors, an independent bookstore, and even some national chains. Yet, it was not beyond contemplation that larger prizes might have spurred greater engagement. A bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car could have been a more potent draw, especially if the larger prizes were revealed incrementally over the project's duration. The initial gift cards proved sufficient, but a more progressive escalation of prizes might have kept the project's momentum from faltering.",
            "In the realm of finance, an ETF, or exchange-traded fund, stands as a peculiar breed of security, designed to mimic the movements of an index, commodity, or a collection of assets much like an index fund, yet possessing the nimbleness to trade like a stock on the open market. An ETF offers the diversification of an index fund, the singular nature of stock ownership, and the versatility to sell short, purchase on margin, or buy as little as a single share in any transaction. These advantages, while enticing, come with the drawback of incurring commissions akin to those imposed on stock orders. The allure of ETFs also lies in the plethora of funds available, a consideration that prompts the astute investor to question whether the touted benefits, such as diversification, indeed manifest and to what extent.\n\nFor this exercise, we shall scrutinize the ETF IHF, comparing it to its top ten holdings, which constitute 63.58% of its total assets. Below are the top ten holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the fidelity of these ten stocks in representing the ETF IHF, we shall normalize the current percentage of assets to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming such a portfolio consisted entirely of these ten stocks in their proportional holdings. The results are as follows:\n\nFrom the above chart, it is clear that a portfolio composed solely of these top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% greater than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 less than that of the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings might offer higher returns with a lower Beta. However, it remains to be seen if these two portfolios are statistically different from one another.\n\nTo ascertain this, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing them to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the annals of Edgar Allan Poe's literary corpus, \"Dream-Land\" is often hailed as one of his most haunting and enigmatic poems. Within its hallowed lines, Poe deploys the term \"Thulé,\" a nomenclature that echoes the ancient poetic tradition, tracing back to Virgil's invocation of a distant isle beyond the known world. Yet, there is more to the tale. For Poe, a man whose mind was a labyrinth of literary allusions, the term \"Thulé\" held a resonance born not of mere historical echoes, but of a more immediate and profound inspiration.\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his seminal work \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" posits a connection between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"The King of Thule.\" In this short poem, Goethe paints a portrait of a king bereft, his life desecrated by the loss of his queen. The parallels between \"The King of Thule\" and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are stark and unmistakable. The king's descent into despair, his heavy drinking, and his ultimate decision to cast his life into the sea resonate with a grim familiarity. It is as if Poe, in his own dark genius, had stepped into Goethe's shadow and whispered his own lament.\n\n\"The King of Thule,\" penned by Goethe and later transformed into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan, was published a mere twelve months before Poe's own use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" This temporal proximity lends credence to the notion that Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is, in many senses, a meditation on Goethe's \"The King of Thule.\"\n\nPoe's use of \"Thule\" in \"Dream-Land\" is not a mere coincidence, but a deliberate echo, a call and response to the literary landscape of his time. The landscape of \"Thule\" is not merely a geographical marker but a psychological state, a dark and desolate realm where the speaker is haunted by the specters of the past. This desolation, this lonely journey, is more than a simple poetic conceit; it is a reflection, albeit oblique, of the loss and despair that Poe himself may have felt.\n\nGoethe, a celebrated writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" was a figure of considerable literary significance in Poe's time. His influence was palpable, not merely through his own works, but through the many reproductions and adaptations that were circulating within the intellectual circles of the era. Poe's admiration for Tennyson, as evidenced in his own writings, suggests a deep respect for the literary traditions of the time. It is therefore not unreasonable to suggest that Poe's use of \"Thulé\" in \"Dream-Land\" is not just an echo of the past, but a conversation with the present, a dialogue with the literary ghost of his time.\n\nIn the end, Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is not just a poem about a dream, but a poem about a man lost in a world without color, haunted by the ghosts of the past. It is a poem that whispers of loss and despair, of a king who, like so many others, has been claimed by the sea. And in this, it stands as a stark testament to the continuing influence of the past, a past that Poe knew so well, and a past that he, in his own unique way, brought to life.",
            "Under the law of the Golden State, would a customer, struck down by fate and circumstance, be granted retribution for their pain and suffering if they had slipped and fallen on a spill of applesauce in a grocer's establishment? The answer may be found in the heart of the matter, in the actions of one Paul Martin, the store's manager. For what was his sin, but to know, and yet to do nothing, to turn his back on the cries of his customers, for the sake of a meal?\n\nThe law of California, in its wisdom, allows for such retribution when a defendant's actions are marked by a willful disregard for the safety of others, or when their conduct is so despicable as to warrant such a punishment. Jennifer Palmer, the unfortunate customer, could argue that Martin, with his knowledge of past slips and falls in the very same aisles, acted with a willful disregard for her safety. He failed to act, even as his employees warned him, even as the spilled applesauce lay like a trap, waiting for its next victim.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand and nine, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager of the spill. \"I'm on dinner break,\" Martin replied, \"no time for such matters.\" Later, Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, relayed the same message, yet again, to no avail. At the stroke of half past five, Jennifer Palmer met her fate. Before her, five others had fallen, but still, Martin did nothing, preferring his meal to his duty.\n\nThe law, in its austere majesty, defines malice not as intent, but as action, or inaction, that shows a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others. Martin's failure to act, his willful disregard for the probable harm that would come to those who entered his domain, could be seen as such a crime.\n\nThe question remains, will his malice be punished? The courts will decide, but one thing is clear: Paul Martin's inaction, his willful disregard for the safety of his customers, makes him a man of despicable character. And that, perhaps, is the greatest punishment of all.",
            "Nearly four years hence, I undertook a course in the history of Islam at CBC. Amongst the heated debates that ensued, the question of Islam's hostility towards the world consumed much of our discourse. I believe this query more pertinent than ever in the wake of 9/11. The pendulum of American perception of Islam and extremism has swung wildly since that fateful day, from hostility to an almost fanatical tolerance. Could we, in the year 2001, have imagined a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, bearing a Muslim surname and familial ties to the faith?\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad, a chronicle that has captured my curiosity, presents a narrative that jars with my understanding of the man. Official history posits Muhammad as a subjugator, conquering tribes and forcing his faith upon them. Yet, the biography paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and humbled, with converts coming to his teachings of their own accord. This style of storytelling, I contend, seeks to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, living in truth and miracles, akin to the Messiah, yet it belies the true nature of his rise to power.\n\nIndeed, parallels exist between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad. The feeding of forty men with a meager portion of mutton and milk is but one such instance, a tale meant to elevate Muhammad's status, much like the miracles attributed to Christ. This, I argue, is a disingenuous ploy, a usurpation of the life and personhood of Jesus.\n\nFurthermore, many stories in the biography seem designed to authenticate Muhammad's teachings, depicting firsthand accounts of converts. Yet, these narratives often rely on second- or thirdhand sources, diminishing their credibility. The author's intent may be to present these as irrefutable proofs, but I find them suspiciously vague and unreliable.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad to godly status, depicting him as humble, wise, and gentle. Historical records cast doubt on this portrayal, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history of their prophet's rise to power.",
            "The words of the Nazarene and the tenets he espoused in his brief sojourn among men were swiftly subsumed into the burgeoning tide of Christian thought that followed his departure. If one were to cast a gaze upon the annals of this faith, one could discern a trajectory that veers ever further from its origins. The world today bears witness to a rising tide of awareness and a relentless march of progress that seems both inexorable and imminent. Traditionalists, hued in the hues of yesteryears, will persist in their resistance to any idea that transcends what was whispered in the shadows of their youth. Yet, these stalwarts are but a fraction of the whole. Among the faithful, a growing consciousness of history will stir, compelling them to parse the doctrines appended over the centuries from the true intent of the religion's namesake. It matters not if this awakening takes decades or centuries to unfold; the outcome is as inevitable as the setting sun. A movement will swell, stripping away the accretions of doctrine one by one, as if time itself had reversed its flow. When this tide has crested and receded, all that will remain is a conception of what the Nazarene brought to humanity, unclouded by the claims of others. When this tide sweeps through the lands of the United States and Europe, it will carry with it a newfound reverence, as if we were once more in his time, heeding only his words. The church will stand strong, a beacon guiding the faithful. Yet, the theological clock having turned back, the profusion of diversity will yield to a uniformity of belief and practice. Where once there were divisions, there will be unity. This is not the first great reversion. The Romans, once persecutors of the faith, became its steward. Our nation, once the crucible of African-American servitude, now bears witness to their leadership. The great reversion that looms before us will unfold in the crucible of Christian belief, undoing history in its quest for the source, and in the process, unraveling the threads of diversity woven through Christendom. It is of paramount importance to acknowledge that this process will be made possible by a newfound understanding of the Nazarene's words, not as literal commandments, but as metaphorical parables. What, then, has transpired since his lifetime?\n\nIf we delve deep into the annals of time, we find only Judaism, the theological wellspring of Christianity. Monotheism, the revelation of a divine religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were the bedrock of this faith by the time the Romans took Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not as one in spirit. They were divided: the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and the multitude of common folk.",
            "In the jaws of industry, Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" plucks at the rot within the human heart. The mind, it seems, is a ceaseless well of greed and self-preservation, ever seeking to elevate itself, regardless of the squalor it leaves in its wake. The factories, those monolithic behemoths, stand as a testament to the unyielding ambition of their masters. They care not for the pall of smoke that chokes the air, nor for the noxious runoff that befouls the land. Sinclair, in his stark prose, paints a grim portrait of the world below the gleaming chimneys: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" The owners and managers, like some malevolent gods, possess no regard for the living beings that toil beneath them. They care only for the ceaseless march of profit, the endless accumulation of wealth. The workers, too, are mere cogs in this machine, subject to the whims of their overlords. They are forced to labor in conditions that would break even the strongest of spirits, and are cast aside like worthless refuse when the tide of greed turns. The laws of the era, if they existed at all, offered little protection. The unions, once a beacon of hope, became but another shackle, their leaders more interested in lining their own pockets than in bettering the lot of the worker. Sinclair's words echo with the desperation of the downtrodden: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In the vast expanse of literature, authors employ sundry techniques to weave a certain atmosphere or attitude into the hearts and minds of their readers. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his magnum opus, \"The Great Gatsby,\" employs such techniques with calculated precision. He oftentimes pairs words that do not naturally align, imbuing them with a peculiar resonance. He also ascribes symbols with meaning, then deftly employs these symbols to evoke a certain feeling or impression.\n\nFitzgerald, in the hues of his novel, invests considerable significance into colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. The colors white/gray, in particular, he invests with the notion of uniformity, with white symbolizing a higher class and gray signifying age and decay. This is established early in the narrative with the constant use of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are \"in white\" (8), a state that extends to Nick's \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom's \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's \"powdered milky white\" (30) countenance. The only respite from this monochromatic reign is the \"gaudy\" colors of Gatsby's party.\n\nFitzgerald then extends this color scheme to mundane objects and people, reinforcing the association. Nick descends into \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names on his timetable are now \"gray names\" (61), Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), and plain people and places are described in white or gray. Even the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce this meaning is sufficiently established, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to signify unimportance or uniformity, especially in relation to Daisy. After a lengthy absence, Daisy re-enters the narrative \"dressed in white\" and driving a \"little white roadster\" (74), reducing her to a uniform, unattached object that Gatsby longs for. This technique is further applied, with a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her subsequent appearance in a white dress (115) before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color to convey these meanings is a masterclass in subtlety, a testament to his ability to weave symbolism into the very fabric of his narrative.",
            "San Diego County, a land of verdant productivity, owes its fertility to the caress of a mild, sun-kissed climate. The soil yields a bounty of tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A growing appetite for organic, community-supported agriculture has given rise to a thriving market, with local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are in high demand. Many farms here offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational pursuits. This kind of operation allows the landowner to avail themselves of government programs while enhancing habitat, thereby providing recreational use and generating income through tours and educational initiatives.\n\nOrganic farming, while profitable, presents its own unique challenges. The absence of chemicals necessitates meticulous labor and management to ward off pests and weeds, and the soil must be fertilized without the aid of synthetic substances. Losses, too, can be more frequent than with conventional methods. Additionally, the small-scale nature of these operations lacks the efficiency of larger enterprises. Non-farming practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops or managing plant growth, can also incur significant labor costs. This is why a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert guidance in balancing profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe parcel in question, adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It is situated within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently lists over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land, once inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries, was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years. In this scenario, a piece of property was selected from a real estate website, and available government programs were researched to understand the realistic options a small farmer might have for mitigating costs while preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model, an organic farm in the same area was studied.",
            "Culture, in the vast expanse of human endeavor, casts a long shadow. It is a tapestry woven with threads of history, prejudice, and belief, each strand not easily discernible from its neighbors. It is not a monolith nor a singular thing, but a collection of whispers and echoes from the past. Generalizations such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are like broad strokes on a blank canvas, oversimplifying the intricate dance of human nature.\n\nTo approach the negotiating table with an understanding of culture is to step into a strange land, where the familiar seems alien and the alien, familiar. It is not about passing judgment or imposing one's own standards, but about acceptance and accommodation. When one finds oneself in a culture foreign to their own, one must navigate its labyrinthine paths with respect and humility, especially when the ground beneath their feet is uncertain.\n\nThe borders of culture are not drawn by mere national or international boundaries. Within the heart of any society lies a myriad of corporate cultures, each with its own rhythm and language. A culture may be seen in the dress of its employees, the tone of their communications, the way they delegate tasks. Some cultures celebrate philanthropy, others restrict it to approved causes. The American corporate landscape is a patchwork of such cultures, from the towering skyscrapers of New York to the sprawling suburbs of the Midwest.\n\nBut it is the values of a culture that truly matter. They are the heartbeat of a society, the reason behind every decision, every action. If a culture values harmony, then a negotiator must tread lightly, lest they cause a ripple that becomes a wave. If a culture prizes a hard bargain, then a negotiator must be ready to stand firm, to weather the storm. Understanding these values before the first words are spoken can be the difference between success and failure.\n\nYet, a negotiator should not stop at the surface level. To truly understand, one must delve deeper, to learn the personal stories that make up the fabric of a culture. It is in these personal narratives that the true heart of a culture lies.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" - Psalm 14, a verse echoed by St. Anselm in his quest to prove the existence of the Almighty. Aquinas, too, stands in this camp, defending the same deity in his own way. For the purpose of this discourse, let us assume both men are correct, for it is their belief in the God of the Bible that unites their arguments. We seek to compare their proofs, but first, we must acknowledge the limitations of our approach. To consider a divinity differing from the one they serve would muddy our waters, for they argue for this one, this specific God.\n\nAnselm's path is one of faith, of looking inward to find the truth of God. He posits that because God resides within our understanding, we cannot comprehend His nonexistence. This is a complex, meandering argument, but its essence is simple: the proof for God lies within our own minds. He suggests we need not venture beyond our souls to find truth, but that God's existence is evident to us, inherently known. This is the essence of faith, an acceptance of unseen evidence.\n\nAquinas, however, walks a different path. He believes God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This would be a boon for the Church, as it would allow for conversion without reliance on unwavering belief. Aquinas sets forth five logical arguments supporting his claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each demonstrates that the proof for God lies in the logical necessity for Him. If one piece of a puzzle is missing, one can deduce its features and existence without seeing it.",
            "In the dim light of a fifth or sixth century BCE dawn, a prince was born who would one day be known as the Buddha. His journey led him to renounce the world and find enlightenment, leaving teachings that would give birth to Buddhism, the most ancient sect known as Theravada. Twenty-five hundred years have passed, and the religion has changed, as can be seen in the annual water-cutting ceremony celebrated in Sri Lanka, a land of Theravada. Monks and laymen alike participate, though Buddha himself never taught such a rite. This is but a symptom of the myriad changes that have taken place, from the outward traditions to the very heart of the religion's doctrine. Both the monastic and lay communities have altered their doctrinal principles over time, shaped by forces both from within and without, some hostile, others benign.\n\nWe shall make frequent use of certain terms: internal and external forces, the former wielded by the Buddha's own, regardless of their monastic status, the latter by those who are not Buddha's. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or damage the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces, while not wishing harm, may inadvertently cause it. These terms shall recur throughout this discourse.\n\nFirst, we must examine the core of the religion, the tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Seekers of the path find refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, with its rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, delving into Buddhism's metaphysical notions, such as Anatta, no self, Dukkha, inherent suffering, and Anicca, impermanence. Recognizing these concepts leads one from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and the cessation of lobha, desire, dosa, hatred, and moha, delusion, when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, five for laymen (I shall not kill, nor lie, nor steal, nor misbehave sexually, nor take intoxicants) and many more for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the four noble truths: life is suffering, attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The lands of America and Mexico, once bound in a ceaseless strife that spanned half a century, from 1836 to 1893, bore witness to a rivalry that would leave its mark on both nations. The apex of this enmity was the Mexican-American War, a conflict that saw the United States emerge victorious, securing Texas and the American Southwest as its own. Other skirmishes, though less catastrophic, still marked the border, a testament to the enduring nature of this rivalry. The strife between these two nations began with differences in faith, culture, and tradition, and was further fueled by mutual material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis animosity is not unique to these two lands. Nations that share a border often find themselves in disputes over territory and resources, as if the very earth itself is a contentious matter. The United States and Mexico are but two among many who have known this fate, with David M. Pletcher (1977) noting that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). The proximity of these nations to the United States, and their shared history, have made them constant rivals, unlike other nations in Latin America which have enjoyed more harmonious relations.\n\nThe roots of the rivalry can be traced back to religious differences, a theme that has echoed through history. Sally Frahm (2001) observes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). The ideological clashes between the United States and Mexico were born of this religious divide, a mistrust that ran deep, rooted in the historic enmity between the English and Spanish. This legacy of distrust was a formidable obstacle in forging amiable relations between the two nations.\n\nThe period of this rivalry, as documented by Diehl and Goerts (2000), saw 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States. The majority of these disputes were territorial in nature, stemming from border raids and other frontier issues. Outlaws and bandits from American towns would cross the border, causing chaos and discord, a problem that persisted until both nations exerted their military might to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). The rivalry began to wane as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen winters ago, a spectral malady struck, and I was felled by an ailment that had never whispered its name to me. I was a nurse, drawn to the job by a desperate hunger for refuge, a sanctuary that childhood had denied me. \"You'll always find a place in the world, for sickness is constant,\" they said, and so, I chose the path less desired, the one that others deemed secure.\n\nYet here I am, at forty-six and alone, penniless, and unable to earn a living. The years have passed, and still, the illness holds me in its iron grip. After fifteen years of subsistence on Social Security Disability, I am bereft, stripped bare of all that was once mine. Each day is a battle, a relentless onslaught against the security, the safety, and the self-worth that once were my shields.\n\nLet me tell you this, there will always be calamities, great and small, that will befall us. Not a single one can be warded off, nor overcome, without the aid of others. It is a harsh truth, but one I know from experience.\n\nI acknowledge the need for reform, to ceasingly trust in the faltering beast that is our government. But I yearn for something more, a return to the days when we trusted in one another, when we reached out a hand and asked for help. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies, they did not do so alone. They relied on one another, on compassion and mutual respect, and the sharing of what little they had.\n\nSo, be prepared, yes. I have my provisions, my supplies, my stash of candles and matches, my cans of food. If you have the land and the will, tend to your own food source, build your own hearth, but as you do so, look around.

            "The question of why organisms evolve as they do‭—‬Are there limitations or constraints that guide the path of evolutionary change‭? ‬In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson observed that even the simplest organic forms elude precise mathematical description. Yet, in our contemporary epoch, mathematical modeling has embraced the complexity of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing its trajectory through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬cf.‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our investigation into Prunum, a genus of mollusk, seeks to unravel the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change by intertwining mathematical modeling with empirical study. Utilizing X-radiographic images, we have identified quantitative parameters that, like the constellations, chart the path of hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters are fed into CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬, a software program that models these trajectories. Our hypothetical shell morphologies delineate the bounds of possible morphological transformations, and these findings converge with experimental and descriptive studies to illuminate macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nConsider the shell as a serpentine tube that winds through three hundred and sixty degrees of space, its convolutions known as whorls, which coil around an imaginary axis, the columella. The pace of whorl enlargement varies, with a continuous line separating each, called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, the body whorl, is the last. The spire consists of all whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through a portal called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nCounting whorls begins by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and noting the first suture's beginning. A line divides the shell into two halves, and counting commences from this point, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be perceived as a series of temporal and spatial apertures, a path traced by the coordinates of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once formulated, parameters can be varied, and the mollusk's skeletogenesis can be modified.",
            "In the realm of the archipelago of Indonesia, the specter of neonatal and infant mortality has remained an unyielding scourge for a decade past. Though the nation has much to be proud of in its pursuit of Millennium Development Goals, with strides made in water and sanitation, the scourge of maternal and child health remains a blight upon the land. This decay is a testament to the need for a robust health system, rather than the mere application of band-aid programmatic interventions.\n\nThe birth rate in the presence of skilled health workers has seen an uptick, now reaching 72% of all births. Yet, this measure is a double-edged sword, for it includes traditional midwives who cannot offer medical remedies should complications arise. As a result, the specter of maternal death looms large, born of hemorrhage. The treatment of diarrheal cases in children under five has seen a decline, as has postnatal care, which remains largely unrecorded but no less problematic.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low at 4%, with a stark disparity between urban and rural areas. In the cities, the rate stands at 7%, a stark contrast to the 2% in the countryside. This inequity is a reflection of the prioritization of urban healthcare, leaving the rural dwellers to fend for themselves. The gulf between the poorest and richest quintiles in healthcare utilization stands at a staggering 27%. The poor, it seems, are left to languish in the shadows, their plight exacerbated by the high costs of out-of-pocket expenditure.\n\nAs we look towards the horizon of improvement in neonatal and maternal care, the most pressing question remains: how to best combat the endemic lack of service? Should Indonesia focus on targeted programmatic approaches, or strengthen the overall health system? There is no denying the allure of programmatic solutions, with their clear, manageable objectives and swift results. Yet, the shadow they cast is long, for they can lead to a dearth of funding for other sectors and a hive mentality of human resources drawn to the area with the most resources.\n\nMoreover, the proliferation of such programs can lead to a labyrinth of duplicated services, uncoordinated and mired in the quagmire of forms and paperwork. It is a conundrum, a predicament that demands a delicate balance between targeted intervention and systemic improvement.",
            "Victorian novels, a labyrinth of intricate detail and the gilded world of the nobility, find their echoes in Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, two works that, like strange outliers, bear an air of mystery and the exotic. These novels, though, are more akin to surrealist canvases, where the bizarre and the enigmatic dance with the characters, lending them an eerie depth that illuminates their true selves. The former, in particular, employs such elements through dreamlike states, a technique that reveals Oliver's inner turmoil, his anguish, and the truth of his circumstances.\n\n\"Now, a host of bewildering and confusing thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to walk again between Sikes and Crackit, their voices echoing in his ears, as if the words were still being spoken. He found himself conversing with them, the very air heavy with their angry dispute. Suddenly, a report shattered the air, and a cacophony of shouts and lights flooded his vision. An unseen hand bore him away, through a maelstrom of noise and tumult. A constant, undefined pain gnawed at him, a torment that refused to wane, even as he was carried through the chaos.\"\n\nThe shooting, a pivotal moment revisited in chapter 28, is relived by Oliver as if in a dream, his struggle to find aid starkly depicted. The lack of control he feels over the events that unfold is stark, his health's dire state evident in the hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit, his senses numbed as he is borne away. The shooting itself is a relentless agony, his despair eternal, untainted by the initial shock of pain. Instead, fear and hopelessness reign supreme. The question remains, whose will brought about his misfortune? Certainly not his own. This shooting underscores his powerlessness, his inability to control his fate, even when his life hangs in the balance. A growing despondency is implied, as if old Fagin's influence has begun to break him, reducing his capacity to react, forcing him to accept this despair.\n\n\"The day... or was it a day? It passed as swiftly as it came, and night arrived, long and silent, yet fleeting in its endless dance. Night, a relentless specter, brought with it an endless, dreadful silence, and yet, it was gone as quickly as it had come.\"",
            "A few years back, I found myself in an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. I aimed to assist them in their struggles, whatever the subject may be, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One youngster named Adrian, whom I believed to be in the third or fourth grade, presented a peculiar challenge—he had significant trouble reading. It became clear that something was amiss; he could pronounce certain letters perfectly while others were entirely foreign to him. His strange predicament, somewhat puzzling, was further complicated by the fact that he was of Latino descent yet spoke perfect English. Our toils continued until one fateful day when his mother walked in. She spoke only Spanish, and my meager grasp of that language forced us to communicate in a manner akin to a code. That day, it dawned on me: Adrian could read, but he was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. Though I cannot say if this revelation bore much fruit, I hope Adrian has since improved.\n\nI recount this tale to shine a light on the language barrier in our schools, particularly in California. It serves to demonstrate that the issue is not always as apparent as one might think. Even a child fluent in English can face immense obstacles when it comes to reading. We all acknowledge this problem, so what is the solution? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, specifically the alphabet and pronunciation, proved effective. But for those with barely a grasp of English, the solution is much more intricate. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes is needed.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system holds great promise. Not only for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research has shown that children in such programs outperform their peers academically. However, much fear and concern surround this idea, with some believing it to be a waste of resources. This is a false notion; if implemented widely, all children would benefit. But how do we achieve this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unrealistic. Yet, I propose that we employ bilingual aids or tutors to bridge the gap.",
            "From cradle to grave, we are whispered tales of an enigmatic force that dwarfs our own comprehension. Some of us are led to Sunday schools, others to temples, and still more delve into their own souls for answers. Many embrace the faith passed down, while others reject it, denying the existence of anything beyond our narrow self-interest. We vacilate, shifting our values as if they were mere sandcastles at the mercy of the tide. Yet, we all embark on a pilgrimage to define ourselves, each seeking our own peculiar light in the dark.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my pa said, when I pressed him on his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming against the tin roof overhead, our cigarettes flickering in the gloom. The gutters were swollen, washing away the remnants of the once-proud plants. He stared into the rain, eyes distant, recalling or perhaps searching for something lost. His frame had grown gaunt, clothes hanging slack, hair thin and gray. Our eyes met not, his gaze flicking away like a flight of birds. I felt adrift, fearful, and silent, for speaking would only make the inevitable more real. I embraced him, retreated, and drew my chair closer to his, both gazing into the falling rain of June's dusk.\n\nBy December, my pa was gone, five days after my twenty-second year's mark. Chemo and radiation did little to ease his suffering, merely prolonging it beyond the doctors' predictions. What purpose served this cruel extension, I pondered in the quiet of night.

            "The antiquated \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt elucidates in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is a curious oxymoron, a fusion of \"Old\" and \"New.\" Praised and reviled in equal measure, it was condemned for lacking true substance and lauded for its evocation of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). At its genesis, the Gothic mode was born of the union of ancient and modern romances, as seen in Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole, in his \"Gothic Story,\" employed elements both old—theatrical trappings—and new—the novel's personal introspection—to forge a path uncharted. The Gothic, with its echoes of medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, was viewed as a relic, archaic and unsophisticated amidst the heady advances of modern society. Yet, it persists, obsolete and new, a paradox that resonates through time.\n\nOne tenet that permeates the Gothic is the concept of Chivalry. In its essence, it is the training of a proper knight, a remnant of medieval ideals, yet transmuted in Walpole's work. Walpole, in the throes of political turmoil and personal despair, may have seen in the chivalric ideal a morality and goodness lost in the present. Through characters like Frederic, he ideals of the chivalric past are romanticized, hinting at the evolving Gothic to Romanticism. Frederic, a prince, is described thus:\n\n\"The gallant and courteous Knight,\" his figure exaggerated, embodying the Gothic trope of excess.",
            "Supply chain management, a labyrinth of processes that weaves together the threads of a business, from the loom of customer orders to the rafters of raw materials, and down through the silos of production and distribution, until it reaches the customer's doorstep. The term, coined in '82 by a consultant named Keith Oliver, is a cipher for the art of planning, executing, and governing the flow of goods and information to satisfy the fickle beast that is the modern consumer. Six pillars support this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nThe first of these, production, is the crucible of the entire process. It is here that decisions are forged, like iron in a furnace, to answer the questions: When? Why? Where? And how? The manager must divine the desires of the market, a fickle creature that shifts like sand. Once the market's heart is understood, the manager can decide what to produce and how much. The choice of where to produce, and which forge to use, is crucial; it must balance volume with quality, and always keep the customer's satisfaction at the forefront. Only then can the manager set about scheduling workloads and maintaining the machinery.\n\nThe second pillar, supply, is a strategic dance of decisions, like a chessmaster playing a game of life and death. It involves determining the core strengths of a facility and negotiating with outsourced partners. A factory may have many divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose which division is best suited for each process. Outsourcing may also be an option, to gain velocity - the ability to provide quality and flexibility while keeping costs low. But remember, every decision echoes down the line, and a wrong move can bring the whole chain crashing down.",
            "In the sultry, dust-choked streets of Rangoon, a sign clings to a wall, a stark declaration: Hitler lives, whispered by the shadows of the past that cling to this land. A lone figure stands there, Ellen Page, her eyes haunted, her fingers gripping a scrap of cardboard. Burma, where the colors of the robes worn by the monks are a beacon of hope, yet the red blood they spill is a grim testament to the power that rules here.\n\nThe air is thick with the stench of corruption and the echo of silence. The junta has held its grip for decades, their thirst for power unquenched. In '62, they seized the reins of government in a coup, and now, they hold their people in an iron grasp. Monks, the spiritual heart of the country, took to the streets, their robes a sea of saffron against the dark tide of oppression. The Saffron Revolution, they called it, a desperate cry for freedom. But the junta, they crushed the spirit of the monks, their monasteries turned into battlegrounds, their sanctity defiled.\n\nForeign eyes were not welcome here. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, paid the ultimate price, his death a chilling warning to all who would dare to look closer at the reality beneath the surface. The official death toll? A mere 13, a number that pales in the face of Colonel Hla Win's defiant truth: \"Many more have fallen. The bodies can be counted in countless thousands.\"\n\nThis is not a new dance. The beast of tyranny has danced through history, from the Roman emperors who claimed god-like power, to the Japanese who believed their rulers descended from the gods themselves, to our own land, where a president stands tall with a man who preaches the gospel of stupidity. Tiananmen Square, a blood-soaked square, where the spirit of dissent was met with the iron fist of the government. The Rwandan genocide, where the stench of death filled the air as Hutu militia groups, with the government's blessing, began their grim work. And Hitler's Third Reich, a dark stain on the history of man, where the Jewish people were rounded up like cattle, their lives snuffed out like candles in the wind.\n\nBut the spirit of the monks, the silent protest of Ellen Page, the echoes of voices silenced, they persist. They are the ghosts of the past, the harbingers of a future where the light of freedom triumphs over the dark tide of oppression.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz is woven with the threads of his endurance and the creative tapestry he wove for his ensemble. His touch on the piano is a quiet, almost unassuming presence in many of his compositions, yet as a composer, he excelled in crafting rich, intricate pieces that allowed each band member to shine like a beacon. Ellington created a framework wherein a soloist could wander freely, writing passages that leaned on the particular tone and style of each member to illuminate the music's core. His mastery of each player's voice, and how they blended into a cohesive whole, led him to pen some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its examination of Ellington's sound and innovation, points to \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This early composition, a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues, showcases Ellington's ability to add texture and color without lyrics, and to complement the style of his soloists. The piece unfolds in six choruses, each a microcosm of Ellington's genius:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning smooth and melodic, then morphing into a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus in a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, as the reeds begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds, the voice now growling like an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a layer of tonal complexity to this piece is but one instance of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington weaves his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing marries the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, as Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone.\n\nEllington's ability to mold the unique voices of his musicians into a cohesive, innovative sound is a testament to his genius.",
            "She'd always felt a gnawing emptiness, a hunger that gnawed at her soul. It began when she was fourteen, as the world turned its eyes on her, and it remained, a yearning that refused to abate. At seventeen, she no longer sought things; she yearned for a connection, yet no boy had ever stirred her. Some had tried, their clumsy overtures a dance of desperation, but none had been successful. She questioned this strange absence, plaguing her mind with theories that amounted to little more than whispers in the dark.\n\nHer home was usually a sanctuary, a place of quiet calm. Her father and mother were a pair of silent sentinels, their voices soft as the wind through the trees. Arguments were rare, their daughter's spirit a storm that did not break their truce. Yet, today was not like the others. As she wandered, seeking some new spark in her life, she heard it - a cry, sharp as a blade, her mother's voice echoing in pain. She rushed, her heart a drum in her chest, to find her mother lying on the floor, her breath coming in short gasps. \"Mama?\" she cried, her voice a plea. \"What's wrong?\"\n\nHer mother's face was a mask of pain, her eyes swimming with tears. \"Sweetheart,\" she whispered, her voice a fractured thing. \"Hospital. Need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter nodded, a fierce determination in her eyes. She was her strength, her mother's shield. She carried her to the car, her muscles burning, and drove. The hospital was a place of antiseptic and fear, but she did not see it. Her mind was a whirlwind of worry, her heart a drumbeat of dread.\n\nThe vase. Her mother had fallen from the step stool, reaching for the vase. A simple thing, a moment's misstep, and yet it had brought her to this. She waited, her heart a drum in her chest, as the doctors swarmed around like vultures.",
            "This investigation sought to demonstrate that adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as evidenced by a high \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) diet score, is correlated with a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a variant of the Med diet, emphasizes higher consumption of plant foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, alongside monounsaturated fats and fish, while restricting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permissible.\n\nPrevious studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and both total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, with intervention trials revealing the Med diet's superiority over low-fat diets in facilitating weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. Prior investigations did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, with no history of CVD or diabetes, participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a 121,700 female nurse cohort across 11 US states. Over six intervals, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses remained participants throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Incident CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke cases were confirmed through medical, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were evaluated for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity assessed beginning in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (by averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) through adjustments for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile exhibited a reduced risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annus mirabilis of 2007, the once-great United States of America found itself mired in a financial quagmire that would leave the nation reeling for years to come. The specter of unemployment loomed large, the housing market teetered on the brink of collapse, and many of the nation's most formidable corporations were left desolate and unyielding. This calamity, which still echoes through the halls of power, begs the question: what transpired to bring about this catastrophe, and how might we avert such a calamity in the future?\n\nThe seeds of this calamity were sown in the halcyon days of the Clinton reign, as the President sought to secure a second term by appeasing the masses. To this end, the administration loosened the reins on lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes, of the New York Times, foretold the impending doom in 1999: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" He would go on to prophecy, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nMany factors conspired to send the nation into a tailspin, but chief among them was the labyrinthine structure of mortgages that had been constructed. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) entwined the nation's financial markets in a complex and perilous web. This, in turn, left households and financial institutions alike dangerously exposed to the housing market's whims.\n\nIndeed, the housing market's bubble burst, and the institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities found themselves spurned. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, a staggering sum that accounted for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a fraction of their worth, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to assume the mantle of commercial banks, subject to the iron fist of regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under the watchful eye of the government in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That dark, abysmal realm where the writer's pen doth drown in the mire of mundane details, birthing a tale as lifeless as the corpses it describes. It is the bane of the writer's existence, a scourge that can either captivate or bore the reader to the point of death. Dr. Merlin herself has cried out in anguish before her monitor, her voice echoing through silent halls as she finds herself adrift in the sea of Too Much Information, a voyage fraught with nary a whisper of the thrilling narrative she had intended to craft.\n\nExposition is no friend of the writer, yet it is an evil that must be vanquished. My gentle readers already know the holy writ, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in the coils of exposition's serpentine embrace, in other words, in the miry clay of excessive prose.\n\nExposition is the teller of tales, the narrator who spills the beans, the one who informs us of the past without the benefit of sensory input. In film, exposition is the monologue, the outpouring of information from one character to another, akin to the ballad of the ancient mariner. In fiction, it is the author's voice that speaks the words, the stage upon which the actor of the past doth dance.\n\nConsider, if you will, a tale of a heroine and her beloved. 'Twas told that they met at such a place and time, that they wed in grand ceremony, and that her husband was slain before her very eyes. Wouldst thou expect this tale to span two pages, in which neither uttered more than two words? Nay, the author doth owe the reader a feast of words, a banquet of characters, a symphony of emotions. The husband's love should be evidenced in his speech and manner, and the heroine's heart should be laid bare in the smallest of gestures, so that thou mightst mourn with her and grow to love her as thou wouldst love thyself.\n\nIn short, thou must provide flesh to the bones of thy story, for 'tis not enough to merely say that they met, they wed, he died. The reader craves more, dear heart, more than the simple truth. They crave the tale that will make their hearts flutter, their souls stir, their blood boil. They crave the tale that will make them weep, that will make them laugh, that will make them feel alive.\n\nSo, when thou findest thyself tempted to rush past certain things, to mention the Air Force days of a gas station manager, the two failed marriages, the secret dreams of owning the station and the breakfast of champions, remember this: the reader doth not want a list. They want a story. A story that will make them care, that will make them feel, that will make them remember long after the last page is turned.",
            "I beheld two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, one a live affair, the other a mere echo. NBC 4 they called it, and the first tale they spun was of a man in Ashley, Ohio, who'd plunged a blade into his wife's flesh. Evil did not mar his visage, yet pure malice gleamed from his eyes. Two minutes they gave him, no more, as the tale was still unraveling.\n\nAnother story, of a young man named Travis Buyers, shot down in Sharon Woods, his life hanging by a thread. No arrests, no suspects, the SWAT team prowled the woods. The tale was brief, almost as if the color of his skin, or the hue of the neighborhood, dictated its length.\n\nA gunshot through the Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle, it seemed. Five thousand dollars they offered, for a lead to the shooter. The weather forecast followed, thunder and rain, temperatures mid-eighties. A teaser, they called it, to keep the audience glued to the screen.\n\nA robbery at Clime Road UDF, a dark-skinned man in a hoodie, six feet tall, one-fifteen pounds heavy. The tale they spun, a dance of detail, the color of his skin the rhythm, a strange beat.\n\nA drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic man, twenty-five years in prison. But they spoke of three hundred months, as if the weight of the sentence might be lost in the arithmetic. His skin, his origin, they said, as if they felt it necessary.",
            "There is a bond between brothers, an unyielding, unbroken bond. Within this bond, emotions swirl like dark waters: love, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Brothers see in one another their own reflections, and in the direst of circumstances, the true nature of this bond is laid bare, whether it be for good or ill. The cost of understanding these emotions is steep, for they carry with them a heavy burden. When one gazes into the eyes of their brother, they see not what others see, but what they truly are. In their actions and the repercussions thereof lies their true character.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers navigate this theme, and the raging emotions that accompany it. Through a landscape lush and vividly described, these two boys embark on a hopeless journey. Bitter resentment and intense pride collide in the climactic scene, and only one brother survives the ordeal. The theme is expressed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's point of view, which elucidates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him, both of which shape his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first venture together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother to teach all his worldly skills, to run, jump, climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp, to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. But Doodle's frail heart made these dreams impossible. He was born with a heart so weak that it was unlikely he would even survive, let alone participate in such vigorous activities. What a bitter blow to the young protagonist's wild fantasies! He even contemplates suffocating Doodle with a pillow, a child's dark secret. Yet, when Doodle smiles at him, hope is kindled, and his resolve weakens. His heart, despite his anger, contains an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the annals of mortal intellect, the brain is an intricate, labyrinthine tapestry, woven with threads of thought and information. As the arc of technological progress unfurls, so too have the metaphors spawned to describe the ineffable workings of our minds. From the ancient wax tablet to the parchment scroll, from the bound volume to the machine, each metaphor has its utility and its limitations.\n\nThe dance of perception commences with the humble sensors, which translate the exterior world into electrochemical whispers. This symphony of signals, both ascending and descending, is the brain's ballet. In the example of a black box against a white expanse, the bottom-up process assembles the simplest of elements - hue, alignment, and perimeter - to declare the presence of a box. The top-down, however, emboldens this recognition, imbuing the object with significance - a black box, not a hollow in the void.\n\nThe sieve of attention, ever vigilant, sifts and selects. While the brain may feast on the minutiae of a field of grass, it discards the inconsequential, allowing us to hear our own name in a clamor of noise. This dance of cognition is a delicate choreography, where the fruits of perception are repeatedly refined and moderated by the filter of attention.\n\nInformation, to be processed, must first be captured. The brain's memory is a vast repository, its contents encoded in myriad ways. The visual, the auditory, the verbal - each has its own cipher. In the realm of long-term memory, the structure of proteins is postulated to maintain our enduring thoughts. The organization of this knowledge is a matter of debate, with models ranging from the retrieval patterns of humans to the algorithms of the machine, each offering a different lens through which to view the mind's vast landscape.",
            "In the grim pages of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a dystopian vision unfurls, a critique of the encroaching tide of technology and the capitalist structure that supports it. The society depicted here values community above the individual, and from the cradle to the grave, its citizens are conditioned to pursue immediate gratification above all else. They are little more than pawns in a grand game, their ideologies shaped by the iron will of the World Controller. Through the lens of Marxist thought, Huxley's novel reveals a deep-seated suspicion of the systems that govern us, with terms like homogeny and reification reinforcing the notion that this is a commentary on the flaws inherent in the emerging economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism, in Huxley's vision, is a beast that feeds on the false consciousness of its subjects. The common folk are blinded by their own desires, unable to see the true nature of their economic relations. They are, as Marx would put it, \"falsely conscious,\" their interests manipulated by the ruling class. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, and the like, have no will of their own, their desires for consumption and indulgence stoked by the hypnopædia, a tool of the World Controller. Hegemony, the dominance of one class over another, is writ large in this world, as the lower classes are unaware of their own oppression, buying into an ideology that supports their own exploitation. The upper classes, the Alphas and Betas, are born into this knowledge, yet few act against it, accepting their place in the hierarchy.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and superficial, a reflection of the society's devaluation of personal expression. Love and deep emotion are absent, replaced by a focus on physical appearance and trivial encounters. The characters, even the major ones, lack depth, their interactions reduced to mere transactions. This is a society where the rise of technology and capitalism has stripped individuals of their free will and expression.\n\nThe obedience of each class to their place in the hierarchy is a symptom of this socioeconomic oppression. They are false proletariats, convinced of their own superiority so long as they consume, obey, and conform to the expectations of their peers. This is the world Huxley presents to us, a chilling mirror of our own times, a warning whispered in the cold wind of a dystopian future.",
            "In this land of towering edifices and sprawling expanses, I've worn the path of the student for nigh on two and three-quarters years. The University Park sprawls vast and wild, a beast that devours time and stamina in equal measure. My freshman year found me ensconced in the farthest reaches of East Halls, a sanctuary of solitude where the winds howl and the shadows grow long. To traverse this kingdom from my humble abode to the heart of the campus, where the Willard building stands tall and proud, would take the stout-hearted half an hour, if the elements were not conspired against me in their myriad forms. Speak with the aged and the wise, and they'll tell you of times when the East Halls were isolated, separated from the rest of the school by vast, untamed lands. Now, those same lands have been tamed, filled with the hum of activity, the clatter of construction, the scent of new growth. Yet, as the campus swells, so does the burden of navigating its ever-changing landscape.\n\nA bicycle, they say, is the answer to this conundrum. Yet, a bicycle alone will not suffice. It requires a willing rider, and a campus that bends to its needs. I've spoken with a friend, a man who'd abandoned his steed for a time, who now marvels at the simplicity of it all. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"they're the only way to make sense of this place.\" And indeed, they are. A hearty breakfast and a little sweat can see you through the longest of journeys. I, too, have succumbed to the allure of the bicycle. My abode off-campus, like the dorms it once surpassed, stands at the edge of this kingdom. Yet, a bike has made the distance bearable. The Thomas building, a mere twenty minutes' walk away, is now but five minutes' ride. Yet, Pollock Road, the straightest path to my destination, is not without its trials. The wind and the inclines, they would test the mettle of any man or machine. And so, I walk, but only when necessity dictates. For time is a precious commodity, and I've learned to cherish it. To spend an extra half-hour each day walking, when I could be learning, is a sacrifice I'm unwilling to make. A bike, it seems, is not merely a mode of transport, but a way of life. And in this kingdom of academia, it's a way of life I've come to embrace."
