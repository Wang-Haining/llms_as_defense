            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I intend to tread a path that leads me to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I shall endeavor to lend aid to those children who have been afflicted by the scourge of abuse and neglect, and to offer support to those families beset by discord. The values that I bring to this endeavor are not mere abstractions but the very essence of my being: service, respect, and a steadfast commitment to the ethical pursuit of improvement in human relationships and my own professional competency. These are not merely the values of a social worker but the cornerstone of my own existence.\n\nI have always been a man possessed of a desire to alleviate the suffering of others, yet the path to this end was obscured by the fog of uncertainty. Throughout my sojourn through high school and college, I have beheld many a soul retreating from their plight in the mire of denial, and a few who have succumbed to false securities. It was this tableau of despair that prompted me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, yet the path to a career remained elusive. Thus, I took a respite upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One sultry summer's day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old lad, his demeanor as anxious as his circumstances. He sought refuge from an abusive home, and I could not turn away from his plight. The next day, I found myself at his parent's doorstep, a stranger bearing a degree in Psychology. The police were powerless, and so I engaged the parents in a conversation that revealed their hearts to be as beaten and bruised as their son's. This encounter seeded the seed of a career in social work, a means to tend to the wounds of family strife.\n\nSocial justice is a value that resonates deeply within me, for our society holds the individual in high esteem, yet we are bound by the chains of conformity. If we mourn the loss of an individual, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual, and I will not be shackled by the expectations of others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I have protested against the injustices that bind us, coloring my hair with the bold hues of defiance, donning attire that reflects my true self, piercing my ears with the rebellion of my spirit, and declaring my alliance with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance. I have fought against racism and discrimination, for I believe in the sanctity of the individual and the justice that is their due. I will continue to stand against the injustices that plague our society, for I am an individual, and I will not be silenced.",
            "The following compendium traverses the labyrinthine terrain of Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model, like a grim sentinel, stands watch over the inheritance of genetic information and the physiological aspects of health. In stark contrast, the Sociocultural model casts its gaze upon environmental relationships, their reach extending to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia is a sojourn through these models, each step illuminated by the research chosen to illuminate them, and each finding subjected to a critical eye.\n\nSleep disorders, in their myriad forms, can be characterized as primary, related to another mental disorder, or connected to other issues. The primary sleep disorders, such as Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, stand as the first line of defense against the encroaching darkness of sleeplessness. Those related to mental disorders are but shadows cast by Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders, like ghosts in the night, are born of medical complications or the specter of substance intake. Dyssomnias, with their focus on initiation and maintenance of sleep, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). In the realm of Parasomnias, the nightmares and terrors that beset the sleeping are the haunting echoes of behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders, a grim litany of genes and heritable factors, delves into the physiologically acquired aspects. In the deep, dark chasm of the hypothalamus, neurons containing orexin regulate the dance of sleep and wakefulness. A study of mice, in the language of science, revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, responsible for the states of sleep and wakefulness. The activation of the GABAA receptor, like a soothing lullaby, brings forth sleep. Inhibition of this receptor, as if the silence of a haunted house, reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The application of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time, a beacon of hope in the darkness (Matsuki et al., 2009). This study, like a map to the promised land, implies that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This suggests a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence in this receptor could hinder the ability to sleep unaided by medication. The sociocultural implications, like the echo of a gunshot in the night, suggest that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep. An alteration of the receptor, a glitch in the matrix, would disturb sleep, casting a shadow over the individual's life, tainting their days with the monotony of sleeplessness and the struggle to focus.",
            "The travail of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) unfolds in realms beyond mere audibility. It is not an affliction of the ears, but a malady of the mind, a fracture in the central nervous system's ability to harness and decipher auditory information. The brain, that labyrinthine organ, fails in its duty to translate sound into meaning, leaving those stricken with CAPD to grapple with a world that echoes without substance.\n\nThe origins of this condition can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when researchers first began to unravel the mysteries of \"auditory imperception.\" The path of discovery was marked by the pioneering efforts of researchers like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who in 1954 began to develop tests for children with communicative disorders, and later, by Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing and his model of the physiological activity underlying auditory perception in 1961. A gathering of luminaries in 1977 further fueled the fires of research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of the disorder vary in their cruelty. The afflicted may find it impossible to pinpoint the source of a sound, or to differentiate between acoustic events. They may struggle to recognize patterns in sound, to parse the subtle shifts in speech that betray sarcasm, or to decipher the sequence in which auditory information is presented. Some may find their thoughts disrupted by the intrusion of subsequent sounds.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a complex endeavor, requiring the keen eye and skilled hand of audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. It involves a myriad of tests and measures, from questionnaires and observations to advanced recordings of acoustic signals within the ear. Yet, despite these efforts, a single tool of diagnostic certainty remains elusive, and the root cause of CAPD remains shrouded in mystery.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to imply that, whilst disguise may prove expedient in the art of long deception, it is ultimately a double-edged blade. For, in the inevitable unmasking, a person risks losing their true self. Such a predicament presents a conundrum: the choice between self-preservation and the preservation of relationships, for some may bear the deception with neutrality, whilst others will be offended and seek retribution.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly thorny, for it raises questions of identity and purpose. Why, then, does a person feel the need to shed their true form and don the guise of the opposite sex? In Viola's case, it is clear: a means of self-preservation. With her arrival in a strange land, she conceals her true self to evade potential harm. Her plan succeeds, yet it also isolates her from women, severing a vital support. Worse still, her deception entangles her in romantic complications. Olivia, mistaking her for Sebastian, falls in love with Cesario, and Orsino's suppressed affections for Viola surface.\n\nThis, perhaps, is a progressive stance, but to the modern observer, \"Twelfth Night\" may be seen as a tale of how deception can unveil hidden emotions. Consider Olivia and Orsino's unexpressed desires, possibly stirred by the presence of Viola/Cesario. Is Olivia's love for Cesario rooted in her attraction to men, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? This is a question worth pondering, for Olivia's character seems to embody the shallow judgments of her time. This is evident in her swift changes of heart, from loving Cesario to regarding Viola as a sister.",
            "German colonial rule, in its harshness, is often remembered for the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama of South West Africa. Yet, the empire's broad sweep cannot be accounted for by a single brushstroke. The colonial machine was as varied as the terrain it sought to subjugate. Educational provisions across the colonies mirrored this diversity. When the British assumed control of German East Africa in 1919, they found a populace that was, for the most part, educated and literate. Similarly, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary observers. Yet, South West Africa (what is now Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively engaged in the education of natives, here the task was largely left to missionary societies, receiving scant support from the government. Instead, the colonial state poured resources into educating Europeans, establishing schools and regulating missionary endeavors. These policies left a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other colonies boasted literate African populations, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper intends to delve deeper, identifying these factors and focusing on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans.\nA plethora of literature exists on education under German colonial rule, much of it written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the colonial period. These early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems of the colonies. Later works, in English, expanded upon this discourse, comparing educational systems across the colonies and offering more detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out, comparing the two colonies and discussing the factors that accounted for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a key factor in shaping its educational system.\nSouth West Africa possessed a climate that was moderately temperate, though much of the territory was covered by arid desert. The European population reflected this relative hospitability. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded over the past century, encompassing a multitude of genres, each with its own labyrinth of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. To name a few, there's rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, each a realm unto itself. Among these, Heavy Metal rock, a genre birthed four decades past, stands as one of the most variegated and expressive. It is expressive, for it embraces a spectrum of emotions, albeit largely those that tread the darker path. It is diverse, too, as early pioneers recognized its adaptability, giving rise to an ever-branching tapestry of sub-genres.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has evolved into a vast, almost unfathomable, collection of niches. It has absorbed themes from other genres, yet its roots run deep. To comprehend the metal music that permeates our world today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement, and why it transcends mere genre classification.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement defined by its embrace of darkness. It is a music of extremes - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less simplicity, more virtuosity; metal musicians are true artisans, their skill evident in every note. It is also a movement with a heavy influence of psychedelic drugs. The mid-70s' drug boom led to a wave of 'crazy' records, the music an outlet for the artists' otherworldly experiences. It possesses a raw, visceral quality, a stark contrast to much of the music of the time, which often shied away from the darker spectrum of emotion. Later generations have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as these from Helter Skelter, by the Beatles, exhibit this darkness. Often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, it was a response to a Rolling Stones track, an attempt to match their heavier, darker sound. The Beatles, it seems, were eager to prove they could be just as heavy as the Stones.",
            "In the waning years of the nineteenth century, long before the Surrealists began to whisk their dreams onto canvas, a man named Henri Rousseau was weaving his own visions into his art. The Dream, a painting from 1910, is not merely a depiction of a woman captivated by a dreamt landscape, but a mirror to Rousseau's own aspirations and the turmoil that swirled within him. He yearned for acceptance, for praise, for a place among the esteemed artists he revered. Yet, he found himself at a crossroads, torn between the path of conformity and the lure of his own unique voice.\n\nTo truly understand The Dream, one must first delve into the life of this self-taught painter. Born in the bleak town of Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau hailed from humble beginnings, his father a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Formal art training eluded him, but he found his way into the world of art through his work as a gabelou, later living with the moniker douanier, a customs inspector. The death of his wife and eight children added to his burden, and he sought solace in painting, yearning for a new life.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance was not misplaced. He was late to the art world, uneducated in the intricacies of painting, and faced the daunting task of making his mark amidst a sea of talented contemporaries. It was only when his career was well underway that recognition began to surface, around the same time that Henri Matisse was making his name. Yet, there was a stark difference between these two painters, as noted by Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters. Matisse sought to avoid clichés, while Rousseau yearned for the conventional, hoping that his work, so ordinary, would gain him entry into the esteemed circle of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the shadowed corners of knowledge, many a sage has whispered of a union between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I hold that this nexus is not merely a coincidence, but a symbiosis as ancient as the earth itself. As Keats intones in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of life's wisdom is imparted through the schoolmaster's tongue or the fractious road, yet we find ourselves drawn to the ethical and the aesthetically pleasing without being led by these guides. Both ethics and aesthetics are but attempts to unravel the tapestry of existence, rather than to prescribe the colors on the loom. Our musings on morality and beauty are chiefly exercises in explication, not dictate.\n\nMore often than not, the critical eye fails to grasp the very essence of the good or the beautiful. A discourse on the Mona Lisa's worth may dwell upon such minutiae as fore and afterground, contrast's dance, or cultural context's sway, but in the end, these are but shadows cast by the masterpiece's light. True appreciation, it seems, begins with a whisper — \"There's just something...\" — before the more complex or critical explanation takes flight. Both art and morality, I believe, elude complete description. As O'Connor reminds us, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how meticulously we catalog a tome's properties, there remains a whisper of the ineffable. So too with morality.\n\nI postulate that the moral and the artistic are so intertwined because they strike us at a level both experienced and inexplicable, a realm that Kant would call noumenal. Their kinship is strongest in the art of literature. As McKean observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the resplendent heart of today's Germany, a coalescence of cultures unfurls, from the alpine shadows of München to the Baltic's embrace in Kiel. This tapestry, woven with threads of myriad hues, is felt from Köln by the Rhine, through the country's very soul, to the Saxon city of Dresden, whose Elbe river carves its path. Such an amalgamation of culture should not be a surprise, for Germany's formative years were shaped by the fusion of disparate sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the cradle of the German people, bears a name shrouded in mystery. Its origin is a matter of scholarly debate. Tacitus, in his work \"Germania,\" written in 98 AD, proposes that the name emerged from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who had previously been christened \"Germani.\" Others suggest the name derives from the Latin word \"germanus,\" used by Julius Caesar to distinguish between those he conquered, the Gauls, and those he did not, the Germanic tribes. Still others posit that the name may have come from the Old Irish \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' boisterous nature. Whatever the origin, the name has stuck, a testament to the enduring power of language.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et Situ Germanorum,\" penned, \"I should regard the Germans as aboriginal, and not mixed with other races. For, in former times, it was not by land but by sea that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.\" The Romans, too, were drawn to Germania, not for its warmth or grandeur, but for its goods and the skill of its warriors within their ranks. Thus, the Germanic tribes, appearing in the first century, found themselves living on the empire's borders, trading their wares and serving in the Roman legions.",
            "Downward my gaze fell, the tableau before me unspooling like a scroll, blank save for the stark lines of reality. Unlabeled, unvarnished, the scene took shape in my consciousness, a landscape of stark simplicity, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, a kitchen in a dining room, all reduced to mere lines and shapes by the unforgiving eye of my mind. Thoughts danced like spiders, weaving and unraveling in the quietude of my thoughts, each one a fleeting visitor, not quite leaving its mark. It was a dance of perception, a ballet of observation, and I was but the spectator, the silent witness to the world laid bare.\n\nBorn with a pencil in hand, I had long yearned to capture the world in lines and color, to wield the tool of creation. The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, a tome of wisdom bestowed upon me by an artist I once knew, had become my guide, a roadmap to the labyrinth of the mind where the pencil meets the canvas. It taught me to frame the world, to reduce the complexity of a scene to its most essential parts, to see the simple shape within the chaos.\n\nIn that moment, the bowl of fruit, the kitchen, the dining room, they were more than just a scene; they were a canvas, a landscape waiting for the brush of my perception. I was a painter, a sculptor, a creator, and before me lay the first brushstroke, the first line in my story, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched the handle of my chosen implement, a toilet brush, and the world shifted. The smooth water, the swirling vortex, it all became a canvas, a stage for the dance of my hand. I was the puppeteer, and the brush was my marionette, jerking and spasming, dancing in the rhythm of my will. The offending brown package, a testament to the folly of humanity, refused to yield, entrenched as a slug in the depths of the bowl.\n\nThe mop, a loose grip, a stance wide and steady, the green tie knotted against the collar of my shirt, all bore witness to my struggle. The rude bundle of processed matter, a message left for those who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid, was more than just a nuisance. It was a challenge, a test of my resolve, a reminder of the world's imperfections.\n\nMy hand moved, a slow descent, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey, a delicate dance with the abyss. And in that moment, I was not just a cleaner; I was an artist, a creator, a scribe of the world's imperfections.",
            "In the grim crucible of youth, young souls are claimed by the steel and asphalt, their lives snuffed out in the blink of an eye. The National Institutes of Health, in their unyielding pursuit of truth, have illuminated one aspect of this grim dance with death: the teen brain, in its formative state, is not yet equipped to navigate the perils of the open road. This naivety, this innocence, is as much a curse as it is a blessing. It is inexperience that lies at the heart of this calamity, a blindfolded child stumbling into a world of steel and speed.\n\nThe company of peers, a poisoned chalice, amplifies their folly. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has charted a grim correlation: more passengers, more accidents. California and other states have responded with provisional licenses, a Band-Aid on a bleeding wound. But these measures are but a temporary salve, for the truth is stark and unyielding: the youngest drivers, in their entirety, are not yet ready to bear the weight of responsibility.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman, in his cold, clinical gaze, has peered into the abyss and seen a desire for risk that burns bright and fierce. The thrill-seekers, they are called, these children of the digital age, and they are a plague upon the highways. It is wisdom, not folly, that would delay their descent into the crucible of the open road until the fever of youth has begun to subside.\n\nBy 2010, the children of the Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, a fresh wave of inexperienced drivers ready to plunge into the maelstrom. Legislation, it is whispered, could stem this tide. Driver's education in schools, the first steps on the path to wisdom, but no young soul under the age of eighteen should wield the keys to a motor vehicle. A provisional permit, a trial by fire, and a certain number of hours behind the wheel, the number determined by the majority of states. A uniform law, a beacon in the storm, guiding these young souls safely through the perils of the open road.\n\nThis is not a new idea, a fresh dawn. It is a truth whispered in the shadows, a truth that will not be denied.",
            "In perusing the Library of Congress's archive of Edison's earliest cinematic works, I encountered a clutch of fifteen trick films, dating from 1895 to 1901. These films, like their kin from that era, played with the eye's perceptions, employing creative editing to weave illusions. My study, much like a man unearthing ancient secrets, delved into the poetics of these deceptions, with an eye towards the peculiarities that bloomed in the latter years. The trick films of that time, much like the theatre they mimicked, were rooted in the stationary proscenium, with no camera movement, and adhered to the dictum that one shot equaled one film. Yet, there were renegades among them, daring to spurn these rules, introducing the notion of multiple shots.\n\nOne commonality that seeped through these films was their preference for interior sets, framed within a rigid proscenium. The camera, steadfast and unmoving, bore witness to the action that unfolded within its gaze. This, much like the theatre and vaudeville acts that preceded it, dictated the movement of actors, confining them to a horizontal axis. Consider, for instance, the dance of the actors in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). They entered from the right, moved back and forth, and exited, all without the camera's intervention.\n\nThe proscenium style also dictated that shots be long and, less frequently, medium. Close-ups were an anomaly, a stranger in that world. This, too, was a nod to the theatre, where the audience took in the entire performance at once, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors, much like the characters in these films, did not stray from the middle ground, never moving towards or away from the camera's cold eye.\n\nThe films, much like the theatre, often followed the rule that one conceptual shot equaled one film, limiting their duration to a minute or less. This also restricted their dramatic or narrative capabilities, most focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks. Yet, in these films, what the viewer saw as one shot was often a collage of several, the physical shots joined to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. In \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look reveals where the physical shot of Mary's \"head\" begins, though the entire film is perceived as one shot.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and steadfast advocate for the Republican cause. Born an agriculturalist, his life and brief foray into politics forged a man of unwavering dedication and outspoken convictions concerning personal liberties and governance. His deep-rooted belief in an agrarian system underpinned his views on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the young United States as an unparalleled opportunity to craft an ideal society, unencumbered by native traditions that might hinder progress. He revered the natural rights of men, asserting that they were interdependent, and that denying any one would diminish the value of the rest. These rights, he posited, should be beyond the government's grasp. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a harsh realm where the strong and cunning prospered, but civilized society must not replicate this brutality.\n\nTo achieve this utopia, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge and account for man's inherent good and evil. He held fast to a dualistic morality, claiming, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, he posited, protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government rooted in such principles would function equitably, regardless of administrative avarice and self-interest. While recognizing self-interest as man's primary motivation, he deemed it evil only when it subverted the creation of a society based on the public good.\n\nTaylor, like many of his time, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He yearned for a limited Federal government, with no powers beyond those explicitly stated. He understood that an expansive Federal government could become despotic. Yet, he cautioned against a simple, literal interpretation, as it could easily become corrupt without reference to the writers' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, for it more plainly described the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In reviewing Fig. 17, an abrupt decline in commuter log submissions became apparent in the third month of our project. This sudden drop was a discouraging sight, its cause shrouded in mystery. As winter descended upon our New England campus, fewer took to the roads on bicycle or foot, a natural explanation for some of the fall-off. December, too, brought the end of the fall semester - a time when students and faculty alike were engrossed in frantic preparations for the holidays and the processing of grades. Amidst this turmoil, the commuter log may have slipped from their minds. The holiday season, with its extended break, further diminished the need for campus attendance. Classes resumed in late January, perhaps accounting for the low February submissions. Yet none of this fully explains the February slump. It could be surmised that the project's initial fervor had waned, as such initiatives often do.\n\nTo combat this waning enthusiasm, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special blitz aimed at reinvigorating the project. This indeed resulted in an uptick in log submissions. The challenge, however, lay not only in maintaining the project's momentum but also in counteracting the inertia of holiday and semester breaks.\n\nAnother obstacle faced was the inherent allure of driving one's car, deeply ingrained in our culture. To encourage alternative commuting modes, we offered prizes - gift certificates to local eateries, an independent bookstore, and even national chain stores. The idea of larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, was intriguing but untested. If prizes had been increased gradually, say announcing bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, participation might have risen rather than dipped.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a form of security that tracks an index, commodity, or basket of assets much like an index fund, yet it trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification of an index fund coupled with the singular ownership benefits of a stock, such as short selling, margin buying, and the purchase of as little as one share. While these advantages are appealing, they come with a trade-off—ETFs typically charge a commission for each trade, akin to stock orders. Moreover, ETFs boast a wide array of funds, but a discerning investor should evaluate whether these stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent.\n\nFor our examination, we'll focus on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IHF) and compare it to its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of its total assets. Below are the top 10 holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, normalized to 100%. The results are as follows:\n\nFrom these calculations, it is evident that a portfolio composed solely of the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 points lower than the ETF's overall Beta. Thus, it appears that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns with a lower Beta. However, statistical significance between these two portfolios remains to be established.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios differ statistically, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the annals of Edgar Allan Poe's verse, \"Dream-Land\" stands as one of his most haunting compositions. Within its pages, he employs the term \"Thulé,\" echoing a reference from Virgil, who used it to denote an island beyond the known world, north of Britain. Yet, there exists a more contemporary source that must be acknowledged. Poe, it is known, was deeply engrossed in the works of German authors.\n\nThis connection is of great significance, for it reveals Poe's familiarity with the writings of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his meticulous examination of Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" draws a compelling parallel between the two poets' works, concluding that Poe was, indeed, drawing inspiration from Goethe's pen.\n\nGoethe, a luminary in the realm of literary endeavor, penned the tragic verse drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, the first in 1808, and the second in 1832, the year of his passing. Within this latter section lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a king who, grief-stricken by the death of his queen, succumbs to despair and ultimately meets his end. The parallels between this king and the speaker of Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, as if Poe himself had stepped into the shadow of Goethe's own words.\n\nPoe's use of Thulé is not confined to \"Dream-Land\" alone. He references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and employs the term twice more as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" These two poems can be viewed as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" acting as a vivid exploration of the themes and imagery present in Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" The landscape of Thulé, as described by the speaker, is one of darkness, loneliness, and haunting memories of lost friends, a realm devoid of color and life. This description mirrors the despair and desolation felt by the King of Thulé, who, much like the speaker, is haunted by the memory of his deceased queen and the loss of his will to live.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is undeniable, and it is likely that Poe, a man of deep literary admiration, would have been exposed to Goethe's works through the many reproductions circulating at the time. His respect for Tennyson, too, would have led him to explore the works of this celebrated German author.",
            "In the vast expanse of California's legal landscape, the question stands as to whether a patron, after succumbing to the treacherous embrace of an applesauce spill in the belly of D&D's groceries, might find solace in the cold, unyielding justice of punitive damages, given the derelict nature of the store's manager. To walk the plank of this legal inquiry, one must first navigate the treacherous waters of malice, a concept that stirs the souls of judges and lawyers alike.\n\nA judge, wise in the ways of the law, would not lightly dismiss such a claim. To prove that punitive damages are justified, a plaintiff must lay bare the defendant's actions, demonstrating a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would befall others. Jennifer Palmer, our plaintiff, will argue that the defendant, Paul Martin, should have known the peril of his inaction, given the silent sentinels of previous slips and falls that had befallen D&D's patrons. Despite this, Martin stood resolute, his dinner break a testament to his indifference.\n\nOn the thirteenth of October, at the hour of five, an employee named Rich Wayne reported an applesauce spill to Martin, his words echoing in the void of managerial apathy. Martin, consumed by his own appetites, dismissed the matter with a wave of his hand, leaving the spill to fester like an open wound. Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, did her duty and notified Martin again, but the manager's heart remained unmoved. At the stroke of half-past five, the stage was set for disaster as Jennifer Palmer, our unfortunate patron, slipped and fell, her back a casualty of the ignored peril.\n\nThe echoes of these incidents do not stand alone. Five such incidents had already stained the pages of D&D's accident reports in the year that had passed. Yet, Martin, a man of apparent malice, stood by, his conduct a testament to a willful disregard for the safety of his patrons. The law, in its infinite wisdom, has decreed that such conduct, committed with a despicable disregard for the rights and safety of others, is indeed malice.\n\nCalifornia's legal tapestry weaves a thread of malice into its fabric, defining it as conduct that intends harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. Courts have characterized such conduct as malicious when the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions, yet willfully and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences. It is in this light that we must examine the actions of Paul Martin, and the fate that awaits the punitive damage claim of Jennifer Palmer.",
            "Four years past, I encountered a course on the faith of Islam, taught at CBC. The class was a crucible of debate, the chief contention being whether Islam harbors hostility. The pertinence of this inquiry, I now believe, has never been more acute. Since the day of infamy, the mass media's perspective has oscillated wildly, from a hostile view of Islam and its extremists to a state of near-tolerance, a shift that, in 2001, seemed unimaginable. A president like Barack Obama, with a Muslim heritage, would have been inconceivable then.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography piqued my interest. The narrative of Muhammad, as presented, seems at odds with the historical record. The Muhammad I've encountered is a figure of force, compelling tribes to adopt Islam through conquest. Yet, the biography paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and meek. It is this disparity that troubles me. The stories of his 'miracles' share uncanny echoes with those of Jesus. The tale of the multiplying mutton and milk echoes the loaves and fishes. This stylistic choice, I find, serves to diminish the miracle of Jesus, as if the life of Muhammad is a pale imitation.\n\nMoreover, the stories in the biography, while claiming to offer witness, often come from third-party accounts. The narrative of hearsay, of 'so-and-so heard from so-and-so,' diminishes the credibility of the tales, casting doubt on their veracity.\n\nWhat disquiets me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad, to cast him as a godly man, humble and wise. Yet, history tells a different tale. If today's Muslims were to learn the truth of Muhammad's rise, I wonder how it would inform their faith.",
            "The teachings of the man they call Jesus, and the beliefs he held in his mortal days, were swiftly abandoned as Christianity took root upon the earth. The history of this faith, if viewed with a broad, sweeping gaze, reveals a ceaseless drift from its origins. The present world, it seems, is marked by an ever-increasing consciousness and a unprecedentedly progressive spirit. Though traditionalists persist, their influence may yet prove insufficient to sway the whole. Among those who claim the name of Christ, a deepening understanding of history will spread, a yearning to distinguish the doctrines added over time from the true intent of their founder. This reversal is as inevitable as the setting of the sun, a process that will strip away the layers of belief, one by one, like the hands of time ticking backwards, until only the essence of what Jesus brought to the world remains. When this tide of change sweeps across the United States and Europe, it will carry with it a multitude, leading them to worship as if they themselves walked in the time of Jesus, guided by his words alone. The church, in its institutional might, will stand strong, yet the theological clock will have turned back, and the profusion of diversity within Christendom will give way to a uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between sects, between every division, differences will fade away, revealing a singular truth. Human history is rife with such reversals. Once reviled and persecuted, Christianity became the state religion of Rome. The tables have turned since the dark days of African-American slavery, and the tables will turn again in the arena of the Christian faith, seeking the source and undoing the diversity in its wake. But this process will be made possible by a new way of reading Jesus' words, not as literal edicts, but as metaphorical parables. What, then, has transpired since the days of Jesus?\n\nIf we delve far enough into the annals of history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of the Christian faith. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at its core, by the time Rome had seized Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not united in spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "In the grim heart of man, there lies a dark current, an insatiable hunger for gain and power, a selfishness that knows no bounds. This is the truth Upton Sinclair laid bare in his grim tale, \"The Jungle.\" The factory owners and managers, those men with eyes like coal and hearts as cold as the river's flow, saw only their own ambition, their own empire to forge. They cared not for the smoke that choked the lungs of children nor the stench of animal waste that fouled the earth. The very air was rent with the ceaseless din of their industry, a symphony of greed and neglect.\n\nThese leviathans of progress cared not for the men who toiled in their service. \"From the top to the bottom, it was a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair wrote. The men were but cogs in a beastly machine, their lives had no value save in their ability to produce wealth. They were forced to labor in brutal conditions, their bodies and spirits broken by the relentless pace. A sudden layoff, a gleam in the eye of a manager, and multitudes were cast aside like so much refuse. There were no laws to shield these poor souls, no organizations to champion their cause. The unions, they were little more than wolves in sheep's clothing, fleecing the flock they were meant to protect.\n\nThese men, these slaves of the machine, were trapped in a system as unforgiving as the wilderness, as harsh as the winter's frost. They were expected to endure the hell of Packingtown, to accept their fate as a matter of course. There was no escape, no respite, only the endless cycle of toil and despair. Sinclair's words echo with the pitiful cry of a people crushed under the heel of progress: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation, dependent for their opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "In the vast expanse of narrative waters, authors chart diverse courses to evoke sentiments and attitudes toward pivotal subjects. Fitzgerald, with his pen, navigates these waters deftly in \"The Great Gatsby.\" His techniques, both subtle and profound, weave a tapestry that enthralls the reader.\n\nHe pairs nouns and adjectives in ways that dance on the edge of convention, conferring upon the reader a sense of the ethereal. Symbols, too, are his tools, imbued with meaning and wielded to evoke emotions. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald bathes his narrative in hues, each one a whisper of significance: gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.\n\nWhite and gray, his steadfast companions, carry the weight of uniformity. White, a beacon of elegance and refinement, and gray, a whisper of decay and age. Fitzgerald introduces these hues in the novel's opening, a symphony of white: Daisy and Jordan, constant in their pristine attire, and Nick, donning \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party. Even the uninvited Tom wears a \"white shirt\" in his tryst with Myrtle. The city itself is a canvas, with Nick descending into \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" of partygoers etched on his mind. Even the mundane is infused with these hues: Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood,\" the \"gray land\" of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child, and the \"gray old man\" of the dog-seller.\n\nAfter having woven a tale of significance around these hues, Fitzgerald applies them to Daisy, the elusive object of Gatsby's longing. When she emerges in her \"little white roadster,\" she becomes a fixture, a uniform addition to the tapestry of the story. The \"gray haze\" of her fur collar, and her \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter, serve to diminish her character, reducing her to a symbol of Gatsby's desire.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is a masterful dance, a ballet of emotions and significations. He turns the mundane into the profound, the ordinary into the extraordinary, all through the delicate art of imbuing color with meaning.",
            "In the sun-scorched lands of San Diego County, the earth yields bountifully, fed by a benevolent climate that caresses the land in warm embrace. Tomatoes, lemons, and other fruits of the earth swell and ripen under the golden sun, while the earth is nurtured by the hands of those who till her soil. The soil, rich and unspoiled, bears witness to the toil of farmers who tend to it with care, for it is the lifeblood of their existence. This is a land where the line between nature and the human spirit blurs, where the organic certification is a badge of honor, a testament to the respect for the land and its inhabitants.\n\nThe market for such pure, unadulterated produce is robust, with a hunger for the untouched taste of nature's bounty. The demand for organic eggs and milk is insatiable, their consumers craving the simplicity of true sustenance. The landowner, a visionary, sees the potential in this untapped market, a niche where the scales of nature and commerce intersect. Yet, the path to this promised land is fraught with challenges, for the organic farm demands more from its keeper than the conventional fields. It requires a constant vigilance, a ceaseless battle against pest and weed, a delicate dance with the soil to nurture its life and yield its fruits.\n\nThe land in question lies in the shadow of the grand Cleveland National Forest, a parcel of 160 acres that bears the marks of the past. It is a landscape that has known the touch of the Native American hand and the boot of the cattle rancher, a testament to the enduring spirit of the land. It stands in the heart of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, a sanctuary home to a hundred species, many of them endangered, their existence teetering on the precipice of oblivion.\n\nThe ecoregion's conservation plan is still being debated, but the fate of these creatures hangs in the balance. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher all call this land home, their survival intertwined with the health of the land. The landowner, a beacon of hope, seeks to be both a conserver and a creator, a guardian of the past and a visionary of the future. He seeks guidance, a path to balance the scales of profit and preservation, a way to turn the tide for the creatures that call this land home.",
            "Culture, an elusive beast, is both what it is and what it is not. It is not a static thing, nor is it singular. It is a tapestry woven with threads of history, prejudice, and personal experience. To presume that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating is to oversimplify the complex dance of culture. A negotiator would do well to understand the spirit of a culture, its rhythm, and how it will shape the parley.\n\nWhen one steps into the arena of a foreign culture, one does not see only what is present, but also what is absent. One must accept, without judgment, the culture's quirks and idiosyncrasies, for these are the bones of its meaning. Respect for tradition and belief, even in the heart of a stranger's land, can ease the negotiation's passage.\n\nCulture does not confine itself to national borders. Within each nation, companies carve out their own worlds, with unique languages, customs, and beliefs. It is in the dress codes, the manner of speech, the way duties are delegated, and the charities they endorse that one can glimpse a company's culture. Even within the vast expanse of the American corporate landscape, there is diversity, from the relentless to the laissez-faire, from the urban to the suburban.\n\nValues, the heart of a culture, provide its purpose. If face or harmony are valued, a negotiator will not dishonor them. Likewise, if a hard bargain is prized, the urge to settle will be tempered. Before the negotiation, it is wise to understand these values. Yet, to know one's opponent on a personal level can bring a subtle, yet powerful, edge to the parley.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" Thus begins Psalm 14, and so does St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. This sentiment is echoed by another thinker we shall discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Both, so it seems, believe in the same deity, the God of the Bible. To fairly weigh their arguments, we must start with the presumption that both are correct in their belief.\n\nTo sway from this path would be to lose the essence of their arguments, for they each defend a singular God. However, both arguments, despite their merits, fail to provide a comprehensive basis for belief.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument, in its bare bones, posits that God's existence can be found within our own understanding. He suggests that we need not venture beyond our souls to find evidence of Him, but rather to look within. This idea, though convoluted in its articulation, implies that God's existence is self-evident within our own minds. This notion is akin to the Christian concept of faith, wherein acceptance is required in the absence of irrefutable evidence.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach, one might argue, is advantageous for evangelism, as it allows for the recruitment of converts based on logic alone. He presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially posits that the necessity of God can be logically deduced from the world around us.",
            "In the shadows of a distant era, circa the fifth or sixth century before the Common Era, a prince was born, who would one day be known as the Buddha. Over the expanse of his life, he turned his back on the world, attaining enlightenment, and his teachings birthed Buddhism, the most steadfast branch of which is Theravada Buddhism. This religion, now some twenty-five hundred years old, bears little resemblance to its origins, as evidenced by the annual water-cutting ceremony in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka. Monks and laymen alike partake in this ritual, though the Buddha himself never spoke of such festivities. These deviations stretch from superficial traditions to the very heart of the religion's soteriological core. The Theravada Buddhist community, from the cloister to the hearth, has had to alter its doctrinal tenets over the centuries, driven by forces both internal and external, hostile and benign.\n\nTo navigate this discussion, we must understand several qualifying terms. Internal forces are those born within the fold of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their status. External forces originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or damage the Buddhist community, driven by a malicious perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, while not necessarily seeking to help or hinder, may inadvertently do so.\n\nFirst, let us delve into the essentials of the religion—the doctrines that form the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the essence of doctrine, is composed of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka comprises the metaphysical components. These include Anatta, the absence of a fixed soul; Dukkha, the inherent suffering of life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Recognizing these concepts allows one to break free of Sansara, the cycle of birth and rebirth, and thereby end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, and achieve enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, five for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not indulge in intoxicating substances), and many more for monks. The most fundamental doctrinal notion is the four noble truths: First, the truth of suffering, Dukkha; second, the truth that attachment causes suffering; third, the truth that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico, once bound in a protracted rivalry that spanned fifty-seven years, from 1836 to 1893, bear witness to a feud that has echoed through history. The zenith of this enmity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States, with a swift and decisive blow, vanquished Mexico and laid claim to Texas and the American Southwest, new fields for the hungry nation. The tension did not dissipate with this single conflict; it simmered, a boil beneath the surface, until the Great War put an end to it (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The root of this animosity was as much about material interests as it was about differing beliefs, a clash of cultures and traditions, a rift between the Protestant and the Catholic (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis is not an anomaly, but a common tale told among nations that share a border, their interests intertwined in a dance of power and aspiration. The United States and Mexico are but two among many pairs of neighboring nations, bound by proximity and adversity. David M. Pletcher (1977) posits, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, these two nations, geographically close to the United States, have been entangled in a web of rivalry, while others in Latin America have enjoyed a more amicable relationship.\n\nReligious differences, a familiar foe to many a nation, have strained the bond between the United States and Mexico. Sally Frahm (2001) asserts, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). The ideological struggle between the United States and Mexico was not merely a contest of political ideologies, but a clash of religious persuasions. This enmity was a relic of the historic distrust between the English and Spanish, a legacy that impeded the establishment of cordial diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States during this fifty-seven-year period. Most of these disputes were territorial in nature, born of raids from Mexican territory into American soil and other frontier problems (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). The border was a frontier, a wild and unpredictable place, where outlaws and bandits operated with impunity, their raids a constant threat until both nations exerted military force to tame the wildlands.\n\nSchmitt (1974) attests that the rivalry began to abate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, a shift that culminated in American ambitions moving from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico, marking the end of an era in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen‭ ‬years passed since the illness, uninvited and unforeseen,‭ ‬seized me with an iron grip,‭ ‬rendering me unable to tend to the bodies I‭'d‭ ‬once cared for as a nurse. I was a‭ ‬child of uncertainty,‭ ‬and the voice of certainty in my life was the whispered promise‭: \"You'll always find work, people will always need tending.\" So,‭ ‬despite my heart yearning for the lab or the newsroom,‭ ‬I found solace in the steady rhythm of the sickroom.

My Social Security Disability has seen to it that I am not starving,‭ ‬but the pride and security of self-sufficiency have long since fled. I am a man adrift,‭ ‬but not alone in my tumultuous sea. My family and a few steadfast friends have been my anchor,‭ ‬their kindness my only certainty in this storm.\n\nThe truth remains,‭ ‬life is a tapestry of emergencies,‭ ‬both large and small,‭ ‬and no amount of preparation can shield from the unexpected. I agree,‭ ‬the government is a decrepit,‭ ‬rotting beast,‭ ‬but I see no need to abandon it entirely.‭ ‬Instead,‭ ‬I long for a nation of mutual respect,‭ ‬one that trusts in the strength of community.

            "In the shadowed recesses of existence, where the unseen tendrils of evolution stretch, the question gnaws at the mind: Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there boundaries or shackles that guide the dance of change? D'Arcy Thompson, in his 1917 musings, whispered that even the simplest organic forms eluded the grasp of mathematical language. Yet, in this age, the call of numbers has echoed, beckoning us towards clarity. Our quest delves into the mathematical modeling of Prunum, a mollusk, through the prism of ontogeny and phylogeny. X-rays have laid bare the quantifiable parameters of these shells, which we have fed into CerioShell, a software that mimics the dance of growth. We have sketched hypothetical morphologies, the boundaries of possibility in this stained-glass world of shell. The echoes of our mathematical whispers are harmonizing with the rhythm of experimental and descriptive studies, seeking to understand the macroevolutionary symphony of Prunum.\n\nA shell, a tube that traverses the circular dance of time, its turns or whorls spiraling around an axis, the columella, unyielding and central. The speed of enlargement varies, a continuous line separating each whorl, a suture. The largest whorl, the body whorl, stands sentinel at the end, the spire stretching back to the apex, its opposite end the base, the aperture, the gateway to the world beyond. The aperture, a window into the shell's journey through time and space, its path traced by coordinates, a mathematical ballet of growth.\n\nThis trajectory, once graphed and quantified, allows for parameters to be varied, the skeletogenesis of the mollusk to be remade in the crucible of numbers.",
            "In the realm where the sun scorches the earth and the shadows dance with drought, the specter of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained a sullen and unyielding presence for a decade. The nation, a behemoth of ambition, strides toward the goals set forth by the Millennium Development, yet the pace of progress in the realm of child and maternal health remains a desolate and desolate march. The reasons for this languor are manifold, and they whisper of a need to bolster the very heart of the health system, rather than to bandage the wounds of its surface.\n\nThe birth of a child in Indonesia now sees the hand of a skilled laborer seventy-two percent of the time, a feat that should be lauded. Yet, this tally includes hands that wield no more than the ancient arts of the midwife, a blade that cannot staunch the river of blood that claims so many mothers. The mothers' grievous plight is not confined to their bodies, for the care of their infants is also wanting. The number of children under five who have sought professional care for diarrhea has declined, their cries echoing through empty clinics. The data on postnatal care is as elusive as the rain in a desert, and it whispers of woe.\n\nThe blade of the scalpel, that instrument of rebirth, is wielded but a mere four percent of the time. The chasm of inequity yawns wide, with cities enjoying a c-section rate of seven percent, while the rural jungle sees a rate of but two. The cities of glass and steel, they gleam with the light of health, while the children of the countryside are left in the shadows. The poor, too, are left to wither, their cries for aid unheeded, their purses bare of coin.\n\nIn the labyrinth of solutions, the question that echoes is this: how best to slay the beast of scarcity? Should the nation focus its gaze on the wounds of the body, or should it seek to strengthen the very heart that pumps life's blood? The siren call of programmatic approaches is strong, their promises of swift and certain results a sweet melody. Yet, they are a double-edged blade, for they too often draw resources away from the slender thread of the overall health system. The ghost of HIV/AIDS, a specter of the past, whispers of the family planning sector's withered husk. The dance of duplication and disarray, a shadow play of forms and paperwork, is a price too high to pay.",
            "Victorian novels are typically marked by their meticulous attention to detail and their preoccupation with the aristocracy of the time. Yet, two notable outliers from this tradition are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" These works diverge with their unusual blend of mystery and the bizarre, qualities uncommon in the period. This blend serves to deepen the characters within each novel, granting insight into their motivations and emotions. In \"Oliver Twist,\" the protagonist experiences a shooting that is revisited in his mind, not as a memory, but as a vivid dream. This repeated vision underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfold, as well as his dire health situation. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit during the shooting reveal his desperation and the constant, tormenting pain that he endures. This scene emphasizes his inability to gain control or even attempt to influence the outcome of his fate, highlighting the growing sense of defeat that seems to be seeping into his psyche, perhaps instilled by Fagin himself. The shooting, therefore, reinforces the notion that Oliver's life is increasingly beyond his control. This sense of fate is further emphasized in the novel's portrayal of time, where \"the day passed off\" not as a usual passage of time, but as a fleeting, dreadful eternity.\n\n“In the midst of his thoughts, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas assailed him. He found himself still walking between Sikes and Crackit, their angry dispute echoing in his mind as if they were arguing right before him. When he turned his attention to himself, he realized he was conversing with them… Suddenly, he started at the report of a firearm; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through these rapid visions, an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain tormented him incessantly.”\n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThe mystery in these novels often emerges through dreamlike sequences, with different content and purposes in each case. In \"Oliver Twist,\" such sequences reveal insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his sources of pain, and his understanding of the world around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in Chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that transpire, as well as the dire straits his health has fallen into, reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbs all his senses, as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he endures his despair once more, removed from the initial shock of pain, as the pain now persists, linked with fear instead of surprise. With Oliver overwhelmed, questions arise about whose will brought about his misfortune, for it certainly was not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is in jeopardy. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.”",
            "Some time ago, I found myself in the role of a tutor at an after-school program, tasked with assisting elementary-aged students in their academic endeavors. Though I was not unskilled in the art of instruction, my abilities were most keenly felt in the realm of English and reading. I was summoned by one of the instructors to aid a young boy named Adrian, who seemed to flounder in the sea of letters. His difficulties were singularly peculiar; some letters he pronounced with ease, while others eluded him entirely. In his case, the boy possessed a silver tongue in English, yet his grasp of the alphabet was as tenuous as the grasp of a child on a rope. It was during this time that I was privileged to meet Adrian's mother, a woman who spoke naught but Spanish. My own command of the language was as yet unrefined, but we managed to carve a path through the linguistic labyrinth before us. It was then that it struck me like a bullet from a gun; Adrian was not illiterate, but his alphabet was as foreign to him as the moon to the earth.\n\nI recount this tale to shed light on the murky waters of language barriers in our schools, particularly in the vast expanse of California. It is a problem that is not always as apparent as we might suspect. A child who speaks English with the fluency of a native-born speaker may still find the act of reading to be as opaque as a foggy night. This is a reality that we must acknowledge and address, for it is a problem that exists. In Adrian's case, the solution was a straightforward one; tutoring in English reading, with a particular focus on the alphabet and its pronunciation. But for the many children who speak English as a second language, the solution is as complex as a labyrinth.\n\nThe dual language system, to my mind, is a commendable endeavor. It is not merely for those whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Children who partake in such programs have been found to excel academically. Yet, there is a specter of fear that hovers over this idea, that it is a waste of resources, that the majority will gain no benefit. This is a fallacy. If we were to implement such programs in our classrooms, all children would stand to benefit. But how do we achieve this? Should we mandate that all teachers possess a mastery of two languages? Certainly not. This would be a burden too great to bear. Yet, I believe there is no reason why we cannot have bilingual aides, tutors, or whatever term one might choose to employ.",
            "From the moment we stand before the vastness of this world, it is whispered to us that there is something greater than ourselves, beyond our grasp. Some are sent to church, others to temple, and a few delve deep within themselves in search of truth. Many accept the faith of their fathers, while others cast it aside as a vain pursuit. Each of us, in our own way, seek to define a part of ourselves through a unique perspective on the divine. We yearn for a light in the dark, a path out of shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him of his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain drumming on the tin roof above, and we smoked our cigarettes in silence. The gutters wept, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. His gaze was one of searching and remembering, his body thinner, clothes loose, hair sparse. I felt alone, afraid, and incapable of speaking of my loss. I hugged him, drew my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall on the June twilight.\n\nMy father slipped away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatment had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost, I could not fathom. I found myself questioning the nature of a God who would allow such cruelty. Yet, in the dark, I offered no prayer. If such a being existed, I thought, He had long ceased listening to me.\n\nI did not wish to witness his passing from this world into another. I could not bear to see the life that had birthed me fade away. I chose to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I curled into a ball in my bed and waited, for three days, for the silence to speak. But it did not.\n\nNo call came.",
            "The Gothic novel, in both essence and nomenclature, is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt posits in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. It has been both reviled and revered, accused of shallowness, and lauded for its \"terrible sublime\" allure (Burke). The original Gothic novel, Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, synthesized the ancient and modern romance to forge a new literary path. Walpole employed theatrical elements of yore and modern mimicry of nature to present his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre retains echoes of medieval theater, architecture, and traditions, even as the term \"gothic\" was used to describe diverse races, styles, and epochs. It was seen as archaic, unsophisticated in the face of modern societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's personal narrative allowed it to endure, to become both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nA pivotal aspect of Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry—the training of a proper knight—lives on, transmuted in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry resonated with Gothic writers, representing the brave, honorable, competent knight and the perceived lack thereof in contemporary society. Through chivalric imagery, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the Gothic's evolution into the Romantic. Walpole, amidst political turmoil and unjust accusations, may have grown disillusioned with the moral decay of his time. He may have yearned for the supposed goodness and morality of the Gothic age, a sentiment reflected in his characters. Consider Frederic, described as:",
            "Supply chain management, a term coined by the consultant Keith Oliver in '82, is the ceaseless flow of processes that carry goods from the customer's order through the raw materials, supply, production, and ultimately, distribution to the customer's hands. It entails the planning, implementation, and oversight of the chain's activities to meet the customer's demands swiftly and efficiently. Six are the sentinels that stand guard over this intricate dance: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the pillars on which business managers erect their strategies to serve the customer best.\n\nThe first step in this ballet is production. It is the very bedrock upon which the entire edifice rests. It is here that managers must divine the customers' desires, and the market is the oracle from which they seek enlightenment. Once the market's whispers are understood, decisions are made: what to produce, and in what quantities. The location of the production is then determined, weighing volume and quality against the customer's need and satisfaction. The dance of production is a rigorous one, with every step requiring meticulous planning. A single misstep can cost the company dearly in time and coin. I, who have toiled in the halls of Wal-Mart and Target, have seen firsthand the importance of designed processes. Uniforms, shipments, every detail is laid out in a meticulous booklet to ensure smooth operation without the confusion of direction or expectation.\n\nThe second sentinel is supply, a strategic decision that molds the core capabilities of a facility and forges outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager's task is to choose the division that best suits the product's processes. Outsourcing, a choice often made for velocity, offers the promise of quality and flexibility while reducing costs or maintaining them at a low level.",
            "In the shattered remnants of a once-great plain, a sign stands, its dull surface bearing a grim message: Hitler lives. A lone figure, a child of the screen, holds the shabby placard aloft, her eyes reflecting the despair of the forgotten. The shadows of Burmese jungles whisper of a land torn asunder by a grasping fist, a junta's grip that clutches at the throat of a nation. The color of their robes, saffron, is the hue of their revolution, a defiant cry in the face of tyranny. Monks, the guardians of the spirit, took to the streets, their voices echoing the silent prayers of a people long denied their voice. The world watched, unblinking, as the fist of the junta tightened, monasteries burned, and journalists, like the poor Kenji Nagai, fell beneath the heel.\n\nThis is not a tale of distant shores, nor a relic of ages past. It is the dark reflection of a world where authority and power cling like plague, their tentacles reaching into the hearts of men. From the halls of Rome to the streets of Beijing, the cry of the oppressed is a haunting symphony of suffering. The echoes of Tiananmen's square, where the courage of a generation was silenced by the roar of tanks, ring through the generations. In Rwanda, shadows danced with blood as the scourge of genocide stalked the land. And in the camps of the Third Reich, the chill of death blew through the barbed wire, a bitter wind of despair.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in the realm of jazz is not merely due to his longevity, but also his uncanny ability to mold his ensemble into a living, breathing beast, each member a distinct instrument in a symphony of sound. His pianistic touch, though subtle, is the guiding hand that orchestrates the symphony, crafting textures that highlight the unique voices of his band. Ellington's compositions, a tapestry of intricate notes and harmonies, provide a framework for improvisation, where soloists can weave their melodies as freely as a river carves its path.\n\nHis masterful understanding of each player's sound, and how they coalesce into a cohesive whole, has resulted in some of the most revolutionary pieces in jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary pays homage to this genius, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as a testament to his use of the human voice as an instrument, a technique that would become a signature of his style.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" Ellington's use of voice and reeds in a call-and-response dance is a masterclass in orchestration. Six choruses, each a delicate dance of tone and texture, showcase his innovation. The first chorus begins with a smooth, melodic voice, transitioning to a rougher sound, a stark contrast that echoes the piece's blues roots. Muted trumpet and clarinet solos, in the second and third choruses, elaborate on the melody, painting with the colors of blue notes and high register sweeps. The fourth chorus sees the band echoing the first, while the fifth, a climactic chorus, sees the reeds take the lead in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with the voice adopting a \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. The piece concludes with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending, a symphonic finale that underscores Ellington's mastery of tone color.\n\nEllington's skill in tight orchestration and ear for tone is on full display in \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" recorded a year later. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he combines the muted trumpet of \"Bubber\" Miley and Baby Cox's scat singing, merging vocal elements of the trumpet with instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. In the latter, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduction of the melody is a tour de force, a testament to Ellington's ability to draw out the unique sound of each instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice and tone to add depth and color is a stylistic trait that permeates his work, a constant reminder of his genius.",

Three years hence, at seventeen, it remained, more insistent than ever. She'd thought it was something she could grasp, a thing she could claim as her own. Boys, girls, it mattered not. None had roused her interest, though they'd tried, clumsy and awkward as they were. She'd questioned this strangeness, turned it over in her mind like a stone, but found no answers that satisfied. So she lived, a stranger to her own desires.\n\nHome, usually a sanctuary, was quiet today. Her parents, they moved through life like old cattle, placid and unruffled. They argued seldom, and when they did, it was with her, their spirited daughter. Independence, they called it. She'd given them no peace, and they'd given her none. Yet, they'd made a good life, this calm couple and their storm of a daughter.\n\nThen came that scream, a sudden cry that sliced through the silence. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart pounding against her ribcage. Her mother lay on the floor, gasping, the word \"ow\" repeating like a mantra. She knelt, her hands hovering, unsure. \"Mom...?\" she whispered. Her mother's eyes fluttered open, unfocused. \"Ow... sweet... take... me... to... the... hospital.\" The words were torn from her, like strips of fabric. Her daughter nodded, her hands finding purchase. She lifted her mother, the weight surprising, and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital, a place of antiseptic and shadows, was a foreign world. She navigated its corridors, her mother a silent burden, until they reached the emergency room. A bed was rolled up, and her mother was transferred, her daughter left to stand alone, her heart a drum in her chest.\n\nHer mother had fallen, that was all. A simple accident, a broken thing. But in that moment, under the harsh glare of the hospital lights, it felt like a world had ended.",
            "In the annals of the scholarly endeavor, a study was undertaken to illuminate the correlation between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" and the mitigated risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, as well as the mortality thereof. The diet, hereafter referred to as the Mediterranean variant (Med variant), is a variant of the traditional Mediterranean Diet, characterized by an elevated consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while eschewing potatoes; it also prescribes a preference for monounsaturated fats over saturated fats, a prominent inclusion of fish, and a judicious consumption of animal products and saturated fats, with a moderate allowance for alcohol.\n\nPrevious investigations had established an inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, as well as the superiority of the Mediterranean Diet over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the overweight and obese. However, these studies, with their singular focus, had not delved into the realm of stroke and stroke-related mortality.\n\nThe present study, a retrospective longitudinal examination, followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes, participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a longitudinal cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across eleven states within the United States. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed the Med variant score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than ninety-five percent of the nurses persisted in their participation over the two-decade period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of coronary heart disease, fatal coronary heart disease, and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In instances where such records were not available, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately seventeen percent of all strokes and twenty-four percent of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified.\n\nTo mitigate random variation for each individual and more accurately represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the Med variant score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could obfuscate results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the association between the Med variant score and the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke was assessed, employing separate models for fatal and nonfatal instances of coronary heart disease and stroke.\n\nIt was found that an augmented adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as reflected by a higher Med variant diet score, was correlated with a diminished risk of incident coronary heart disease and stroke in women. Over the course of twenty years, 2391 incident cases of coronary heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined fatal coronary heart disease and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest quintile of the Med variant diet score exhibited a lower risk for both coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the year 2007, a fateful storm swept through the land of the United States, a financial tempest that left the country reeling, its economy laid low. Jobs withered on the vine, the once-proud architecture of the housing market crumbled to dust, and great corporations, pillars of the nation, were brought to their knees, their empires reduced to naught but shattered remnants. The wound remains fresh, the question persists: how did this calamity befall us, and how do we turn back the tide? The roots of this financial crisis lie in the hearts of men, in decisions made with eyes turned inward, not outward. Banks and firms, driven by greed and naivety, extended credit to those unworthy, burdening them with sub-prime loans. The infrastructure of our financial system, immature and insufficient, buckled under the weight.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown in the year of our Lord nineteen ninety-nine, during the reign of the Clinton presidency. The man in the White House, his sights set on another term, chose to loosen the shackles that bound the banks. The banks, freed, ran amok, their greed unchecked. The New York Times, in its wisdom, foretold the doom that would follow. \"Fannie Mae,\" it wrote, \"has been under increasing pressure from the White House and its shareholders to expand mortgage loans to the least fortunate among us.\" The words of the prophet were true. The storm was coming, a storm of ill-advised lending that would lead to the downfall of the nation.\n\nThe financial markets were a labyrinth, a twisting, turning path of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. The more these instruments intertwined, the more the economy became enmeshed in the housing market. And so, the nation's households and financial markets alike overleaned, exposed to the slightest of breezes. And when the bubble burst, the financial institutions that had bought into this folly were left with naught but the bitter taste of defeat.\n\nIn the end, the top five investment banks stood before the nation, their debts at $4.1 trillion, a figure that accounted for nearly a third of the country's GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers crumbled like a house of cards, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to don the mantle of commercial banks, their wings clipped by the heavy hand of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, the great titans of mortgage debt, stood at $5 trillion, their heads bowed under the weight of government control, brought low by the storm they had helped to unleash.",
            "Ah, the dreaded exposition. That infernal stretch of prose where the author attempts to unfurl his or her wings, only to find them clipped by the relentless tide of information. It's the difference between a soaring eagle and a crashing insect, a symphony and a cacophony. Dr. Merlin, in her wisdom, has uttered oaths at her keyboard when she finds herself ensnared in the morass of Too Much Information, a predicament not so delightful as one might imagine.\n\nExposition, my dear reader, is not your ally. We have all heard the dictum, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin herself has been ensnared in its clutches, entangled in webs of words that lead nowhere or, worse, nowhere fast. Exposition, that insidious whisperer, beckons for us to get the story out of the way, to hurry through the mundane details that, in the grand theater of life, are never so simple.\n\nTake, for instance, the tale of a heroine and her beloved. You might be told they met at a certain place and time, wed in a grand ceremony, and that her husband met his demise before her eyes. You would not expect this tale to be told in a breath, nor would you wish to read two pages of unexceptional prose, during which both parties speak nary a single word. You would expect, nay, demand, that the author paint their portraits in broad and vivid strokes, that you witness the husband's love for his wife through his words and deeds, and that the heroine reveal her thoughts and dreams through the prism of his life.\n\nFor it is not enough to simply know they met, they married, he died. You must feel it, as if you yourself stood there, witnessed their love bloom, wither, and die. You must mourn his loss with her, and in doing so, become entwined in her fate.\n\nYet, it is tempting to rush. To introduce a new character and simply state his past, his present, his dreams. To give him a simple biography rather than a life. Dr. Merlin herself has been tempted, and thus, she implores you, dear writer, to resist the siren call of the simple sentence. To provide the meat, not just the bone.",
            "I sat through two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, as they flickered across my screen. The first, from NBC 4, was live and aired on the thirteenth day of August, 2011. The lead story was of a man, Shad Hostettler, who had slit the throat of his wife in Ashley. The newscaster, his voice a monotone, rattled off the name and the gruesome act, presenting a mugshot that seemed to beckon pure malice. They lingered on him for two minutes, a grim silence hanging heavy in the air, before moving on.\n\nThe second tale was of a youth, Travis Buyers, who had been caught in the crossfire of Sharon Woods. Shot and critically wounded, he lay there, a pawn in a dance of violence. The SWAT team was called, but no arrests made, no suspects named. The story was brief, no more than a whisper, but I've seen this before - a black life snuffed out, a shadow brushed aside.\n\nThe rain and thunderstorms predicted for the weekend were next, a weather forecast that was as dark as the other stories. The temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties, a tepid promise of warmth.\n\nThe final story was of a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, wearing a hoodie, was the culprit. They lingered on his race, his skin's hue, his height and weight. It was an odd disproportion, a focus that seemed to serve no purpose.\n\nThen came the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin convicted of distributing marijuana across the border. Instead of years, the sentence was spoken in months, a harsh, cold number - three hundred. His ethnicity was mentioned, a detail that seemed to cling to the story like a shadow.",
            "There lies an indomitable, unyielding bond between brothers, a bond that runs deeper than the roots of the ancient oak. Within this bond, a labyrinth of emotions unfurls - love, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Brothers comprehend each other in ways that others never can, and in the eyes of their kin, they see not a reflection of their own image, but the truth of their soul laid bare. When the storm of life rages, it is here that the true nature of this bond is revealed, shining through like a beacon in the darkest night. The cost of these emotions, born of blood and bone, must be paid, and paid dearly. To understand the heart of this fraternal tie is to grapple with the consequences it bears. In the brother's gaze, one sees not the world as others see it, but as it truly is, stripped of all pretense. It is in their deeds and the fallout that follows that their true character is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers traverse this theme, and the tumultuous emotions that attend it. Through landscapes teeming with life and vivid imagery, these two boys embark on a journey that is as futile as it is profound. Bitterness and exultation clash in their final, fateful encounter, and only one brother emerges from the ashes. The theme is woven through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which imparts the complex feelings of the protagonist and his view of the world, both of which shape his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be distilled to a single emotion: pride. From their first foray together, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his brother, Doodle. He yearned for a sibling to impart his worldly knowledge upon, to race with to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine's embrace. Yet, Doodle's frail heart and condition made these dreams a mockery. The protagonist, his head filled with wild notions, found these aspirations shattered in an instant. He even considered extinguishing the life that had so dashed his hopes, contemplating to smother Doodle with a pillow. But the small child's smile, that simple act, gave him hope. This shows that his resolve was not unyielding. In the depths of his heart, he harbored an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the silent, ceaseless hum of thought, the human brain, a labyrinth of circuitry and pulsating flesh, labors. As the world has advanced, so too have the metaphors we employ to grasp its workings. From the wax tablet, to the papyrus scroll, to the bound book, we've sought to comprehend this enigmatic organ. Yet, these metaphors bear the weight of their own limitations, like the ghosts of former knowledge haunting the present.\n\nThe brain's journey begins with the harbingers of sense - the eyes, ears, skin, and tongue - transforming the world's raw signals into electrochemical whispers. These whispers are shaped anew by the brain's algorithms, a relentless dance of bottom-up and top-down processing. In the tapestry of perception, the simplest threads of color, shape, and light are woven into a whole, the black box on the white background. The top-down process, like a wind through the trees, quickens the recognition, guiding the eye to see not just a shape, but a black box, and not a hole in the white.\n\nAttention, the gatekeeper, decides what whispers to let through. In the cacophony of life, it filters out the unimportant, the inconsequential, the mere rustling of grass. Yet, like a hound on the scent, it can single out the crucial, the familiar, the name spoken in the din of a room.\n\nTo process, the brain must first store. There are the fleeting, ephemeral memories of sensory experience, the short memory holding space for a fleeting moment, and the vast, enduring store of long-term memory, where information is etched into the structures of proteins, like words carved into stone.\n\nThe brain's knowledge, it's said, is organized in a grand web of associations, nodes of thought linked by the threads of relatedness. In this intricate design, a chair, as if by some unseen hand, is linked to a table, to the grain of wood, to the very essence of these things.",
            "In the grim tale of Aldous Huxley, \"Brave New World,\" the specter of both technological advancement and the capitalist system it engenders looms large, casting a dystopian shadow over the future. The inhabitants of this world value the collective over the individual, their minds conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification as the ultimate pursuit. They are but pawns in a grand game, their fates dictated by the World Controller, who weaves their ideologies as a spider does its web.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist critique, Huxley's reservations about the burgeoning economic order become starkly apparent. Terms such as homogenization and reification echo through the narrative, highlighting the author's disdain for the emerging economic structure of his time. Capitalism is ridiculed through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common folk are blinded to their true relationship to the economic classes, their minds fixated on self-interest and the fleeting pleasures of consumption.\n\nThe common classes, Delta, Gamma and their like, are as much slaves to their conditioning as they are to their station in life. Hypnopædia, the state's system of sleep learning, reinforces this. The World Controller, the puppeteer pulling the strings, manipulates their desires, their wants, their very identities. Hegemony is the tool he wields, subjugating the lower classes to the whims of the upper, who, despite their awareness, do little to resist.\n\nIn this world, individuality is a foreign concept. Characters, even the most prominent, are little more than ciphers, their depths unplumbed. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the union of technology and capitalism strips man of his free will, his self-expression. Love and its extremes are absent, interactions kept shallow and superficial. Men comment on women's physical attributes, and women discuss their encounters with the same dispassion. The complacency of each class in their societal roles is a stark indication of the socioeconomic oppression of capitalism. They obey their place, their role, their lot, in the grand machine, a testament to the Marxist notion of the proletariat, content in their lot so long as they consume, obey, and stay in line.",
            "I've been a student here at University Park for nigh on two and a half years, or the better part of four and a half semesters. Navigation on this campus can be a trialsome endeavor, a fact that has been etched into my bones since my freshman year. I found myself in an East Halls dormitory, the easternmost outpost of our fair campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The journey from my humble abode in Stuart Hall to classes in distant places like the Willard building could take upwards of a quarter of an hour on foot, and that's not even accounting for the weather, which is as unpredictable as a drunkard's path.\n\nAn aging alum, with more miles on his boots than a traveling salesman, told me of a time when the East Halls were isolated by vast, empty tracts of land. Now, that emptiness has given birth to sports fields, a new Creamery, health services, and apartment blocks, encircling the dorms like a fortress. As our campus swells, so does the challenge of traversing its length and breadth.\n\nThe bicycle, that two-wheeled contraption, is the answer, yet it's not the whole solution. It requires a resolve to ride, and a campus that caters to its needs. I spoke to a friend who recently returned to his bicycle after a hiatus. \"Bikes are the only way,\" he mused, \"for a spell it wasn't fashionable, but it's the way to go.\" The bicycle, alongside a bowl of oatmeal, can carry you far, as I've learned in my journey from off-campus lodgings to Thomas building.\n\nEvery morning, the journey from my home to Thomas can be a twenty-five-minute trudge on foot, but with a bike, it's reduced to a mere five minutes, if one pedals with enough spirit. Yet, Pollock Road, the most direct route, is not always an easy path, be it on two feet or two wheels. Walking, too, has its merits, but I'm in a hurry, and time is a precious commodity.\n\nIf I didn't have my bicycle, the walk would be my only recourse, a journey that would claim an additional 30-40 minutes each way, a loss of over two and a half hours per week. Add to that the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so forth. It's a burden I cannot bear."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I intend to tread a path that leads me to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I shall endeavor to lend aid to those children who have been afflicted by the scourge of abuse and neglect, and to offer support to those families beset by discord. The values that I bring to this endeavor are not mere abstractions but the very essence of my being: service, respect, and a steadfast commitment to the ethical pursuit of improvement in human relationships and my own professional competency. These are not merely the values of a social worker but the cornerstone of my own existence.\n\nI have always been a man possessed of a desire to alleviate the suffering of others, yet the path to this end was obscured by the fog of uncertainty. Throughout my sojourn through high school and college, I have beheld many a soul retreating from their plight in the mire of denial, and a few who have succumbed to false securities. It was this tableau of despair that prompted me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, yet the path to a career remained elusive. Thus, I took a respite upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One sultry summer's day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old lad, his demeanor as anxious as his circumstances. He sought refuge from an abusive home, and I could not turn away from his plight. The next day, I found myself at his parent's doorstep, a stranger bearing a degree in Psychology. The police were powerless, and so I engaged the parents in a conversation that revealed their hearts to be as beaten and bruised as their son's. This encounter seeded the seed of a career in social work, a means to tend to the wounds of family strife.\n\nSocial justice is a value that resonates deeply within me, for our society holds the individual in high esteem, yet we are bound by the chains of conformity. If we mourn the loss of an individual, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual, and I will not be shackled by the expectations of others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I have protested against the injustices that bind us, coloring my hair with the bold hues of defiance, donning attire that reflects my true self, piercing my ears with the rebellion of my spirit, and declaring my alliance with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance. I have fought against racism and discrimination, for I believe in the sanctity of the individual and the justice that is their due. I will continue to stand against the injustices that plague our society, for I am an individual, and I will not be silenced.",
            "The following compendium traverses the labyrinthine terrain of Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model, like a grim sentinel, stands watch over the inheritance of genetic information and the physiological aspects of health. In stark contrast, the Sociocultural model casts its gaze upon environmental relationships, their reach extending to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia is a sojourn through these models, each step illuminated by the research chosen to illuminate them, and each finding subjected to a critical eye.\n\nSleep disorders, in their myriad forms, can be characterized as primary, related to another mental disorder, or connected to other issues. The primary sleep disorders, such as Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, stand as the first line of defense against the encroaching darkness of sleeplessness. Those related to mental disorders are but shadows cast by Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders, like ghosts in the night, are born of medical complications or the specter of substance intake. Dyssomnias, with their focus on initiation and maintenance of sleep, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). In the realm of Parasomnias, the nightmares and terrors that beset the sleeping are the haunting echoes of behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders, a grim litany of genes and heritable factors, delves into the physiologically acquired aspects. In the deep, dark chasm of the hypothalamus, neurons containing orexin regulate the dance of sleep and wakefulness. A study of mice, in the language of science, revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, responsible for the states of sleep and wakefulness. The activation of the GABAA receptor, like a soothing lullaby, brings forth sleep. Inhibition of this receptor, as if the silence of a haunted house, reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The application of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time, a beacon of hope in the darkness (Matsuki et al., 2009). This study, like a map to the promised land, implies that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This suggests a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence in this receptor could hinder the ability to sleep unaided by medication. The sociocultural implications, like the echo of a gunshot in the night, suggest that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep. An alteration of the receptor, a glitch in the matrix, would disturb sleep, casting a shadow over the individual's life, tainting their days with the monotony of sleeplessness and the struggle to focus.",
            "The travail of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) unfolds in realms beyond mere audibility. It is not an affliction of the ears, but a malady of the mind, a fracture in the central nervous system's ability to harness and decipher auditory information. The brain, that labyrinthine organ, fails in its duty to translate sound into meaning, leaving those stricken with CAPD to grapple with a world that echoes without substance.\n\nThe origins of this condition can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when researchers first began to unravel the mysteries of \"auditory imperception.\" The path of discovery was marked by the pioneering efforts of researchers like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who in 1954 began to develop tests for children with communicative disorders, and later, by Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing and his model of the physiological activity underlying auditory perception in 1961. A gathering of luminaries in 1977 further fueled the fires of research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of the disorder vary in their cruelty. The afflicted may find it impossible to pinpoint the source of a sound, or to differentiate between acoustic events. They may struggle to recognize patterns in sound, to parse the subtle shifts in speech that betray sarcasm, or to decipher the sequence in which auditory information is presented. Some may find their thoughts disrupted by the intrusion of subsequent sounds.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a complex endeavor, requiring the keen eye and skilled hand of audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. It involves a myriad of tests and measures, from questionnaires and observations to advanced recordings of acoustic signals within the ear. Yet, despite these efforts, a single tool of diagnostic certainty remains elusive, and the root cause of CAPD remains shrouded in mystery.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to imply that, whilst disguise may prove expedient in the art of long deception, it is ultimately a double-edged blade. For, in the inevitable unmasking, a person risks losing their true self. Such a predicament presents a conundrum: the choice between self-preservation and the preservation of relationships, for some may bear the deception with neutrality, whilst others will be offended and seek retribution.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly thorny, for it raises questions of identity and purpose. Why, then, does a person feel the need to shed their true form and don the guise of the opposite sex? In Viola's case, it is clear: a means of self-preservation. With her arrival in a strange land, she conceals her true self to evade potential harm. Her plan succeeds, yet it also isolates her from women, severing a vital support. Worse still, her deception entangles her in romantic complications. Olivia, mistaking her for Sebastian, falls in love with Cesario, and Orsino's suppressed affections for Viola surface.\n\nThis, perhaps, is a progressive stance, but to the modern observer, \"Twelfth Night\" may be seen as a tale of how deception can unveil hidden emotions. Consider Olivia and Orsino's unexpressed desires, possibly stirred by the presence of Viola/Cesario. Is Olivia's love for Cesario rooted in her attraction to men, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? This is a question worth pondering, for Olivia's character seems to embody the shallow judgments of her time. This is evident in her swift changes of heart, from loving Cesario to regarding Viola as a sister.",
            "German colonial rule, in its harshness, is often remembered for the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama of South West Africa. Yet, the empire's broad sweep cannot be accounted for by a single brushstroke. The colonial machine was as varied as the terrain it sought to subjugate. Educational provisions across the colonies mirrored this diversity. When the British assumed control of German East Africa in 1919, they found a populace that was, for the most part, educated and literate. Similarly, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary observers. Yet, South West Africa (what is now Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively engaged in the education of natives, here the task was largely left to missionary societies, receiving scant support from the government. Instead, the colonial state poured resources into educating Europeans, establishing schools and regulating missionary endeavors. These policies left a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other colonies boasted literate African populations, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper intends to delve deeper, identifying these factors and focusing on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans.\nA plethora of literature exists on education under German colonial rule, much of it written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the colonial period. These early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems of the colonies. Later works, in English, expanded upon this discourse, comparing educational systems across the colonies and offering more detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out, comparing the two colonies and discussing the factors that accounted for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a key factor in shaping its educational system.\nSouth West Africa possessed a climate that was moderately temperate, though much of the territory was covered by arid desert. The European population reflected this relative hospitability. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded over the past century, encompassing a multitude of genres, each with its own labyrinth of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. To name a few, there's rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, each a realm unto itself. Among these, Heavy Metal rock, a genre birthed four decades past, stands as one of the most variegated and expressive. It is expressive, for it embraces a spectrum of emotions, albeit largely those that tread the darker path. It is diverse, too, as early pioneers recognized its adaptability, giving rise to an ever-branching tapestry of sub-genres.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has evolved into a vast, almost unfathomable, collection of niches. It has absorbed themes from other genres, yet its roots run deep. To comprehend the metal music that permeates our world today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement, and why it transcends mere genre classification.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement defined by its embrace of darkness. It is a music of extremes - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less simplicity, more virtuosity; metal musicians are true artisans, their skill evident in every note. It is also a movement with a heavy influence of psychedelic drugs. The mid-70s' drug boom led to a wave of 'crazy' records, the music an outlet for the artists' otherworldly experiences. It possesses a raw, visceral quality, a stark contrast to much of the music of the time, which often shied away from the darker spectrum of emotion. Later generations have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as these from Helter Skelter, by the Beatles, exhibit this darkness. Often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, it was a response to a Rolling Stones track, an attempt to match their heavier, darker sound. The Beatles, it seems, were eager to prove they could be just as heavy as the Stones.",
            "In the waning years of the nineteenth century, long before the Surrealists began to whisk their dreams onto canvas, a man named Henri Rousseau was weaving his own visions into his art. The Dream, a painting from 1910, is not merely a depiction of a woman captivated by a dreamt landscape, but a mirror to Rousseau's own aspirations and the turmoil that swirled within him. He yearned for acceptance, for praise, for a place among the esteemed artists he revered. Yet, he found himself at a crossroads, torn between the path of conformity and the lure of his own unique voice.\n\nTo truly understand The Dream, one must first delve into the life of this self-taught painter. Born in the bleak town of Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau hailed from humble beginnings, his father a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Formal art training eluded him, but he found his way into the world of art through his work as a gabelou, later living with the moniker douanier, a customs inspector. The death of his wife and eight children added to his burden, and he sought solace in painting, yearning for a new life.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance was not misplaced. He was late to the art world, uneducated in the intricacies of painting, and faced the daunting task of making his mark amidst a sea of talented contemporaries. It was only when his career was well underway that recognition began to surface, around the same time that Henri Matisse was making his name. Yet, there was a stark difference between these two painters, as noted by Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters. Matisse sought to avoid clichés, while Rousseau yearned for the conventional, hoping that his work, so ordinary, would gain him entry into the esteemed circle of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the shadowed corners of knowledge, many a sage has whispered of a union between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I hold that this nexus is not merely a coincidence, but a symbiosis as ancient as the earth itself. As Keats intones in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of life's wisdom is imparted through the schoolmaster's tongue or the fractious road, yet we find ourselves drawn to the ethical and the aesthetically pleasing without being led by these guides. Both ethics and aesthetics are but attempts to unravel the tapestry of existence, rather than to prescribe the colors on the loom. Our musings on morality and beauty are chiefly exercises in explication, not dictate.\n\nMore often than not, the critical eye fails to grasp the very essence of the good or the beautiful. A discourse on the Mona Lisa's worth may dwell upon such minutiae as fore and afterground, contrast's dance, or cultural context's sway, but in the end, these are but shadows cast by the masterpiece's light. True appreciation, it seems, begins with a whisper — \"There's just something...\" — before the more complex or critical explanation takes flight. Both art and morality, I believe, elude complete description. As O'Connor reminds us, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how meticulously we catalog a tome's properties, there remains a whisper of the ineffable. So too with morality.\n\nI postulate that the moral and the artistic are so intertwined because they strike us at a level both experienced and inexplicable, a realm that Kant would call noumenal. Their kinship is strongest in the art of literature. As McKean observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the resplendent heart of today's Germany, a coalescence of cultures unfurls, from the alpine shadows of München to the Baltic's embrace in Kiel. This tapestry, woven with threads of myriad hues, is felt from Köln by the Rhine, through the country's very soul, to the Saxon city of Dresden, whose Elbe river carves its path. Such an amalgamation of culture should not be a surprise, for Germany's formative years were shaped by the fusion of disparate sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the cradle of the German people, bears a name shrouded in mystery. Its origin is a matter of scholarly debate. Tacitus, in his work \"Germania,\" written in 98 AD, proposes that the name emerged from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who had previously been christened \"Germani.\" Others suggest the name derives from the Latin word \"germanus,\" used by Julius Caesar to distinguish between those he conquered, the Gauls, and those he did not, the Germanic tribes. Still others posit that the name may have come from the Old Irish \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' boisterous nature. Whatever the origin, the name has stuck, a testament to the enduring power of language.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et Situ Germanorum,\" penned, \"I should regard the Germans as aboriginal, and not mixed with other races. For, in former times, it was not by land but by sea that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.\" The Romans, too, were drawn to Germania, not for its warmth or grandeur, but for its goods and the skill of its warriors within their ranks. Thus, the Germanic tribes, appearing in the first century, found themselves living on the empire's borders, trading their wares and serving in the Roman legions.",
            "Downward my gaze fell, the tableau before me unspooling like a scroll, blank save for the stark lines of reality. Unlabeled, unvarnished, the scene took shape in my consciousness, a landscape of stark simplicity, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, a kitchen in a dining room, all reduced to mere lines and shapes by the unforgiving eye of my mind. Thoughts danced like spiders, weaving and unraveling in the quietude of my thoughts, each one a fleeting visitor, not quite leaving its mark. It was a dance of perception, a ballet of observation, and I was but the spectator, the silent witness to the world laid bare.\n\nBorn with a pencil in hand, I had long yearned to capture the world in lines and color, to wield the tool of creation. The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, a tome of wisdom bestowed upon me by an artist I once knew, had become my guide, a roadmap to the labyrinth of the mind where the pencil meets the canvas. It taught me to frame the world, to reduce the complexity of a scene to its most essential parts, to see the simple shape within the chaos.\n\nIn that moment, the bowl of fruit, the kitchen, the dining room, they were more than just a scene; they were a canvas, a landscape waiting for the brush of my perception. I was a painter, a sculptor, a creator, and before me lay the first brushstroke, the first line in my story, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched the handle of my chosen implement, a toilet brush, and the world shifted. The smooth water, the swirling vortex, it all became a canvas, a stage for the dance of my hand. I was the puppeteer, and the brush was my marionette, jerking and spasming, dancing in the rhythm of my will. The offending brown package, a testament to the folly of humanity, refused to yield, entrenched as a slug in the depths of the bowl.\n\nThe mop, a loose grip, a stance wide and steady, the green tie knotted against the collar of my shirt, all bore witness to my struggle. The rude bundle of processed matter, a message left for those who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid, was more than just a nuisance. It was a challenge, a test of my resolve, a reminder of the world's imperfections.\n\nMy hand moved, a slow descent, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey, a delicate dance with the abyss. And in that moment, I was not just a cleaner; I was an artist, a creator, a scribe of the world's imperfections.",
            "In the grim crucible of youth, young souls are claimed by the steel and asphalt, their lives snuffed out in the blink of an eye. The National Institutes of Health, in their unyielding pursuit of truth, have illuminated one aspect of this grim dance with death: the teen brain, in its formative state, is not yet equipped to navigate the perils of the open road. This naivety, this innocence, is as much a curse as it is a blessing. It is inexperience that lies at the heart of this calamity, a blindfolded child stumbling into a world of steel and speed.\n\nThe company of peers, a poisoned chalice, amplifies their folly. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has charted a grim correlation: more passengers, more accidents. California and other states have responded with provisional licenses, a Band-Aid on a bleeding wound. But these measures are but a temporary salve, for the truth is stark and unyielding: the youngest drivers, in their entirety, are not yet ready to bear the weight of responsibility.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman, in his cold, clinical gaze, has peered into the abyss and seen a desire for risk that burns bright and fierce. The thrill-seekers, they are called, these children of the digital age, and they are a plague upon the highways. It is wisdom, not folly, that would delay their descent into the crucible of the open road until the fever of youth has begun to subside.\n\nBy 2010, the children of the Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, a fresh wave of inexperienced drivers ready to plunge into the maelstrom. Legislation, it is whispered, could stem this tide. Driver's education in schools, the first steps on the path to wisdom, but no young soul under the age of eighteen should wield the keys to a motor vehicle. A provisional permit, a trial by fire, and a certain number of hours behind the wheel, the number determined by the majority of states. A uniform law, a beacon in the storm, guiding these young souls safely through the perils of the open road.\n\nThis is not a new idea, a fresh dawn. It is a truth whispered in the shadows, a truth that will not be denied.",
            "In perusing the Library of Congress's archive of Edison's earliest cinematic works, I encountered a clutch of fifteen trick films, dating from 1895 to 1901. These films, like their kin from that era, played with the eye's perceptions, employing creative editing to weave illusions. My study, much like a man unearthing ancient secrets, delved into the poetics of these deceptions, with an eye towards the peculiarities that bloomed in the latter years. The trick films of that time, much like the theatre they mimicked, were rooted in the stationary proscenium, with no camera movement, and adhered to the dictum that one shot equaled one film. Yet, there were renegades among them, daring to spurn these rules, introducing the notion of multiple shots.\n\nOne commonality that seeped through these films was their preference for interior sets, framed within a rigid proscenium. The camera, steadfast and unmoving, bore witness to the action that unfolded within its gaze. This, much like the theatre and vaudeville acts that preceded it, dictated the movement of actors, confining them to a horizontal axis. Consider, for instance, the dance of the actors in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). They entered from the right, moved back and forth, and exited, all without the camera's intervention.\n\nThe proscenium style also dictated that shots be long and, less frequently, medium. Close-ups were an anomaly, a stranger in that world. This, too, was a nod to the theatre, where the audience took in the entire performance at once, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors, much like the characters in these films, did not stray from the middle ground, never moving towards or away from the camera's cold eye.\n\nThe films, much like the theatre, often followed the rule that one conceptual shot equaled one film, limiting their duration to a minute or less. This also restricted their dramatic or narrative capabilities, most focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks. Yet, in these films, what the viewer saw as one shot was often a collage of several, the physical shots joined to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. In \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look reveals where the physical shot of Mary's \"head\" begins, though the entire film is perceived as one shot.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and steadfast advocate for the Republican cause. Born an agriculturalist, his life and brief foray into politics forged a man of unwavering dedication and outspoken convictions concerning personal liberties and governance. His deep-rooted belief in an agrarian system underpinned his views on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the young United States as an unparalleled opportunity to craft an ideal society, unencumbered by native traditions that might hinder progress. He revered the natural rights of men, asserting that they were interdependent, and that denying any one would diminish the value of the rest. These rights, he posited, should be beyond the government's grasp. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a harsh realm where the strong and cunning prospered, but civilized society must not replicate this brutality.\n\nTo achieve this utopia, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge and account for man's inherent good and evil. He held fast to a dualistic morality, claiming, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, he posited, protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government rooted in such principles would function equitably, regardless of administrative avarice and self-interest. While recognizing self-interest as man's primary motivation, he deemed it evil only when it subverted the creation of a society based on the public good.\n\nTaylor, like many of his time, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He yearned for a limited Federal government, with no powers beyond those explicitly stated. He understood that an expansive Federal government could become despotic. Yet, he cautioned against a simple, literal interpretation, as it could easily become corrupt without reference to the writers' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, for it more plainly described the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In reviewing Fig. 17, an abrupt decline in commuter log submissions became apparent in the third month of our project. This sudden drop was a discouraging sight, its cause shrouded in mystery. As winter descended upon our New England campus, fewer took to the roads on bicycle or foot, a natural explanation for some of the fall-off. December, too, brought the end of the fall semester - a time when students and faculty alike were engrossed in frantic preparations for the holidays and the processing of grades. Amidst this turmoil, the commuter log may have slipped from their minds. The holiday season, with its extended break, further diminished the need for campus attendance. Classes resumed in late January, perhaps accounting for the low February submissions. Yet none of this fully explains the February slump. It could be surmised that the project's initial fervor had waned, as such initiatives often do.\n\nTo combat this waning enthusiasm, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special blitz aimed at reinvigorating the project. This indeed resulted in an uptick in log submissions. The challenge, however, lay not only in maintaining the project's momentum but also in counteracting the inertia of holiday and semester breaks.\n\nAnother obstacle faced was the inherent allure of driving one's car, deeply ingrained in our culture. To encourage alternative commuting modes, we offered prizes - gift certificates to local eateries, an independent bookstore, and even national chain stores. The idea of larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, was intriguing but untested. If prizes had been increased gradually, say announcing bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, participation might have risen rather than dipped.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a form of security that tracks an index, commodity, or basket of assets much like an index fund, yet it trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification of an index fund coupled with the singular ownership benefits of a stock, such as short selling, margin buying, and the purchase of as little as one share. While these advantages are appealing, they come with a trade-off—ETFs typically charge a commission for each trade, akin to stock orders. Moreover, ETFs boast a wide array of funds, but a discerning investor should evaluate whether these stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent.\n\nFor our examination, we'll focus on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IHF) and compare it to its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of its total assets. Below are the top 10 holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, normalized to 100%. The results are as follows:\n\nFrom these calculations, it is evident that a portfolio composed solely of the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 points lower than the ETF's overall Beta. Thus, it appears that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns with a lower Beta. However, statistical significance between these two portfolios remains to be established.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios differ statistically, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the annals of Edgar Allan Poe's verse, \"Dream-Land\" stands as one of his most haunting compositions. Within its pages, he employs the term \"Thulé,\" echoing a reference from Virgil, who used it to denote an island beyond the known world, north of Britain. Yet, there exists a more contemporary source that must be acknowledged. Poe, it is known, was deeply engrossed in the works of German authors.\n\nThis connection is of great significance, for it reveals Poe's familiarity with the writings of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his meticulous examination of Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" draws a compelling parallel between the two poets' works, concluding that Poe was, indeed, drawing inspiration from Goethe's pen.\n\nGoethe, a luminary in the realm of literary endeavor, penned the tragic verse drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, the first in 1808, and the second in 1832, the year of his passing. Within this latter section lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a king who, grief-stricken by the death of his queen, succumbs to despair and ultimately meets his end. The parallels between this king and the speaker of Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, as if Poe himself had stepped into the shadow of Goethe's own words.\n\nPoe's use of Thulé is not confined to \"Dream-Land\" alone. He references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and employs the term twice more as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" These two poems can be viewed as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" acting as a vivid exploration of the themes and imagery present in Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" The landscape of Thulé, as described by the speaker, is one of darkness, loneliness, and haunting memories of lost friends, a realm devoid of color and life. This description mirrors the despair and desolation felt by the King of Thulé, who, much like the speaker, is haunted by the memory of his deceased queen and the loss of his will to live.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is undeniable, and it is likely that Poe, a man of deep literary admiration, would have been exposed to Goethe's works through the many reproductions circulating at the time. His respect for Tennyson, too, would have led him to explore the works of this celebrated German author.",
            "In the vast expanse of California's legal landscape, the question stands as to whether a patron, after succumbing to the treacherous embrace of an applesauce spill in the belly of D&D's groceries, might find solace in the cold, unyielding justice of punitive damages, given the derelict nature of the store's manager. To walk the plank of this legal inquiry, one must first navigate the treacherous waters of malice, a concept that stirs the souls of judges and lawyers alike.\n\nA judge, wise in the ways of the law, would not lightly dismiss such a claim. To prove that punitive damages are justified, a plaintiff must lay bare the defendant's actions, demonstrating a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would befall others. Jennifer Palmer, our plaintiff, will argue that the defendant, Paul Martin, should have known the peril of his inaction, given the silent sentinels of previous slips and falls that had befallen D&D's patrons. Despite this, Martin stood resolute, his dinner break a testament to his indifference.\n\nOn the thirteenth of October, at the hour of five, an employee named Rich Wayne reported an applesauce spill to Martin, his words echoing in the void of managerial apathy. Martin, consumed by his own appetites, dismissed the matter with a wave of his hand, leaving the spill to fester like an open wound. Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, did her duty and notified Martin again, but the manager's heart remained unmoved. At the stroke of half-past five, the stage was set for disaster as Jennifer Palmer, our unfortunate patron, slipped and fell, her back a casualty of the ignored peril.\n\nThe echoes of these incidents do not stand alone. Five such incidents had already stained the pages of D&D's accident reports in the year that had passed. Yet, Martin, a man of apparent malice, stood by, his conduct a testament to a willful disregard for the safety of his patrons. The law, in its infinite wisdom, has decreed that such conduct, committed with a despicable disregard for the rights and safety of others, is indeed malice.\n\nCalifornia's legal tapestry weaves a thread of malice into its fabric, defining it as conduct that intends harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. Courts have characterized such conduct as malicious when the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions, yet willfully and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences. It is in this light that we must examine the actions of Paul Martin, and the fate that awaits the punitive damage claim of Jennifer Palmer.",
            "Four years past, I encountered a course on the faith of Islam, taught at CBC. The class was a crucible of debate, the chief contention being whether Islam harbors hostility. The pertinence of this inquiry, I now believe, has never been more acute. Since the day of infamy, the mass media's perspective has oscillated wildly, from a hostile view of Islam and its extremists to a state of near-tolerance, a shift that, in 2001, seemed unimaginable. A president like Barack Obama, with a Muslim heritage, would have been inconceivable then.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography piqued my interest. The narrative of Muhammad, as presented, seems at odds with the historical record. The Muhammad I've encountered is a figure of force, compelling tribes to adopt Islam through conquest. Yet, the biography paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and meek. It is this disparity that troubles me. The stories of his 'miracles' share uncanny echoes with those of Jesus. The tale of the multiplying mutton and milk echoes the loaves and fishes. This stylistic choice, I find, serves to diminish the miracle of Jesus, as if the life of Muhammad is a pale imitation.\n\nMoreover, the stories in the biography, while claiming to offer witness, often come from third-party accounts. The narrative of hearsay, of 'so-and-so heard from so-and-so,' diminishes the credibility of the tales, casting doubt on their veracity.\n\nWhat disquiets me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad, to cast him as a godly man, humble and wise. Yet, history tells a different tale. If today's Muslims were to learn the truth of Muhammad's rise, I wonder how it would inform their faith.",
            "The teachings of the man they call Jesus, and the beliefs he held in his mortal days, were swiftly abandoned as Christianity took root upon the earth. The history of this faith, if viewed with a broad, sweeping gaze, reveals a ceaseless drift from its origins. The present world, it seems, is marked by an ever-increasing consciousness and a unprecedentedly progressive spirit. Though traditionalists persist, their influence may yet prove insufficient to sway the whole. Among those who claim the name of Christ, a deepening understanding of history will spread, a yearning to distinguish the doctrines added over time from the true intent of their founder. This reversal is as inevitable as the setting of the sun, a process that will strip away the layers of belief, one by one, like the hands of time ticking backwards, until only the essence of what Jesus brought to the world remains. When this tide of change sweeps across the United States and Europe, it will carry with it a multitude, leading them to worship as if they themselves walked in the time of Jesus, guided by his words alone. The church, in its institutional might, will stand strong, yet the theological clock will have turned back, and the profusion of diversity within Christendom will give way to a uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between sects, between every division, differences will fade away, revealing a singular truth. Human history is rife with such reversals. Once reviled and persecuted, Christianity became the state religion of Rome. The tables have turned since the dark days of African-American slavery, and the tables will turn again in the arena of the Christian faith, seeking the source and undoing the diversity in its wake. But this process will be made possible by a new way of reading Jesus' words, not as literal edicts, but as metaphorical parables. What, then, has transpired since the days of Jesus?\n\nIf we delve far enough into the annals of history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of the Christian faith. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at its core, by the time Rome had seized Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not united in spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "In the grim heart of man, there lies a dark current, an insatiable hunger for gain and power, a selfishness that knows no bounds. This is the truth Upton Sinclair laid bare in his grim tale, \"The Jungle.\" The factory owners and managers, those men with eyes like coal and hearts as cold as the river's flow, saw only their own ambition, their own empire to forge. They cared not for the smoke that choked the lungs of children nor the stench of animal waste that fouled the earth. The very air was rent with the ceaseless din of their industry, a symphony of greed and neglect.\n\nThese leviathans of progress cared not for the men who toiled in their service. \"From the top to the bottom, it was a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair wrote. The men were but cogs in a beastly machine, their lives had no value save in their ability to produce wealth. They were forced to labor in brutal conditions, their bodies and spirits broken by the relentless pace. A sudden layoff, a gleam in the eye of a manager, and multitudes were cast aside like so much refuse. There were no laws to shield these poor souls, no organizations to champion their cause. The unions, they were little more than wolves in sheep's clothing, fleecing the flock they were meant to protect.\n\nThese men, these slaves of the machine, were trapped in a system as unforgiving as the wilderness, as harsh as the winter's frost. They were expected to endure the hell of Packingtown, to accept their fate as a matter of course. There was no escape, no respite, only the endless cycle of toil and despair. Sinclair's words echo with the pitiful cry of a people crushed under the heel of progress: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation, dependent for their opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "In the vast expanse of narrative waters, authors chart diverse courses to evoke sentiments and attitudes toward pivotal subjects. Fitzgerald, with his pen, navigates these waters deftly in \"The Great Gatsby.\" His techniques, both subtle and profound, weave a tapestry that enthralls the reader.\n\nHe pairs nouns and adjectives in ways that dance on the edge of convention, conferring upon the reader a sense of the ethereal. Symbols, too, are his tools, imbued with meaning and wielded to evoke emotions. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald bathes his narrative in hues, each one a whisper of significance: gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.\n\nWhite and gray, his steadfast companions, carry the weight of uniformity. White, a beacon of elegance and refinement, and gray, a whisper of decay and age. Fitzgerald introduces these hues in the novel's opening, a symphony of white: Daisy and Jordan, constant in their pristine attire, and Nick, donning \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party. Even the uninvited Tom wears a \"white shirt\" in his tryst with Myrtle. The city itself is a canvas, with Nick descending into \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" of partygoers etched on his mind. Even the mundane is infused with these hues: Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood,\" the \"gray land\" of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child, and the \"gray old man\" of the dog-seller.\n\nAfter having woven a tale of significance around these hues, Fitzgerald applies them to Daisy, the elusive object of Gatsby's longing. When she emerges in her \"little white roadster,\" she becomes a fixture, a uniform addition to the tapestry of the story. The \"gray haze\" of her fur collar, and her \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter, serve to diminish her character, reducing her to a symbol of Gatsby's desire.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is a masterful dance, a ballet of emotions and significations. He turns the mundane into the profound, the ordinary into the extraordinary, all through the delicate art of imbuing color with meaning.",
            "In the sun-scorched lands of San Diego County, the earth yields bountifully, fed by a benevolent climate that caresses the land in warm embrace. Tomatoes, lemons, and other fruits of the earth swell and ripen under the golden sun, while the earth is nurtured by the hands of those who till her soil. The soil, rich and unspoiled, bears witness to the toil of farmers who tend to it with care, for it is the lifeblood of their existence. This is a land where the line between nature and the human spirit blurs, where the organic certification is a badge of honor, a testament to the respect for the land and its inhabitants.\n\nThe market for such pure, unadulterated produce is robust, with a hunger for the untouched taste of nature's bounty. The demand for organic eggs and milk is insatiable, their consumers craving the simplicity of true sustenance. The landowner, a visionary, sees the potential in this untapped market, a niche where the scales of nature and commerce intersect. Yet, the path to this promised land is fraught with challenges, for the organic farm demands more from its keeper than the conventional fields. It requires a constant vigilance, a ceaseless battle against pest and weed, a delicate dance with the soil to nurture its life and yield its fruits.\n\nThe land in question lies in the shadow of the grand Cleveland National Forest, a parcel of 160 acres that bears the marks of the past. It is a landscape that has known the touch of the Native American hand and the boot of the cattle rancher, a testament to the enduring spirit of the land. It stands in the heart of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, a sanctuary home to a hundred species, many of them endangered, their existence teetering on the precipice of oblivion.\n\nThe ecoregion's conservation plan is still being debated, but the fate of these creatures hangs in the balance. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher all call this land home, their survival intertwined with the health of the land. The landowner, a beacon of hope, seeks to be both a conserver and a creator, a guardian of the past and a visionary of the future. He seeks guidance, a path to balance the scales of profit and preservation, a way to turn the tide for the creatures that call this land home.",
            "Culture, an elusive beast, is both what it is and what it is not. It is not a static thing, nor is it singular. It is a tapestry woven with threads of history, prejudice, and personal experience. To presume that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating is to oversimplify the complex dance of culture. A negotiator would do well to understand the spirit of a culture, its rhythm, and how it will shape the parley.\n\nWhen one steps into the arena of a foreign culture, one does not see only what is present, but also what is absent. One must accept, without judgment, the culture's quirks and idiosyncrasies, for these are the bones of its meaning. Respect for tradition and belief, even in the heart of a stranger's land, can ease the negotiation's passage.\n\nCulture does not confine itself to national borders. Within each nation, companies carve out their own worlds, with unique languages, customs, and beliefs. It is in the dress codes, the manner of speech, the way duties are delegated, and the charities they endorse that one can glimpse a company's culture. Even within the vast expanse of the American corporate landscape, there is diversity, from the relentless to the laissez-faire, from the urban to the suburban.\n\nValues, the heart of a culture, provide its purpose. If face or harmony are valued, a negotiator will not dishonor them. Likewise, if a hard bargain is prized, the urge to settle will be tempered. Before the negotiation, it is wise to understand these values. Yet, to know one's opponent on a personal level can bring a subtle, yet powerful, edge to the parley.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" Thus begins Psalm 14, and so does St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. This sentiment is echoed by another thinker we shall discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Both, so it seems, believe in the same deity, the God of the Bible. To fairly weigh their arguments, we must start with the presumption that both are correct in their belief.\n\nTo sway from this path would be to lose the essence of their arguments, for they each defend a singular God. However, both arguments, despite their merits, fail to provide a comprehensive basis for belief.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument, in its bare bones, posits that God's existence can be found within our own understanding. He suggests that we need not venture beyond our souls to find evidence of Him, but rather to look within. This idea, though convoluted in its articulation, implies that God's existence is self-evident within our own minds. This notion is akin to the Christian concept of faith, wherein acceptance is required in the absence of irrefutable evidence.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach, one might argue, is advantageous for evangelism, as it allows for the recruitment of converts based on logic alone. He presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially posits that the necessity of God can be logically deduced from the world around us.",
            "In the shadows of a distant era, circa the fifth or sixth century before the Common Era, a prince was born, who would one day be known as the Buddha. Over the expanse of his life, he turned his back on the world, attaining enlightenment, and his teachings birthed Buddhism, the most steadfast branch of which is Theravada Buddhism. This religion, now some twenty-five hundred years old, bears little resemblance to its origins, as evidenced by the annual water-cutting ceremony in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka. Monks and laymen alike partake in this ritual, though the Buddha himself never spoke of such festivities. These deviations stretch from superficial traditions to the very heart of the religion's soteriological core. The Theravada Buddhist community, from the cloister to the hearth, has had to alter its doctrinal tenets over the centuries, driven by forces both internal and external, hostile and benign.\n\nTo navigate this discussion, we must understand several qualifying terms. Internal forces are those born within the fold of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their status. External forces originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or damage the Buddhist community, driven by a malicious perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, while not necessarily seeking to help or hinder, may inadvertently do so.\n\nFirst, let us delve into the essentials of the religion—the doctrines that form the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the essence of doctrine, is composed of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka comprises the metaphysical components. These include Anatta, the absence of a fixed soul; Dukkha, the inherent suffering of life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Recognizing these concepts allows one to break free of Sansara, the cycle of birth and rebirth, and thereby end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, and achieve enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, five for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not indulge in intoxicating substances), and many more for monks. The most fundamental doctrinal notion is the four noble truths: First, the truth of suffering, Dukkha; second, the truth that attachment causes suffering; third, the truth that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico, once bound in a protracted rivalry that spanned fifty-seven years, from 1836 to 1893, bear witness to a feud that has echoed through history. The zenith of this enmity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States, with a swift and decisive blow, vanquished Mexico and laid claim to Texas and the American Southwest, new fields for the hungry nation. The tension did not dissipate with this single conflict; it simmered, a boil beneath the surface, until the Great War put an end to it (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The root of this animosity was as much about material interests as it was about differing beliefs, a clash of cultures and traditions, a rift between the Protestant and the Catholic (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis is not an anomaly, but a common tale told among nations that share a border, their interests intertwined in a dance of power and aspiration. The United States and Mexico are but two among many pairs of neighboring nations, bound by proximity and adversity. David M. Pletcher (1977) posits, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, these two nations, geographically close to the United States, have been entangled in a web of rivalry, while others in Latin America have enjoyed a more amicable relationship.\n\nReligious differences, a familiar foe to many a nation, have strained the bond between the United States and Mexico. Sally Frahm (2001) asserts, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). The ideological struggle between the United States and Mexico was not merely a contest of political ideologies, but a clash of religious persuasions. This enmity was a relic of the historic distrust between the English and Spanish, a legacy that impeded the establishment of cordial diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States during this fifty-seven-year period. Most of these disputes were territorial in nature, born of raids from Mexican territory into American soil and other frontier problems (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). The border was a frontier, a wild and unpredictable place, where outlaws and bandits operated with impunity, their raids a constant threat until both nations exerted military force to tame the wildlands.\n\nSchmitt (1974) attests that the rivalry began to abate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, a shift that culminated in American ambitions moving from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico, marking the end of an era in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen‭ ‬years passed since the illness, uninvited and unforeseen,‭ ‬seized me with an iron grip,‭ ‬rendering me unable to tend to the bodies I‭'d‭ ‬once cared for as a nurse. I was a‭ ‬child of uncertainty,‭ ‬and the voice of certainty in my life was the whispered promise‭: \"You'll always find work, people will always need tending.\" So,‭ ‬despite my heart yearning for the lab or the newsroom,‭ ‬I found solace in the steady rhythm of the sickroom. At forty-six,‭ ‬single,‭ ‬and destitute,‭ ‬I am now a stranger to my own body and my life a relentless,‭ ‬daily struggle. My Social Security Disability has seen to it that I am not starving,‭ ‬but the pride and security of self-sufficiency have long since fled. I am a man adrift,‭ ‬but not alone in my tumultuous sea. My family and a few steadfast friends have been my anchor,‭ ‬their kindness my only certainty in this storm.\n\nThe truth remains,‭ ‬life is a tapestry of emergencies,‭ ‬both large and small,‭ ‬and no amount of preparation can shield from the unexpected. I agree,‭ ‬the government is a decrepit,‭ ‬rotting beast,‭ ‬but I see no need to abandon it entirely.‭ ‬Instead,‭ ‬I long for a nation of mutual respect,‭ ‬one that trusts in the strength of community. The rugged individualism that once defined us‭ ‬was not the force that carried us through,‭ ‬but compassion and unity.

            "In the shadowed recesses of existence, where the unseen tendrils of evolution stretch, the question gnaws at the mind: Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there boundaries or shackles that guide the dance of change? D'Arcy Thompson, in his 1917 musings, whispered that even the simplest organic forms eluded the grasp of mathematical language. Yet, in this age, the call of numbers has echoed, beckoning us towards clarity. Our quest delves into the mathematical modeling of Prunum, a mollusk, through the prism of ontogeny and phylogeny. X-rays have laid bare the quantifiable parameters of these shells, which we have fed into CerioShell, a software that mimics the dance of growth. We have sketched hypothetical morphologies, the boundaries of possibility in this stained-glass world of shell. The echoes of our mathematical whispers are harmonizing with the rhythm of experimental and descriptive studies, seeking to understand the macroevolutionary symphony of Prunum.\n\nA shell, a tube that traverses the circular dance of time, its turns or whorls spiraling around an axis, the columella, unyielding and central. The speed of enlargement varies, a continuous line separating each whorl, a suture. The largest whorl, the body whorl, stands sentinel at the end, the spire stretching back to the apex, its opposite end the base, the aperture, the gateway to the world beyond. The aperture, a window into the shell's journey through time and space, its path traced by coordinates, a mathematical ballet of growth.\n\nThis trajectory, once graphed and quantified, allows for parameters to be varied, the skeletogenesis of the mollusk to be remade in the crucible of numbers.",
            "In the realm where the sun scorches the earth and the shadows dance with drought, the specter of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained a sullen and unyielding presence for a decade. The nation, a behemoth of ambition, strides toward the goals set forth by the Millennium Development, yet the pace of progress in the realm of child and maternal health remains a desolate and desolate march. The reasons for this languor are manifold, and they whisper of a need to bolster the very heart of the health system, rather than to bandage the wounds of its surface.\n\nThe birth of a child in Indonesia now sees the hand of a skilled laborer seventy-two percent of the time, a feat that should be lauded. Yet, this tally includes hands that wield no more than the ancient arts of the midwife, a blade that cannot staunch the river of blood that claims so many mothers. The mothers' grievous plight is not confined to their bodies, for the care of their infants is also wanting. The number of children under five who have sought professional care for diarrhea has declined, their cries echoing through empty clinics. The data on postnatal care is as elusive as the rain in a desert, and it whispers of woe.\n\nThe blade of the scalpel, that instrument of rebirth, is wielded but a mere four percent of the time. The chasm of inequity yawns wide, with cities enjoying a c-section rate of seven percent, while the rural jungle sees a rate of but two. The cities of glass and steel, they gleam with the light of health, while the children of the countryside are left in the shadows. The poor, too, are left to wither, their cries for aid unheeded, their purses bare of coin.\n\nIn the labyrinth of solutions, the question that echoes is this: how best to slay the beast of scarcity? Should the nation focus its gaze on the wounds of the body, or should it seek to strengthen the very heart that pumps life's blood? The siren call of programmatic approaches is strong, their promises of swift and certain results a sweet melody. Yet, they are a double-edged blade, for they too often draw resources away from the slender thread of the overall health system. The ghost of HIV/AIDS, a specter of the past, whispers of the family planning sector's withered husk. The dance of duplication and disarray, a shadow play of forms and paperwork, is a price too high to pay.",
            "Victorian novels are typically marked by their meticulous attention to detail and their preoccupation with the aristocracy of the time. Yet, two notable outliers from this tradition are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" These works diverge with their unusual blend of mystery and the bizarre, qualities uncommon in the period. This blend serves to deepen the characters within each novel, granting insight into their motivations and emotions. In \"Oliver Twist,\" the protagonist experiences a shooting that is revisited in his mind, not as a memory, but as a vivid dream. This repeated vision underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfold, as well as his dire health situation. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit during the shooting reveal his desperation and the constant, tormenting pain that he endures. This scene emphasizes his inability to gain control or even attempt to influence the outcome of his fate, highlighting the growing sense of defeat that seems to be seeping into his psyche, perhaps instilled by Fagin himself. The shooting, therefore, reinforces the notion that Oliver's life is increasingly beyond his control. This sense of fate is further emphasized in the novel's portrayal of time, where \"the day passed off\" not as a usual passage of time, but as a fleeting, dreadful eternity.\n\n“In the midst of his thoughts, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas assailed him. He found himself still walking between Sikes and Crackit, their angry dispute echoing in his mind as if they were arguing right before him. When he turned his attention to himself, he realized he was conversing with them… Suddenly, he started at the report of a firearm; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through these rapid visions, an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain tormented him incessantly.”\n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThe mystery in these novels often emerges through dreamlike sequences, with different content and purposes in each case. In \"Oliver Twist,\" such sequences reveal insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his sources of pain, and his understanding of the world around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in Chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that transpire, as well as the dire straits his health has fallen into, reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbs all his senses, as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he endures his despair once more, removed from the initial shock of pain, as the pain now persists, linked with fear instead of surprise. With Oliver overwhelmed, questions arise about whose will brought about his misfortune, for it certainly was not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is in jeopardy. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.”",
            "Some time ago, I found myself in the role of a tutor at an after-school program, tasked with assisting elementary-aged students in their academic endeavors. Though I was not unskilled in the art of instruction, my abilities were most keenly felt in the realm of English and reading. I was summoned by one of the instructors to aid a young boy named Adrian, who seemed to flounder in the sea of letters. His difficulties were singularly peculiar; some letters he pronounced with ease, while others eluded him entirely. In his case, the boy possessed a silver tongue in English, yet his grasp of the alphabet was as tenuous as the grasp of a child on a rope. It was during this time that I was privileged to meet Adrian's mother, a woman who spoke naught but Spanish. My own command of the language was as yet unrefined, but we managed to carve a path through the linguistic labyrinth before us. It was then that it struck me like a bullet from a gun; Adrian was not illiterate, but his alphabet was as foreign to him as the moon to the earth.\n\nI recount this tale to shed light on the murky waters of language barriers in our schools, particularly in the vast expanse of California. It is a problem that is not always as apparent as we might suspect. A child who speaks English with the fluency of a native-born speaker may still find the act of reading to be as opaque as a foggy night. This is a reality that we must acknowledge and address, for it is a problem that exists. In Adrian's case, the solution was a straightforward one; tutoring in English reading, with a particular focus on the alphabet and its pronunciation. But for the many children who speak English as a second language, the solution is as complex as a labyrinth.\n\nThe dual language system, to my mind, is a commendable endeavor. It is not merely for those whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Children who partake in such programs have been found to excel academically. Yet, there is a specter of fear that hovers over this idea, that it is a waste of resources, that the majority will gain no benefit. This is a fallacy. If we were to implement such programs in our classrooms, all children would stand to benefit. But how do we achieve this? Should we mandate that all teachers possess a mastery of two languages? Certainly not. This would be a burden too great to bear. Yet, I believe there is no reason why we cannot have bilingual aides, tutors, or whatever term one might choose to employ.",
            "From the moment we stand before the vastness of this world, it is whispered to us that there is something greater than ourselves, beyond our grasp. Some are sent to church, others to temple, and a few delve deep within themselves in search of truth. Many accept the faith of their fathers, while others cast it aside as a vain pursuit. Each of us, in our own way, seek to define a part of ourselves through a unique perspective on the divine. We yearn for a light in the dark, a path out of shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him of his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain drumming on the tin roof above, and we smoked our cigarettes in silence. The gutters wept, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. His gaze was one of searching and remembering, his body thinner, clothes loose, hair sparse. I felt alone, afraid, and incapable of speaking of my loss. I hugged him, drew my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall on the June twilight.\n\nMy father slipped away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatment had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost, I could not fathom. I found myself questioning the nature of a God who would allow such cruelty. Yet, in the dark, I offered no prayer. If such a being existed, I thought, He had long ceased listening to me.\n\nI did not wish to witness his passing from this world into another. I could not bear to see the life that had birthed me fade away. I chose to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I curled into a ball in my bed and waited, for three days, for the silence to speak. But it did not.\n\nNo call came.",
            "The Gothic novel, in both essence and nomenclature, is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt posits in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. It has been both reviled and revered, accused of shallowness, and lauded for its \"terrible sublime\" allure (Burke). The original Gothic novel, Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, synthesized the ancient and modern romance to forge a new literary path. Walpole employed theatrical elements of yore and modern mimicry of nature to present his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre retains echoes of medieval theater, architecture, and traditions, even as the term \"gothic\" was used to describe diverse races, styles, and epochs. It was seen as archaic, unsophisticated in the face of modern societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's personal narrative allowed it to endure, to become both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nA pivotal aspect of Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry—the training of a proper knight—lives on, transmuted in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry resonated with Gothic writers, representing the brave, honorable, competent knight and the perceived lack thereof in contemporary society. Through chivalric imagery, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the Gothic's evolution into the Romantic. Walpole, amidst political turmoil and unjust accusations, may have grown disillusioned with the moral decay of his time. He may have yearned for the supposed goodness and morality of the Gothic age, a sentiment reflected in his characters. Consider Frederic, described as:",
            "Supply chain management, a term coined by the consultant Keith Oliver in '82, is the ceaseless flow of processes that carry goods from the customer's order through the raw materials, supply, production, and ultimately, distribution to the customer's hands. It entails the planning, implementation, and oversight of the chain's activities to meet the customer's demands swiftly and efficiently. Six are the sentinels that stand guard over this intricate dance: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the pillars on which business managers erect their strategies to serve the customer best.\n\nThe first step in this ballet is production. It is the very bedrock upon which the entire edifice rests. It is here that managers must divine the customers' desires, and the market is the oracle from which they seek enlightenment. Once the market's whispers are understood, decisions are made: what to produce, and in what quantities. The location of the production is then determined, weighing volume and quality against the customer's need and satisfaction. The dance of production is a rigorous one, with every step requiring meticulous planning. A single misstep can cost the company dearly in time and coin. I, who have toiled in the halls of Wal-Mart and Target, have seen firsthand the importance of designed processes. Uniforms, shipments, every detail is laid out in a meticulous booklet to ensure smooth operation without the confusion of direction or expectation.\n\nThe second sentinel is supply, a strategic decision that molds the core capabilities of a facility and forges outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager's task is to choose the division that best suits the product's processes. Outsourcing, a choice often made for velocity, offers the promise of quality and flexibility while reducing costs or maintaining them at a low level.",
            "In the shattered remnants of a once-great plain, a sign stands, its dull surface bearing a grim message: Hitler lives. A lone figure, a child of the screen, holds the shabby placard aloft, her eyes reflecting the despair of the forgotten. The shadows of Burmese jungles whisper of a land torn asunder by a grasping fist, a junta's grip that clutches at the throat of a nation. The color of their robes, saffron, is the hue of their revolution, a defiant cry in the face of tyranny. Monks, the guardians of the spirit, took to the streets, their voices echoing the silent prayers of a people long denied their voice. The world watched, unblinking, as the fist of the junta tightened, monasteries burned, and journalists, like the poor Kenji Nagai, fell beneath the heel.\n\nThis is not a tale of distant shores, nor a relic of ages past. It is the dark reflection of a world where authority and power cling like plague, their tentacles reaching into the hearts of men. From the halls of Rome to the streets of Beijing, the cry of the oppressed is a haunting symphony of suffering. The echoes of Tiananmen's square, where the courage of a generation was silenced by the roar of tanks, ring through the generations. In Rwanda, shadows danced with blood as the scourge of genocide stalked the land. And in the camps of the Third Reich, the chill of death blew through the barbed wire, a bitter wind of despair.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in the realm of jazz is not merely due to his longevity, but also his uncanny ability to mold his ensemble into a living, breathing beast, each member a distinct instrument in a symphony of sound. His pianistic touch, though subtle, is the guiding hand that orchestrates the symphony, crafting textures that highlight the unique voices of his band. Ellington's compositions, a tapestry of intricate notes and harmonies, provide a framework for improvisation, where soloists can weave their melodies as freely as a river carves its path.\n\nHis masterful understanding of each player's sound, and how they coalesce into a cohesive whole, has resulted in some of the most revolutionary pieces in jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary pays homage to this genius, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as a testament to his use of the human voice as an instrument, a technique that would become a signature of his style.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" Ellington's use of voice and reeds in a call-and-response dance is a masterclass in orchestration. Six choruses, each a delicate dance of tone and texture, showcase his innovation. The first chorus begins with a smooth, melodic voice, transitioning to a rougher sound, a stark contrast that echoes the piece's blues roots. Muted trumpet and clarinet solos, in the second and third choruses, elaborate on the melody, painting with the colors of blue notes and high register sweeps. The fourth chorus sees the band echoing the first, while the fifth, a climactic chorus, sees the reeds take the lead in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with the voice adopting a \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. The piece concludes with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending, a symphonic finale that underscores Ellington's mastery of tone color.\n\nEllington's skill in tight orchestration and ear for tone is on full display in \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" recorded a year later. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he combines the muted trumpet of \"Bubber\" Miley and Baby Cox's scat singing, merging vocal elements of the trumpet with instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. In the latter, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduction of the melody is a tour de force, a testament to Ellington's ability to draw out the unique sound of each instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice and tone to add depth and color is a stylistic trait that permeates his work, a constant reminder of his genius.",
            "She'd always felt the absence of something, a void that gnawed at her like a bad tooth. It began when she first crossed into that murky territory of adolescence. Three years hence, at seventeen, it remained, more insistent than ever. She'd thought it was something she could grasp, a thing she could claim as her own. Boys, girls, it mattered not. None had roused her interest, though they'd tried, clumsy and awkward as they were. She'd questioned this strangeness, turned it over in her mind like a stone, but found no answers that satisfied. So she lived, a stranger to her own desires.\n\nHome, usually a sanctuary, was quiet today. Her parents, they moved through life like old cattle, placid and unruffled. They argued seldom, and when they did, it was with her, their spirited daughter. Independence, they called it. She'd given them no peace, and they'd given her none. Yet, they'd made a good life, this calm couple and their storm of a daughter.\n\nThen came that scream, a sudden cry that sliced through the silence. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart pounding against her ribcage. Her mother lay on the floor, gasping, the word \"ow\" repeating like a mantra. She knelt, her hands hovering, unsure. \"Mom...?\" she whispered. Her mother's eyes fluttered open, unfocused. \"Ow... sweet... take... me... to... the... hospital.\" The words were torn from her, like strips of fabric. Her daughter nodded, her hands finding purchase. She lifted her mother, the weight surprising, and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital, a place of antiseptic and shadows, was a foreign world. She navigated its corridors, her mother a silent burden, until they reached the emergency room. A bed was rolled up, and her mother was transferred, her daughter left to stand alone, her heart a drum in her chest.\n\nHer mother had fallen, that was all. A simple accident, a broken thing. But in that moment, under the harsh glare of the hospital lights, it felt like a world had ended.",
            "In the annals of the scholarly endeavor, a study was undertaken to illuminate the correlation between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" and the mitigated risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, as well as the mortality thereof. The diet, hereafter referred to as the Mediterranean variant (Med variant), is a variant of the traditional Mediterranean Diet, characterized by an elevated consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while eschewing potatoes; it also prescribes a preference for monounsaturated fats over saturated fats, a prominent inclusion of fish, and a judicious consumption of animal products and saturated fats, with a moderate allowance for alcohol.\n\nPrevious investigations had established an inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, as well as the superiority of the Mediterranean Diet over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the overweight and obese. However, these studies, with their singular focus, had not delved into the realm of stroke and stroke-related mortality.\n\nThe present study, a retrospective longitudinal examination, followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes, participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a longitudinal cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across eleven states within the United States. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed the Med variant score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than ninety-five percent of the nurses persisted in their participation over the two-decade period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of coronary heart disease, fatal coronary heart disease, and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In instances where such records were not available, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately seventeen percent of all strokes and twenty-four percent of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified.\n\nTo mitigate random variation for each individual and more accurately represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the Med variant score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could obfuscate results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the association between the Med variant score and the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke was assessed, employing separate models for fatal and nonfatal instances of coronary heart disease and stroke.\n\nIt was found that an augmented adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as reflected by a higher Med variant diet score, was correlated with a diminished risk of incident coronary heart disease and stroke in women. Over the course of twenty years, 2391 incident cases of coronary heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined fatal coronary heart disease and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest quintile of the Med variant diet score exhibited a lower risk for both coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the year 2007, a fateful storm swept through the land of the United States, a financial tempest that left the country reeling, its economy laid low. Jobs withered on the vine, the once-proud architecture of the housing market crumbled to dust, and great corporations, pillars of the nation, were brought to their knees, their empires reduced to naught but shattered remnants. The wound remains fresh, the question persists: how did this calamity befall us, and how do we turn back the tide? The roots of this financial crisis lie in the hearts of men, in decisions made with eyes turned inward, not outward. Banks and firms, driven by greed and naivety, extended credit to those unworthy, burdening them with sub-prime loans. The infrastructure of our financial system, immature and insufficient, buckled under the weight.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown in the year of our Lord nineteen ninety-nine, during the reign of the Clinton presidency. The man in the White House, his sights set on another term, chose to loosen the shackles that bound the banks. The banks, freed, ran amok, their greed unchecked. The New York Times, in its wisdom, foretold the doom that would follow. \"Fannie Mae,\" it wrote, \"has been under increasing pressure from the White House and its shareholders to expand mortgage loans to the least fortunate among us.\" The words of the prophet were true. The storm was coming, a storm of ill-advised lending that would lead to the downfall of the nation.\n\nThe financial markets were a labyrinth, a twisting, turning path of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. The more these instruments intertwined, the more the economy became enmeshed in the housing market. And so, the nation's households and financial markets alike overleaned, exposed to the slightest of breezes. And when the bubble burst, the financial institutions that had bought into this folly were left with naught but the bitter taste of defeat.\n\nIn the end, the top five investment banks stood before the nation, their debts at $4.1 trillion, a figure that accounted for nearly a third of the country's GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers crumbled like a house of cards, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to don the mantle of commercial banks, their wings clipped by the heavy hand of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, the great titans of mortgage debt, stood at $5 trillion, their heads bowed under the weight of government control, brought low by the storm they had helped to unleash.",
            "Ah, the dreaded exposition. That infernal stretch of prose where the author attempts to unfurl his or her wings, only to find them clipped by the relentless tide of information. It's the difference between a soaring eagle and a crashing insect, a symphony and a cacophony. Dr. Merlin, in her wisdom, has uttered oaths at her keyboard when she finds herself ensnared in the morass of Too Much Information, a predicament not so delightful as one might imagine.\n\nExposition, my dear reader, is not your ally. We have all heard the dictum, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin herself has been ensnared in its clutches, entangled in webs of words that lead nowhere or, worse, nowhere fast. Exposition, that insidious whisperer, beckons for us to get the story out of the way, to hurry through the mundane details that, in the grand theater of life, are never so simple.\n\nTake, for instance, the tale of a heroine and her beloved. You might be told they met at a certain place and time, wed in a grand ceremony, and that her husband met his demise before her eyes. You would not expect this tale to be told in a breath, nor would you wish to read two pages of unexceptional prose, during which both parties speak nary a single word. You would expect, nay, demand, that the author paint their portraits in broad and vivid strokes, that you witness the husband's love for his wife through his words and deeds, and that the heroine reveal her thoughts and dreams through the prism of his life.\n\nFor it is not enough to simply know they met, they married, he died. You must feel it, as if you yourself stood there, witnessed their love bloom, wither, and die. You must mourn his loss with her, and in doing so, become entwined in her fate.\n\nYet, it is tempting to rush. To introduce a new character and simply state his past, his present, his dreams. To give him a simple biography rather than a life. Dr. Merlin herself has been tempted, and thus, she implores you, dear writer, to resist the siren call of the simple sentence. To provide the meat, not just the bone.",
            "I sat through two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, as they flickered across my screen. The first, from NBC 4, was live and aired on the thirteenth day of August, 2011. The lead story was of a man, Shad Hostettler, who had slit the throat of his wife in Ashley. The newscaster, his voice a monotone, rattled off the name and the gruesome act, presenting a mugshot that seemed to beckon pure malice. They lingered on him for two minutes, a grim silence hanging heavy in the air, before moving on.\n\nThe second tale was of a youth, Travis Buyers, who had been caught in the crossfire of Sharon Woods. Shot and critically wounded, he lay there, a pawn in a dance of violence. The SWAT team was called, but no arrests made, no suspects named. The story was brief, no more than a whisper, but I've seen this before - a black life snuffed out, a shadow brushed aside.\n\nThe rain and thunderstorms predicted for the weekend were next, a weather forecast that was as dark as the other stories. The temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties, a tepid promise of warmth.\n\nThe final story was of a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, wearing a hoodie, was the culprit. They lingered on his race, his skin's hue, his height and weight. It was an odd disproportion, a focus that seemed to serve no purpose.\n\nThen came the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin convicted of distributing marijuana across the border. Instead of years, the sentence was spoken in months, a harsh, cold number - three hundred. His ethnicity was mentioned, a detail that seemed to cling to the story like a shadow.",
            "There lies an indomitable, unyielding bond between brothers, a bond that runs deeper than the roots of the ancient oak. Within this bond, a labyrinth of emotions unfurls - love, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Brothers comprehend each other in ways that others never can, and in the eyes of their kin, they see not a reflection of their own image, but the truth of their soul laid bare. When the storm of life rages, it is here that the true nature of this bond is revealed, shining through like a beacon in the darkest night. The cost of these emotions, born of blood and bone, must be paid, and paid dearly. To understand the heart of this fraternal tie is to grapple with the consequences it bears. In the brother's gaze, one sees not the world as others see it, but as it truly is, stripped of all pretense. It is in their deeds and the fallout that follows that their true character is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers traverse this theme, and the tumultuous emotions that attend it. Through landscapes teeming with life and vivid imagery, these two boys embark on a journey that is as futile as it is profound. Bitterness and exultation clash in their final, fateful encounter, and only one brother emerges from the ashes. The theme is woven through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which imparts the complex feelings of the protagonist and his view of the world, both of which shape his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be distilled to a single emotion: pride. From their first foray together, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his brother, Doodle. He yearned for a sibling to impart his worldly knowledge upon, to race with to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine's embrace. Yet, Doodle's frail heart and condition made these dreams a mockery. The protagonist, his head filled with wild notions, found these aspirations shattered in an instant. He even considered extinguishing the life that had so dashed his hopes, contemplating to smother Doodle with a pillow. But the small child's smile, that simple act, gave him hope. This shows that his resolve was not unyielding. In the depths of his heart, he harbored an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the silent, ceaseless hum of thought, the human brain, a labyrinth of circuitry and pulsating flesh, labors. As the world has advanced, so too have the metaphors we employ to grasp its workings. From the wax tablet, to the papyrus scroll, to the bound book, we've sought to comprehend this enigmatic organ. Yet, these metaphors bear the weight of their own limitations, like the ghosts of former knowledge haunting the present.\n\nThe brain's journey begins with the harbingers of sense - the eyes, ears, skin, and tongue - transforming the world's raw signals into electrochemical whispers. These whispers are shaped anew by the brain's algorithms, a relentless dance of bottom-up and top-down processing. In the tapestry of perception, the simplest threads of color, shape, and light are woven into a whole, the black box on the white background. The top-down process, like a wind through the trees, quickens the recognition, guiding the eye to see not just a shape, but a black box, and not a hole in the white.\n\nAttention, the gatekeeper, decides what whispers to let through. In the cacophony of life, it filters out the unimportant, the inconsequential, the mere rustling of grass. Yet, like a hound on the scent, it can single out the crucial, the familiar, the name spoken in the din of a room.\n\nTo process, the brain must first store. There are the fleeting, ephemeral memories of sensory experience, the short memory holding space for a fleeting moment, and the vast, enduring store of long-term memory, where information is etched into the structures of proteins, like words carved into stone.\n\nThe brain's knowledge, it's said, is organized in a grand web of associations, nodes of thought linked by the threads of relatedness. In this intricate design, a chair, as if by some unseen hand, is linked to a table, to the grain of wood, to the very essence of these things.",
            "In the grim tale of Aldous Huxley, \"Brave New World,\" the specter of both technological advancement and the capitalist system it engenders looms large, casting a dystopian shadow over the future. The inhabitants of this world value the collective over the individual, their minds conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification as the ultimate pursuit. They are but pawns in a grand game, their fates dictated by the World Controller, who weaves their ideologies as a spider does its web.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist critique, Huxley's reservations about the burgeoning economic order become starkly apparent. Terms such as homogenization and reification echo through the narrative, highlighting the author's disdain for the emerging economic structure of his time. Capitalism is ridiculed through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common folk are blinded to their true relationship to the economic classes, their minds fixated on self-interest and the fleeting pleasures of consumption.\n\nThe common classes, Delta, Gamma and their like, are as much slaves to their conditioning as they are to their station in life. Hypnopædia, the state's system of sleep learning, reinforces this. The World Controller, the puppeteer pulling the strings, manipulates their desires, their wants, their very identities. Hegemony is the tool he wields, subjugating the lower classes to the whims of the upper, who, despite their awareness, do little to resist.\n\nIn this world, individuality is a foreign concept. Characters, even the most prominent, are little more than ciphers, their depths unplumbed. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the union of technology and capitalism strips man of his free will, his self-expression. Love and its extremes are absent, interactions kept shallow and superficial. Men comment on women's physical attributes, and women discuss their encounters with the same dispassion. The complacency of each class in their societal roles is a stark indication of the socioeconomic oppression of capitalism. They obey their place, their role, their lot, in the grand machine, a testament to the Marxist notion of the proletariat, content in their lot so long as they consume, obey, and stay in line.",
            "I've been a student here at University Park for nigh on two and a half years, or the better part of four and a half semesters. Navigation on this campus can be a trialsome endeavor, a fact that has been etched into my bones since my freshman year. I found myself in an East Halls dormitory, the easternmost outpost of our fair campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The journey from my humble abode in Stuart Hall to classes in distant places like the Willard building could take upwards of a quarter of an hour on foot, and that's not even accounting for the weather, which is as unpredictable as a drunkard's path.\n\nAn aging alum, with more miles on his boots than a traveling salesman, told me of a time when the East Halls were isolated by vast, empty tracts of land. Now, that emptiness has given birth to sports fields, a new Creamery, health services, and apartment blocks, encircling the dorms like a fortress. As our campus swells, so does the challenge of traversing its length and breadth.\n\nThe bicycle, that two-wheeled contraption, is the answer, yet it's not the whole solution. It requires a resolve to ride, and a campus that caters to its needs. I spoke to a friend who recently returned to his bicycle after a hiatus. \"Bikes are the only way,\" he mused, \"for a spell it wasn't fashionable, but it's the way to go.\" The bicycle, alongside a bowl of oatmeal, can carry you far, as I've learned in my journey from off-campus lodgings to Thomas building.\n\nEvery morning, the journey from my home to Thomas can be a twenty-five-minute trudge on foot, but with a bike, it's reduced to a mere five minutes, if one pedals with enough spirit. Yet, Pollock Road, the most direct route, is not always an easy path, be it on two feet or two wheels. Walking, too, has its merits, but I'm in a hurry, and time is a precious commodity.\n\nIf I didn't have my bicycle, the walk would be my only recourse, a journey that would claim an additional 30-40 minutes each way, a loss of over two and a half hours per week. Add to that the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so forth. It's a burden I cannot bear."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I intend to tread a path that leads me to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I shall endeavor to lend aid to those children who have been afflicted by the scourge of abuse and neglect, and to offer support to those families beset by discord. The values that I bring to this endeavor are not mere abstractions but the very essence of my being: service, respect, and a steadfast commitment to the ethical pursuit of improvement in human relationships and my own professional competency. These are not merely the values of a social worker but the cornerstone of my own existence.\n\nI have always been a man possessed of a desire to alleviate the suffering of others, yet the path to this end was obscured by the fog of uncertainty. Throughout my sojourn through high school and college, I have beheld many a soul retreating from their plight in the mire of denial, and a few who have succumbed to false securities. It was this tableau of despair that prompted me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, yet the path to a career remained elusive. Thus, I took a respite upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One sultry summer's day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old lad, his demeanor as anxious as his circumstances. He sought refuge from an abusive home, and I could not turn away from his plight. The next day, I found myself at his parent's doorstep, a stranger bearing a degree in Psychology. The police were powerless, and so I engaged the parents in a conversation that revealed their hearts to be as beaten and bruised as their son's. This encounter seeded the seed of a career in social work, a means to tend to the wounds of family strife.\n\nSocial justice is a value that resonates deeply within me, for our society holds the individual in high esteem, yet we are bound by the chains of conformity. If we mourn the loss of an individual, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual, and I will not be shackled by the expectations of others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I have protested against the injustices that bind us, coloring my hair with the bold hues of defiance, donning attire that reflects my true self, piercing my ears with the rebellion of my spirit, and declaring my alliance with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance. I have fought against racism and discrimination, for I believe in the sanctity of the individual and the justice that is their due. I will continue to stand against the injustices that plague our society, for I am an individual, and I will not be silenced.",
            "The following compendium traverses the labyrinthine terrain of Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model, like a grim sentinel, stands watch over the inheritance of genetic information and the physiological aspects of health. In stark contrast, the Sociocultural model casts its gaze upon environmental relationships, their reach extending to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia is a sojourn through these models, each step illuminated by the research chosen to illuminate them, and each finding subjected to a critical eye.\n\nSleep disorders, in their myriad forms, can be characterized as primary, related to another mental disorder, or connected to other issues. The primary sleep disorders, such as Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, stand as the first line of defense against the encroaching darkness of sleeplessness. Those related to mental disorders are but shadows cast by Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders, like ghosts in the night, are born of medical complications or the specter of substance intake. Dyssomnias, with their focus on initiation and maintenance of sleep, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). In the realm of Parasomnias, the nightmares and terrors that beset the sleeping are the haunting echoes of behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders, a grim litany of genes and heritable factors, delves into the physiologically acquired aspects. In the deep, dark chasm of the hypothalamus, neurons containing orexin regulate the dance of sleep and wakefulness. A study of mice, in the language of science, revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, responsible for the states of sleep and wakefulness. The activation of the GABAA receptor, like a soothing lullaby, brings forth sleep. Inhibition of this receptor, as if the silence of a haunted house, reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The application of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time, a beacon of hope in the darkness (Matsuki et al., 2009). This study, like a map to the promised land, implies that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This suggests a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence in this receptor could hinder the ability to sleep unaided by medication. The sociocultural implications, like the echo of a gunshot in the night, suggest that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep. An alteration of the receptor, a glitch in the matrix, would disturb sleep, casting a shadow over the individual's life, tainting their days with the monotony of sleeplessness and the struggle to focus.",
            "The travail of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) unfolds in realms beyond mere audibility. It is not an affliction of the ears, but a malady of the mind, a fracture in the central nervous system's ability to harness and decipher auditory information. The brain, that labyrinthine organ, fails in its duty to translate sound into meaning, leaving those stricken with CAPD to grapple with a world that echoes without substance.\n\nThe origins of this condition can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when researchers first began to unravel the mysteries of \"auditory imperception.\" The path of discovery was marked by the pioneering efforts of researchers like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who in 1954 began to develop tests for children with communicative disorders, and later, by Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing and his model of the physiological activity underlying auditory perception in 1961. A gathering of luminaries in 1977 further fueled the fires of research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of the disorder vary in their cruelty. The afflicted may find it impossible to pinpoint the source of a sound, or to differentiate between acoustic events. They may struggle to recognize patterns in sound, to parse the subtle shifts in speech that betray sarcasm, or to decipher the sequence in which auditory information is presented. Some may find their thoughts disrupted by the intrusion of subsequent sounds.\n\nThe diagnosis of CAPD is a complex endeavor, requiring the keen eye and skilled hand of audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. It involves a myriad of tests and measures, from questionnaires and observations to advanced recordings of acoustic signals within the ear. Yet, despite these efforts, a single tool of diagnostic certainty remains elusive, and the root cause of CAPD remains shrouded in mystery.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" seems to imply that, whilst disguise may prove expedient in the art of long deception, it is ultimately a double-edged blade. For, in the inevitable unmasking, a person risks losing their true self. Such a predicament presents a conundrum: the choice between self-preservation and the preservation of relationships, for some may bear the deception with neutrality, whilst others will be offended and seek retribution.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly thorny, for it raises questions of identity and purpose. Why, then, does a person feel the need to shed their true form and don the guise of the opposite sex? In Viola's case, it is clear: a means of self-preservation. With her arrival in a strange land, she conceals her true self to evade potential harm. Her plan succeeds, yet it also isolates her from women, severing a vital support. Worse still, her deception entangles her in romantic complications. Olivia, mistaking her for Sebastian, falls in love with Cesario, and Orsino's suppressed affections for Viola surface.\n\nThis, perhaps, is a progressive stance, but to the modern observer, \"Twelfth Night\" may be seen as a tale of how deception can unveil hidden emotions. Consider Olivia and Orsino's unexpressed desires, possibly stirred by the presence of Viola/Cesario. Is Olivia's love for Cesario rooted in her attraction to men, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? This is a question worth pondering, for Olivia's character seems to embody the shallow judgments of her time. This is evident in her swift changes of heart, from loving Cesario to regarding Viola as a sister.",
            "German colonial rule, in its harshness, is often remembered for the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama of South West Africa. Yet, the empire's broad sweep cannot be accounted for by a single brushstroke. The colonial machine was as varied as the terrain it sought to subjugate. Educational provisions across the colonies mirrored this diversity. When the British assumed control of German East Africa in 1919, they found a populace that was, for the most part, educated and literate. Similarly, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary observers. Yet, South West Africa (what is now Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively engaged in the education of natives, here the task was largely left to missionary societies, receiving scant support from the government. Instead, the colonial state poured resources into educating Europeans, establishing schools and regulating missionary endeavors. These policies left a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other colonies boasted literate African populations, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper intends to delve deeper, identifying these factors and focusing on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans.\nA plethora of literature exists on education under German colonial rule, much of it written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the colonial period. These early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems of the colonies. Later works, in English, expanded upon this discourse, comparing educational systems across the colonies and offering more detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out, comparing the two colonies and discussing the factors that accounted for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa was a key factor in shaping its educational system.\nSouth West Africa possessed a climate that was moderately temperate, though much of the territory was covered by arid desert. The European population reflected this relative hospitability. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded over the past century, encompassing a multitude of genres, each with its own labyrinth of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. To name a few, there's rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, each a realm unto itself. Among these, Heavy Metal rock, a genre birthed four decades past, stands as one of the most variegated and expressive. It is expressive, for it embraces a spectrum of emotions, albeit largely those that tread the darker path. It is diverse, too, as early pioneers recognized its adaptability, giving rise to an ever-branching tapestry of sub-genres.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has evolved into a vast, almost unfathomable, collection of niches. It has absorbed themes from other genres, yet its roots run deep. To comprehend the metal music that permeates our world today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement, and why it transcends mere genre classification.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement defined by its embrace of darkness. It is a music of extremes - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less simplicity, more virtuosity; metal musicians are true artisans, their skill evident in every note. It is also a movement with a heavy influence of psychedelic drugs. The mid-70s' drug boom led to a wave of 'crazy' records, the music an outlet for the artists' otherworldly experiences. It possesses a raw, visceral quality, a stark contrast to much of the music of the time, which often shied away from the darker spectrum of emotion. Later generations have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as these from Helter Skelter, by the Beatles, exhibit this darkness. Often cited as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, it was a response to a Rolling Stones track, an attempt to match their heavier, darker sound. The Beatles, it seems, were eager to prove they could be just as heavy as the Stones.",
            "In the waning years of the nineteenth century, long before the Surrealists began to whisk their dreams onto canvas, a man named Henri Rousseau was weaving his own visions into his art. The Dream, a painting from 1910, is not merely a depiction of a woman captivated by a dreamt landscape, but a mirror to Rousseau's own aspirations and the turmoil that swirled within him. He yearned for acceptance, for praise, for a place among the esteemed artists he revered. Yet, he found himself at a crossroads, torn between the path of conformity and the lure of his own unique voice.\n\nTo truly understand The Dream, one must first delve into the life of this self-taught painter. Born in the bleak town of Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau hailed from humble beginnings, his father a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Formal art training eluded him, but he found his way into the world of art through his work as a gabelou, later living with the moniker douanier, a customs inspector. The death of his wife and eight children added to his burden, and he sought solace in painting, yearning for a new life.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance was not misplaced. He was late to the art world, uneducated in the intricacies of painting, and faced the daunting task of making his mark amidst a sea of talented contemporaries. It was only when his career was well underway that recognition began to surface, around the same time that Henri Matisse was making his name. Yet, there was a stark difference between these two painters, as noted by Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters. Matisse sought to avoid clichés, while Rousseau yearned for the conventional, hoping that his work, so ordinary, would gain him entry into the esteemed circle of the Artiste Français.",
            "In the shadowed corners of knowledge, many a sage has whispered of a union between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I hold that this nexus is not merely a coincidence, but a symbiosis as ancient as the earth itself. As Keats intones in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of life's wisdom is imparted through the schoolmaster's tongue or the fractious road, yet we find ourselves drawn to the ethical and the aesthetically pleasing without being led by these guides. Both ethics and aesthetics are but attempts to unravel the tapestry of existence, rather than to prescribe the colors on the loom. Our musings on morality and beauty are chiefly exercises in explication, not dictate.\n\nMore often than not, the critical eye fails to grasp the very essence of the good or the beautiful. A discourse on the Mona Lisa's worth may dwell upon such minutiae as fore and afterground, contrast's dance, or cultural context's sway, but in the end, these are but shadows cast by the masterpiece's light. True appreciation, it seems, begins with a whisper — \"There's just something...\" — before the more complex or critical explanation takes flight. Both art and morality, I believe, elude complete description. As O'Connor reminds us, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how meticulously we catalog a tome's properties, there remains a whisper of the ineffable. So too with morality.\n\nI postulate that the moral and the artistic are so intertwined because they strike us at a level both experienced and inexplicable, a realm that Kant would call noumenal. Their kinship is strongest in the art of literature. As McKean observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the resplendent heart of today's Germany, a coalescence of cultures unfurls, from the alpine shadows of München to the Baltic's embrace in Kiel. This tapestry, woven with threads of myriad hues, is felt from Köln by the Rhine, through the country's very soul, to the Saxon city of Dresden, whose Elbe river carves its path. Such an amalgamation of culture should not be a surprise, for Germany's formative years were shaped by the fusion of disparate sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the cradle of the German people, bears a name shrouded in mystery. Its origin is a matter of scholarly debate. Tacitus, in his work \"Germania,\" written in 98 AD, proposes that the name emerged from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who had previously been christened \"Germani.\" Others suggest the name derives from the Latin word \"germanus,\" used by Julius Caesar to distinguish between those he conquered, the Gauls, and those he did not, the Germanic tribes. Still others posit that the name may have come from the Old Irish \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' boisterous nature. Whatever the origin, the name has stuck, a testament to the enduring power of language.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et Situ Germanorum,\" penned, \"I should regard the Germans as aboriginal, and not mixed with other races. For, in former times, it was not by land but by sea that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.\" The Romans, too, were drawn to Germania, not for its warmth or grandeur, but for its goods and the skill of its warriors within their ranks. Thus, the Germanic tribes, appearing in the first century, found themselves living on the empire's borders, trading their wares and serving in the Roman legions.",
            "Downward my gaze fell, the tableau before me unspooling like a scroll, blank save for the stark lines of reality. Unlabeled, unvarnished, the scene took shape in my consciousness, a landscape of stark simplicity, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, a kitchen in a dining room, all reduced to mere lines and shapes by the unforgiving eye of my mind. Thoughts danced like spiders, weaving and unraveling in the quietude of my thoughts, each one a fleeting visitor, not quite leaving its mark. It was a dance of perception, a ballet of observation, and I was but the spectator, the silent witness to the world laid bare.\n\nBorn with a pencil in hand, I had long yearned to capture the world in lines and color, to wield the tool of creation. The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, a tome of wisdom bestowed upon me by an artist I once knew, had become my guide, a roadmap to the labyrinth of the mind where the pencil meets the canvas. It taught me to frame the world, to reduce the complexity of a scene to its most essential parts, to see the simple shape within the chaos.\n\nIn that moment, the bowl of fruit, the kitchen, the dining room, they were more than just a scene; they were a canvas, a landscape waiting for the brush of my perception. I was a painter, a sculptor, a creator, and before me lay the first brushstroke, the first line in my story, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched the handle of my chosen implement, a toilet brush, and the world shifted. The smooth water, the swirling vortex, it all became a canvas, a stage for the dance of my hand. I was the puppeteer, and the brush was my marionette, jerking and spasming, dancing in the rhythm of my will. The offending brown package, a testament to the folly of humanity, refused to yield, entrenched as a slug in the depths of the bowl.\n\nThe mop, a loose grip, a stance wide and steady, the green tie knotted against the collar of my shirt, all bore witness to my struggle. The rude bundle of processed matter, a message left for those who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid, was more than just a nuisance. It was a challenge, a test of my resolve, a reminder of the world's imperfections.\n\nMy hand moved, a slow descent, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey, a delicate dance with the abyss. And in that moment, I was not just a cleaner; I was an artist, a creator, a scribe of the world's imperfections.",
            "In the grim crucible of youth, young souls are claimed by the steel and asphalt, their lives snuffed out in the blink of an eye. The National Institutes of Health, in their unyielding pursuit of truth, have illuminated one aspect of this grim dance with death: the teen brain, in its formative state, is not yet equipped to navigate the perils of the open road. This naivety, this innocence, is as much a curse as it is a blessing. It is inexperience that lies at the heart of this calamity, a blindfolded child stumbling into a world of steel and speed.\n\nThe company of peers, a poisoned chalice, amplifies their folly. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has charted a grim correlation: more passengers, more accidents. California and other states have responded with provisional licenses, a Band-Aid on a bleeding wound. But these measures are but a temporary salve, for the truth is stark and unyielding: the youngest drivers, in their entirety, are not yet ready to bear the weight of responsibility.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman, in his cold, clinical gaze, has peered into the abyss and seen a desire for risk that burns bright and fierce. The thrill-seekers, they are called, these children of the digital age, and they are a plague upon the highways. It is wisdom, not folly, that would delay their descent into the crucible of the open road until the fever of youth has begun to subside.\n\nBy 2010, the children of the Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, a fresh wave of inexperienced drivers ready to plunge into the maelstrom. Legislation, it is whispered, could stem this tide. Driver's education in schools, the first steps on the path to wisdom, but no young soul under the age of eighteen should wield the keys to a motor vehicle. A provisional permit, a trial by fire, and a certain number of hours behind the wheel, the number determined by the majority of states. A uniform law, a beacon in the storm, guiding these young souls safely through the perils of the open road.\n\nThis is not a new idea, a fresh dawn. It is a truth whispered in the shadows, a truth that will not be denied.",
            "In perusing the Library of Congress's archive of Edison's earliest cinematic works, I encountered a clutch of fifteen trick films, dating from 1895 to 1901. These films, like their kin from that era, played with the eye's perceptions, employing creative editing to weave illusions. My study, much like a man unearthing ancient secrets, delved into the poetics of these deceptions, with an eye towards the peculiarities that bloomed in the latter years. The trick films of that time, much like the theatre they mimicked, were rooted in the stationary proscenium, with no camera movement, and adhered to the dictum that one shot equaled one film. Yet, there were renegades among them, daring to spurn these rules, introducing the notion of multiple shots.\n\nOne commonality that seeped through these films was their preference for interior sets, framed within a rigid proscenium. The camera, steadfast and unmoving, bore witness to the action that unfolded within its gaze. This, much like the theatre and vaudeville acts that preceded it, dictated the movement of actors, confining them to a horizontal axis. Consider, for instance, the dance of the actors in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). They entered from the right, moved back and forth, and exited, all without the camera's intervention.\n\nThe proscenium style also dictated that shots be long and, less frequently, medium. Close-ups were an anomaly, a stranger in that world. This, too, was a nod to the theatre, where the audience took in the entire performance at once, framed by the borders of the stage. The actors, much like the characters in these films, did not stray from the middle ground, never moving towards or away from the camera's cold eye.\n\nThe films, much like the theatre, often followed the rule that one conceptual shot equaled one film, limiting their duration to a minute or less. This also restricted their dramatic or narrative capabilities, most focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks. Yet, in these films, what the viewer saw as one shot was often a collage of several, the physical shots joined to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. In \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look reveals where the physical shot of Mary's \"head\" begins, though the entire film is perceived as one shot.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and steadfast advocate for the Republican cause. Born an agriculturalist, his life and brief foray into politics forged a man of unwavering dedication and outspoken convictions concerning personal liberties and governance. His deep-rooted belief in an agrarian system underpinned his views on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the young United States as an unparalleled opportunity to craft an ideal society, unencumbered by native traditions that might hinder progress. He revered the natural rights of men, asserting that they were interdependent, and that denying any one would diminish the value of the rest. These rights, he posited, should be beyond the government's grasp. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a harsh realm where the strong and cunning prospered, but civilized society must not replicate this brutality.\n\nTo achieve this utopia, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge and account for man's inherent good and evil. He held fast to a dualistic morality, claiming, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, he posited, protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government rooted in such principles would function equitably, regardless of administrative avarice and self-interest. While recognizing self-interest as man's primary motivation, he deemed it evil only when it subverted the creation of a society based on the public good.\n\nTaylor, like many of his time, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He yearned for a limited Federal government, with no powers beyond those explicitly stated. He understood that an expansive Federal government could become despotic. Yet, he cautioned against a simple, literal interpretation, as it could easily become corrupt without reference to the writers' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, for it more plainly described the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In reviewing Fig. 17, an abrupt decline in commuter log submissions became apparent in the third month of our project. This sudden drop was a discouraging sight, its cause shrouded in mystery. As winter descended upon our New England campus, fewer took to the roads on bicycle or foot, a natural explanation for some of the fall-off. December, too, brought the end of the fall semester - a time when students and faculty alike were engrossed in frantic preparations for the holidays and the processing of grades. Amidst this turmoil, the commuter log may have slipped from their minds. The holiday season, with its extended break, further diminished the need for campus attendance. Classes resumed in late January, perhaps accounting for the low February submissions. Yet none of this fully explains the February slump. It could be surmised that the project's initial fervor had waned, as such initiatives often do.\n\nTo combat this waning enthusiasm, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special blitz aimed at reinvigorating the project. This indeed resulted in an uptick in log submissions. The challenge, however, lay not only in maintaining the project's momentum but also in counteracting the inertia of holiday and semester breaks.\n\nAnother obstacle faced was the inherent allure of driving one's car, deeply ingrained in our culture. To encourage alternative commuting modes, we offered prizes - gift certificates to local eateries, an independent bookstore, and even national chain stores. The idea of larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, was intriguing but untested. If prizes had been increased gradually, say announcing bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, participation might have risen rather than dipped.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a form of security that tracks an index, commodity, or basket of assets much like an index fund, yet it trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification of an index fund coupled with the singular ownership benefits of a stock, such as short selling, margin buying, and the purchase of as little as one share. While these advantages are appealing, they come with a trade-off—ETFs typically charge a commission for each trade, akin to stock orders. Moreover, ETFs boast a wide array of funds, but a discerning investor should evaluate whether these stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent.\n\nFor our examination, we'll focus on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IHF) and compare it to its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of its total assets. Below are the top 10 holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, normalized to 100%. The results are as follows:\n\nFrom these calculations, it is evident that a portfolio composed solely of the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 points lower than the ETF's overall Beta. Thus, it appears that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns with a lower Beta. However, statistical significance between these two portfolios remains to be established.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios differ statistically, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the annals of Edgar Allan Poe's verse, \"Dream-Land\" stands as one of his most haunting compositions. Within its pages, he employs the term \"Thulé,\" echoing a reference from Virgil, who used it to denote an island beyond the known world, north of Britain. Yet, there exists a more contemporary source that must be acknowledged. Poe, it is known, was deeply engrossed in the works of German authors.\n\nThis connection is of great significance, for it reveals Poe's familiarity with the writings of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his meticulous examination of Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" draws a compelling parallel between the two poets' works, concluding that Poe was, indeed, drawing inspiration from Goethe's pen.\n\nGoethe, a luminary in the realm of literary endeavor, penned the tragic verse drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, the first in 1808, and the second in 1832, the year of his passing. Within this latter section lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of a king who, grief-stricken by the death of his queen, succumbs to despair and ultimately meets his end. The parallels between this king and the speaker of Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, as if Poe himself had stepped into the shadow of Goethe's own words.\n\nPoe's use of Thulé is not confined to \"Dream-Land\" alone. He references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and employs the term twice more as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" These two poems can be viewed as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" acting as a vivid exploration of the themes and imagery present in Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" The landscape of Thulé, as described by the speaker, is one of darkness, loneliness, and haunting memories of lost friends, a realm devoid of color and life. This description mirrors the despair and desolation felt by the King of Thulé, who, much like the speaker, is haunted by the memory of his deceased queen and the loss of his will to live.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe is undeniable, and it is likely that Poe, a man of deep literary admiration, would have been exposed to Goethe's works through the many reproductions circulating at the time. His respect for Tennyson, too, would have led him to explore the works of this celebrated German author.",
            "In the vast expanse of California's legal landscape, the question stands as to whether a patron, after succumbing to the treacherous embrace of an applesauce spill in the belly of D&D's groceries, might find solace in the cold, unyielding justice of punitive damages, given the derelict nature of the store's manager. To walk the plank of this legal inquiry, one must first navigate the treacherous waters of malice, a concept that stirs the souls of judges and lawyers alike.\n\nA judge, wise in the ways of the law, would not lightly dismiss such a claim. To prove that punitive damages are justified, a plaintiff must lay bare the defendant's actions, demonstrating a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would befall others. Jennifer Palmer, our plaintiff, will argue that the defendant, Paul Martin, should have known the peril of his inaction, given the silent sentinels of previous slips and falls that had befallen D&D's patrons. Despite this, Martin stood resolute, his dinner break a testament to his indifference.\n\nOn the thirteenth of October, at the hour of five, an employee named Rich Wayne reported an applesauce spill to Martin, his words echoing in the void of managerial apathy. Martin, consumed by his own appetites, dismissed the matter with a wave of his hand, leaving the spill to fester like an open wound. Mary J. Haddigan, another employee, did her duty and notified Martin again, but the manager's heart remained unmoved. At the stroke of half-past five, the stage was set for disaster as Jennifer Palmer, our unfortunate patron, slipped and fell, her back a casualty of the ignored peril.\n\nThe echoes of these incidents do not stand alone. Five such incidents had already stained the pages of D&D's accident reports in the year that had passed. Yet, Martin, a man of apparent malice, stood by, his conduct a testament to a willful disregard for the safety of his patrons. The law, in its infinite wisdom, has decreed that such conduct, committed with a despicable disregard for the rights and safety of others, is indeed malice.\n\nCalifornia's legal tapestry weaves a thread of malice into its fabric, defining it as conduct that intends harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. Courts have characterized such conduct as malicious when the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his actions, yet willfully and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences. It is in this light that we must examine the actions of Paul Martin, and the fate that awaits the punitive damage claim of Jennifer Palmer.",
            "Four years past, I encountered a course on the faith of Islam, taught at CBC. The class was a crucible of debate, the chief contention being whether Islam harbors hostility. The pertinence of this inquiry, I now believe, has never been more acute. Since the day of infamy, the mass media's perspective has oscillated wildly, from a hostile view of Islam and its extremists to a state of near-tolerance, a shift that, in 2001, seemed unimaginable. A president like Barack Obama, with a Muslim heritage, would have been inconceivable then.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography piqued my interest. The narrative of Muhammad, as presented, seems at odds with the historical record. The Muhammad I've encountered is a figure of force, compelling tribes to adopt Islam through conquest. Yet, the biography paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and meek. It is this disparity that troubles me. The stories of his 'miracles' share uncanny echoes with those of Jesus. The tale of the multiplying mutton and milk echoes the loaves and fishes. This stylistic choice, I find, serves to diminish the miracle of Jesus, as if the life of Muhammad is a pale imitation.\n\nMoreover, the stories in the biography, while claiming to offer witness, often come from third-party accounts. The narrative of hearsay, of 'so-and-so heard from so-and-so,' diminishes the credibility of the tales, casting doubt on their veracity.\n\nWhat disquiets me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad, to cast him as a godly man, humble and wise. Yet, history tells a different tale. If today's Muslims were to learn the truth of Muhammad's rise, I wonder how it would inform their faith.",
            "The teachings of the man they call Jesus, and the beliefs he held in his mortal days, were swiftly abandoned as Christianity took root upon the earth. The history of this faith, if viewed with a broad, sweeping gaze, reveals a ceaseless drift from its origins. The present world, it seems, is marked by an ever-increasing consciousness and a unprecedentedly progressive spirit. Though traditionalists persist, their influence may yet prove insufficient to sway the whole. Among those who claim the name of Christ, a deepening understanding of history will spread, a yearning to distinguish the doctrines added over time from the true intent of their founder. This reversal is as inevitable as the setting of the sun, a process that will strip away the layers of belief, one by one, like the hands of time ticking backwards, until only the essence of what Jesus brought to the world remains. When this tide of change sweeps across the United States and Europe, it will carry with it a multitude, leading them to worship as if they themselves walked in the time of Jesus, guided by his words alone. The church, in its institutional might, will stand strong, yet the theological clock will have turned back, and the profusion of diversity within Christendom will give way to a uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, between sects, between every division, differences will fade away, revealing a singular truth. Human history is rife with such reversals. Once reviled and persecuted, Christianity became the state religion of Rome. The tables have turned since the dark days of African-American slavery, and the tables will turn again in the arena of the Christian faith, seeking the source and undoing the diversity in its wake. But this process will be made possible by a new way of reading Jesus' words, not as literal edicts, but as metaphorical parables. What, then, has transpired since the days of Jesus?\n\nIf we delve far enough into the annals of history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of the Christian faith. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at its core, by the time Rome had seized Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not united in spirit. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "In the grim heart of man, there lies a dark current, an insatiable hunger for gain and power, a selfishness that knows no bounds. This is the truth Upton Sinclair laid bare in his grim tale, \"The Jungle.\" The factory owners and managers, those men with eyes like coal and hearts as cold as the river's flow, saw only their own ambition, their own empire to forge. They cared not for the smoke that choked the lungs of children nor the stench of animal waste that fouled the earth. The very air was rent with the ceaseless din of their industry, a symphony of greed and neglect.\n\nThese leviathans of progress cared not for the men who toiled in their service. \"From the top to the bottom, it was a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair wrote. The men were but cogs in a beastly machine, their lives had no value save in their ability to produce wealth. They were forced to labor in brutal conditions, their bodies and spirits broken by the relentless pace. A sudden layoff, a gleam in the eye of a manager, and multitudes were cast aside like so much refuse. There were no laws to shield these poor souls, no organizations to champion their cause. The unions, they were little more than wolves in sheep's clothing, fleecing the flock they were meant to protect.\n\nThese men, these slaves of the machine, were trapped in a system as unforgiving as the wilderness, as harsh as the winter's frost. They were expected to endure the hell of Packingtown, to accept their fate as a matter of course. There was no escape, no respite, only the endless cycle of toil and despair. Sinclair's words echo with the pitiful cry of a people crushed under the heel of progress: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation, dependent for their opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "In the vast expanse of narrative waters, authors chart diverse courses to evoke sentiments and attitudes toward pivotal subjects. Fitzgerald, with his pen, navigates these waters deftly in \"The Great Gatsby.\" His techniques, both subtle and profound, weave a tapestry that enthralls the reader.\n\nHe pairs nouns and adjectives in ways that dance on the edge of convention, conferring upon the reader a sense of the ethereal. Symbols, too, are his tools, imbued with meaning and wielded to evoke emotions. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald bathes his narrative in hues, each one a whisper of significance: gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.\n\nWhite and gray, his steadfast companions, carry the weight of uniformity. White, a beacon of elegance and refinement, and gray, a whisper of decay and age. Fitzgerald introduces these hues in the novel's opening, a symphony of white: Daisy and Jordan, constant in their pristine attire, and Nick, donning \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party. Even the uninvited Tom wears a \"white shirt\" in his tryst with Myrtle. The city itself is a canvas, with Nick descending into \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" of partygoers etched on his mind. Even the mundane is infused with these hues: Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood,\" the \"gray land\" of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child, and the \"gray old man\" of the dog-seller.\n\nAfter having woven a tale of significance around these hues, Fitzgerald applies them to Daisy, the elusive object of Gatsby's longing. When she emerges in her \"little white roadster,\" she becomes a fixture, a uniform addition to the tapestry of the story. The \"gray haze\" of her fur collar, and her \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter, serve to diminish her character, reducing her to a symbol of Gatsby's desire.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is a masterful dance, a ballet of emotions and significations. He turns the mundane into the profound, the ordinary into the extraordinary, all through the delicate art of imbuing color with meaning.",
            "In the sun-scorched lands of San Diego County, the earth yields bountifully, fed by a benevolent climate that caresses the land in warm embrace. Tomatoes, lemons, and other fruits of the earth swell and ripen under the golden sun, while the earth is nurtured by the hands of those who till her soil. The soil, rich and unspoiled, bears witness to the toil of farmers who tend to it with care, for it is the lifeblood of their existence. This is a land where the line between nature and the human spirit blurs, where the organic certification is a badge of honor, a testament to the respect for the land and its inhabitants.\n\nThe market for such pure, unadulterated produce is robust, with a hunger for the untouched taste of nature's bounty. The demand for organic eggs and milk is insatiable, their consumers craving the simplicity of true sustenance. The landowner, a visionary, sees the potential in this untapped market, a niche where the scales of nature and commerce intersect. Yet, the path to this promised land is fraught with challenges, for the organic farm demands more from its keeper than the conventional fields. It requires a constant vigilance, a ceaseless battle against pest and weed, a delicate dance with the soil to nurture its life and yield its fruits.\n\nThe land in question lies in the shadow of the grand Cleveland National Forest, a parcel of 160 acres that bears the marks of the past. It is a landscape that has known the touch of the Native American hand and the boot of the cattle rancher, a testament to the enduring spirit of the land. It stands in the heart of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, a sanctuary home to a hundred species, many of them endangered, their existence teetering on the precipice of oblivion.\n\nThe ecoregion's conservation plan is still being debated, but the fate of these creatures hangs in the balance. The Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher all call this land home, their survival intertwined with the health of the land. The landowner, a beacon of hope, seeks to be both a conserver and a creator, a guardian of the past and a visionary of the future. He seeks guidance, a path to balance the scales of profit and preservation, a way to turn the tide for the creatures that call this land home.",
            "Culture, an elusive beast, is both what it is and what it is not. It is not a static thing, nor is it singular. It is a tapestry woven with threads of history, prejudice, and personal experience. To presume that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are accommodating is to oversimplify the complex dance of culture. A negotiator would do well to understand the spirit of a culture, its rhythm, and how it will shape the parley.\n\nWhen one steps into the arena of a foreign culture, one does not see only what is present, but also what is absent. One must accept, without judgment, the culture's quirks and idiosyncrasies, for these are the bones of its meaning. Respect for tradition and belief, even in the heart of a stranger's land, can ease the negotiation's passage.\n\nCulture does not confine itself to national borders. Within each nation, companies carve out their own worlds, with unique languages, customs, and beliefs. It is in the dress codes, the manner of speech, the way duties are delegated, and the charities they endorse that one can glimpse a company's culture. Even within the vast expanse of the American corporate landscape, there is diversity, from the relentless to the laissez-faire, from the urban to the suburban.\n\nValues, the heart of a culture, provide its purpose. If face or harmony are valued, a negotiator will not dishonor them. Likewise, if a hard bargain is prized, the urge to settle will be tempered. Before the negotiation, it is wise to understand these values. Yet, to know one's opponent on a personal level can bring a subtle, yet powerful, edge to the parley.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" Thus begins Psalm 14, and so does St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. This sentiment is echoed by another thinker we shall discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Both, so it seems, believe in the same deity, the God of the Bible. To fairly weigh their arguments, we must start with the presumption that both are correct in their belief.\n\nTo sway from this path would be to lose the essence of their arguments, for they each defend a singular God. However, both arguments, despite their merits, fail to provide a comprehensive basis for belief.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument, in its bare bones, posits that God's existence can be found within our own understanding. He suggests that we need not venture beyond our souls to find evidence of Him, but rather to look within. This idea, though convoluted in its articulation, implies that God's existence is self-evident within our own minds. This notion is akin to the Christian concept of faith, wherein acceptance is required in the absence of irrefutable evidence.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach, one might argue, is advantageous for evangelism, as it allows for the recruitment of converts based on logic alone. He presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially posits that the necessity of God can be logically deduced from the world around us.",
            "In the shadows of a distant era, circa the fifth or sixth century before the Common Era, a prince was born, who would one day be known as the Buddha. Over the expanse of his life, he turned his back on the world, attaining enlightenment, and his teachings birthed Buddhism, the most steadfast branch of which is Theravada Buddhism. This religion, now some twenty-five hundred years old, bears little resemblance to its origins, as evidenced by the annual water-cutting ceremony in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka. Monks and laymen alike partake in this ritual, though the Buddha himself never spoke of such festivities. These deviations stretch from superficial traditions to the very heart of the religion's soteriological core. The Theravada Buddhist community, from the cloister to the hearth, has had to alter its doctrinal tenets over the centuries, driven by forces both internal and external, hostile and benign.\n\nTo navigate this discussion, we must understand several qualifying terms. Internal forces are those born within the fold of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their status. External forces originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or damage the Buddhist community, driven by a malicious perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, while not necessarily seeking to help or hinder, may inadvertently do so.\n\nFirst, let us delve into the essentials of the religion—the doctrines that form the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the essence of doctrine, is composed of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka comprises the metaphysical components. These include Anatta, the absence of a fixed soul; Dukkha, the inherent suffering of life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Recognizing these concepts allows one to break free of Sansara, the cycle of birth and rebirth, and thereby end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, and achieve enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, five for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not indulge in intoxicating substances), and many more for monks. The most fundamental doctrinal notion is the four noble truths: First, the truth of suffering, Dukkha; second, the truth that attachment causes suffering; third, the truth that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico, once bound in a protracted rivalry that spanned fifty-seven years, from 1836 to 1893, bear witness to a feud that has echoed through history. The zenith of this enmity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States, with a swift and decisive blow, vanquished Mexico and laid claim to Texas and the American Southwest, new fields for the hungry nation. The tension did not dissipate with this single conflict; it simmered, a boil beneath the surface, until the Great War put an end to it (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The root of this animosity was as much about material interests as it was about differing beliefs, a clash of cultures and traditions, a rift between the Protestant and the Catholic (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis is not an anomaly, but a common tale told among nations that share a border, their interests intertwined in a dance of power and aspiration. The United States and Mexico are but two among many pairs of neighboring nations, bound by proximity and adversity. David M. Pletcher (1977) posits, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, these two nations, geographically close to the United States, have been entangled in a web of rivalry, while others in Latin America have enjoyed a more amicable relationship.\n\nReligious differences, a familiar foe to many a nation, have strained the bond between the United States and Mexico. Sally Frahm (2001) asserts, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). The ideological struggle between the United States and Mexico was not merely a contest of political ideologies, but a clash of religious persuasions. This enmity was a relic of the historic distrust between the English and Spanish, a legacy that impeded the establishment of cordial diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States during this fifty-seven-year period. Most of these disputes were territorial in nature, born of raids from Mexican territory into American soil and other frontier problems (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). The border was a frontier, a wild and unpredictable place, where outlaws and bandits operated with impunity, their raids a constant threat until both nations exerted military force to tame the wildlands.\n\nSchmitt (1974) attests that the rivalry began to abate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, a shift that culminated in American ambitions moving from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico, marking the end of an era in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",

            "In the shadowed recesses of existence, where the unseen tendrils of evolution stretch, the question gnaws at the mind: Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there boundaries or shackles that guide the dance of change? D'Arcy Thompson, in his 1917 musings, whispered that even the simplest organic forms eluded the grasp of mathematical language. Yet, in this age, the call of numbers has echoed, beckoning us towards clarity. Our quest delves into the mathematical modeling of Prunum, a mollusk, through the prism of ontogeny and phylogeny. X-rays have laid bare the quantifiable parameters of these shells, which we have fed into CerioShell, a software that mimics the dance of growth. We have sketched hypothetical morphologies, the boundaries of possibility in this stained-glass world of shell. The echoes of our mathematical whispers are harmonizing with the rhythm of experimental and descriptive studies, seeking to understand the macroevolutionary symphony of Prunum.\n\nA shell, a tube that traverses the circular dance of time, its turns or whorls spiraling around an axis, the columella, unyielding and central. The speed of enlargement varies, a continuous line separating each whorl, a suture. The largest whorl, the body whorl, stands sentinel at the end, the spire stretching back to the apex, its opposite end the base, the aperture, the gateway to the world beyond. The aperture, a window into the shell's journey through time and space, its path traced by coordinates, a mathematical ballet of growth.\n\nThis trajectory, once graphed and quantified, allows for parameters to be varied, the skeletogenesis of the mollusk to be remade in the crucible of numbers.",
            "In the realm where the sun scorches the earth and the shadows dance with drought, the specter of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained a sullen and unyielding presence for a decade. The nation, a behemoth of ambition, strides toward the goals set forth by the Millennium Development, yet the pace of progress in the realm of child and maternal health remains a desolate and desolate march. The reasons for this languor are manifold, and they whisper of a need to bolster the very heart of the health system, rather than to bandage the wounds of its surface.\n\nThe birth of a child in Indonesia now sees the hand of a skilled laborer seventy-two percent of the time, a feat that should be lauded. Yet, this tally includes hands that wield no more than the ancient arts of the midwife, a blade that cannot staunch the river of blood that claims so many mothers. The mothers' grievous plight is not confined to their bodies, for the care of their infants is also wanting. The number of children under five who have sought professional care for diarrhea has declined, their cries echoing through empty clinics. The data on postnatal care is as elusive as the rain in a desert, and it whispers of woe.\n\nThe blade of the scalpel, that instrument of rebirth, is wielded but a mere four percent of the time. The chasm of inequity yawns wide, with cities enjoying a c-section rate of seven percent, while the rural jungle sees a rate of but two. The cities of glass and steel, they gleam with the light of health, while the children of the countryside are left in the shadows. The poor, too, are left to wither, their cries for aid unheeded, their purses bare of coin.\n\nIn the labyrinth of solutions, the question that echoes is this: how best to slay the beast of scarcity? Should the nation focus its gaze on the wounds of the body, or should it seek to strengthen the very heart that pumps life's blood? The siren call of programmatic approaches is strong, their promises of swift and certain results a sweet melody. Yet, they are a double-edged blade, for they too often draw resources away from the slender thread of the overall health system. The ghost of HIV/AIDS, a specter of the past, whispers of the family planning sector's withered husk. The dance of duplication and disarray, a shadow play of forms and paperwork, is a price too high to pay.",
            "Victorian novels are typically marked by their meticulous attention to detail and their preoccupation with the aristocracy of the time. Yet, two notable outliers from this tradition are \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" These works diverge with their unusual blend of mystery and the bizarre, qualities uncommon in the period. This blend serves to deepen the characters within each novel, granting insight into their motivations and emotions. In \"Oliver Twist,\" the protagonist experiences a shooting that is revisited in his mind, not as a memory, but as a vivid dream. This repeated vision underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfold, as well as his dire health situation. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit during the shooting reveal his desperation and the constant, tormenting pain that he endures. This scene emphasizes his inability to gain control or even attempt to influence the outcome of his fate, highlighting the growing sense of defeat that seems to be seeping into his psyche, perhaps instilled by Fagin himself. The shooting, therefore, reinforces the notion that Oliver's life is increasingly beyond his control. This sense of fate is further emphasized in the novel's portrayal of time, where \"the day passed off\" not as a usual passage of time, but as a fleeting, dreadful eternity.\n\n“In the midst of his thoughts, a host of bewildering and confusing ideas assailed him. He found himself still walking between Sikes and Crackit, their angry dispute echoing in his mind as if they were arguing right before him. When he turned his attention to himself, he realized he was conversing with them… Suddenly, he started at the report of a firearm; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through these rapid visions, an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain tormented him incessantly.”\n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThe mystery in these novels often emerges through dreamlike sequences, with different content and purposes in each case. In \"Oliver Twist,\" such sequences reveal insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his sources of pain, and his understanding of the world around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in Chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that transpire, as well as the dire straits his health has fallen into, reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbs all his senses, as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he endures his despair once more, removed from the initial shock of pain, as the pain now persists, linked with fear instead of surprise. With Oliver overwhelmed, questions arise about whose will brought about his misfortune, for it certainly was not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is in jeopardy. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.”",
            "Some time ago, I found myself in the role of a tutor at an after-school program, tasked with assisting elementary-aged students in their academic endeavors. Though I was not unskilled in the art of instruction, my abilities were most keenly felt in the realm of English and reading. I was summoned by one of the instructors to aid a young boy named Adrian, who seemed to flounder in the sea of letters. His difficulties were singularly peculiar; some letters he pronounced with ease, while others eluded him entirely. In his case, the boy possessed a silver tongue in English, yet his grasp of the alphabet was as tenuous as the grasp of a child on a rope. It was during this time that I was privileged to meet Adrian's mother, a woman who spoke naught but Spanish. My own command of the language was as yet unrefined, but we managed to carve a path through the linguistic labyrinth before us. It was then that it struck me like a bullet from a gun; Adrian was not illiterate, but his alphabet was as foreign to him as the moon to the earth.\n\nI recount this tale to shed light on the murky waters of language barriers in our schools, particularly in the vast expanse of California. It is a problem that is not always as apparent as we might suspect. A child who speaks English with the fluency of a native-born speaker may still find the act of reading to be as opaque as a foggy night. This is a reality that we must acknowledge and address, for it is a problem that exists. In Adrian's case, the solution was a straightforward one; tutoring in English reading, with a particular focus on the alphabet and its pronunciation. But for the many children who speak English as a second language, the solution is as complex as a labyrinth.\n\nThe dual language system, to my mind, is a commendable endeavor. It is not merely for those whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Children who partake in such programs have been found to excel academically. Yet, there is a specter of fear that hovers over this idea, that it is a waste of resources, that the majority will gain no benefit. This is a fallacy. If we were to implement such programs in our classrooms, all children would stand to benefit. But how do we achieve this? Should we mandate that all teachers possess a mastery of two languages? Certainly not. This would be a burden too great to bear. Yet, I believe there is no reason why we cannot have bilingual aides, tutors, or whatever term one might choose to employ.",
            "From the moment we stand before the vastness of this world, it is whispered to us that there is something greater than ourselves, beyond our grasp. Some are sent to church, others to temple, and a few delve deep within themselves in search of truth. Many accept the faith of their fathers, while others cast it aside as a vain pursuit. Each of us, in our own way, seek to define a part of ourselves through a unique perspective on the divine. We yearn for a light in the dark, a path out of shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him of his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain drumming on the tin roof above, and we smoked our cigarettes in silence. The gutters wept, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. His gaze was one of searching and remembering, his body thinner, clothes loose, hair sparse. I felt alone, afraid, and incapable of speaking of my loss. I hugged him, drew my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall on the June twilight.\n\nMy father slipped away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatment had prolonged his suffering, but at what cost, I could not fathom. I found myself questioning the nature of a God who would allow such cruelty. Yet, in the dark, I offered no prayer. If such a being existed, I thought, He had long ceased listening to me.\n\nI did not wish to witness his passing from this world into another. I could not bear to see the life that had birthed me fade away. I chose to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I curled into a ball in my bed and waited, for three days, for the silence to speak. But it did not.\n\nNo call came.",
            "The Gothic novel, in both essence and nomenclature, is an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt posits in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. It has been both reviled and revered, accused of shallowness, and lauded for its \"terrible sublime\" allure (Burke). The original Gothic novel, Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, synthesized the ancient and modern romance to forge a new literary path. Walpole employed theatrical elements of yore and modern mimicry of nature to present his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre retains echoes of medieval theater, architecture, and traditions, even as the term \"gothic\" was used to describe diverse races, styles, and epochs. It was seen as archaic, unsophisticated in the face of modern societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's personal narrative allowed it to endure, to become both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nA pivotal aspect of Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry—the training of a proper knight—lives on, transmuted in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry resonated with Gothic writers, representing the brave, honorable, competent knight and the perceived lack thereof in contemporary society. Through chivalric imagery, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the Gothic's evolution into the Romantic. Walpole, amidst political turmoil and unjust accusations, may have grown disillusioned with the moral decay of his time. He may have yearned for the supposed goodness and morality of the Gothic age, a sentiment reflected in his characters. Consider Frederic, described as:",
            "Supply chain management, a term coined by the consultant Keith Oliver in '82, is the ceaseless flow of processes that carry goods from the customer's order through the raw materials, supply, production, and ultimately, distribution to the customer's hands. It entails the planning, implementation, and oversight of the chain's activities to meet the customer's demands swiftly and efficiently. Six are the sentinels that stand guard over this intricate dance: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the pillars on which business managers erect their strategies to serve the customer best.\n\nThe first step in this ballet is production. It is the very bedrock upon which the entire edifice rests. It is here that managers must divine the customers' desires, and the market is the oracle from which they seek enlightenment. Once the market's whispers are understood, decisions are made: what to produce, and in what quantities. The location of the production is then determined, weighing volume and quality against the customer's need and satisfaction. The dance of production is a rigorous one, with every step requiring meticulous planning. A single misstep can cost the company dearly in time and coin. I, who have toiled in the halls of Wal-Mart and Target, have seen firsthand the importance of designed processes. Uniforms, shipments, every detail is laid out in a meticulous booklet to ensure smooth operation without the confusion of direction or expectation.\n\nThe second sentinel is supply, a strategic decision that molds the core capabilities of a facility and forges outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager's task is to choose the division that best suits the product's processes. Outsourcing, a choice often made for velocity, offers the promise of quality and flexibility while reducing costs or maintaining them at a low level.",
            "In the shattered remnants of a once-great plain, a sign stands, its dull surface bearing a grim message: Hitler lives. A lone figure, a child of the screen, holds the shabby placard aloft, her eyes reflecting the despair of the forgotten. The shadows of Burmese jungles whisper of a land torn asunder by a grasping fist, a junta's grip that clutches at the throat of a nation. The color of their robes, saffron, is the hue of their revolution, a defiant cry in the face of tyranny. Monks, the guardians of the spirit, took to the streets, their voices echoing the silent prayers of a people long denied their voice. The world watched, unblinking, as the fist of the junta tightened, monasteries burned, and journalists, like the poor Kenji Nagai, fell beneath the heel.\n\nThis is not a tale of distant shores, nor a relic of ages past. It is the dark reflection of a world where authority and power cling like plague, their tentacles reaching into the hearts of men. From the halls of Rome to the streets of Beijing, the cry of the oppressed is a haunting symphony of suffering. The echoes of Tiananmen's square, where the courage of a generation was silenced by the roar of tanks, ring through the generations. In Rwanda, shadows danced with blood as the scourge of genocide stalked the land. And in the camps of the Third Reich, the chill of death blew through the barbed wire, a bitter wind of despair.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in the realm of jazz is not merely due to his longevity, but also his uncanny ability to mold his ensemble into a living, breathing beast, each member a distinct instrument in a symphony of sound. His pianistic touch, though subtle, is the guiding hand that orchestrates the symphony, crafting textures that highlight the unique voices of his band. Ellington's compositions, a tapestry of intricate notes and harmonies, provide a framework for improvisation, where soloists can weave their melodies as freely as a river carves its path.\n\nHis masterful understanding of each player's sound, and how they coalesce into a cohesive whole, has resulted in some of the most revolutionary pieces in jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary pays homage to this genius, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as a testament to his use of the human voice as an instrument, a technique that would become a signature of his style.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" Ellington's use of voice and reeds in a call-and-response dance is a masterclass in orchestration. Six choruses, each a delicate dance of tone and texture, showcase his innovation. The first chorus begins with a smooth, melodic voice, transitioning to a rougher sound, a stark contrast that echoes the piece's blues roots. Muted trumpet and clarinet solos, in the second and third choruses, elaborate on the melody, painting with the colors of blue notes and high register sweeps. The fourth chorus sees the band echoing the first, while the fifth, a climactic chorus, sees the reeds take the lead in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with the voice adopting a \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. The piece concludes with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending, a symphonic finale that underscores Ellington's mastery of tone color.\n\nEllington's skill in tight orchestration and ear for tone is on full display in \"Hot and Bothered\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" recorded a year later. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he combines the muted trumpet of \"Bubber\" Miley and Baby Cox's scat singing, merging vocal elements of the trumpet with instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. In the latter, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduction of the melody is a tour de force, a testament to Ellington's ability to draw out the unique sound of each instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice and tone to add depth and color is a stylistic trait that permeates his work, a constant reminder of his genius.",
            "She'd always felt the absence of something, a void that gnawed at her like a bad tooth. It began when she first crossed into that murky territory of adolescence. Three years hence, at seventeen, it remained, more insistent than ever. She'd thought it was something she could grasp, a thing she could claim as her own. Boys, girls, it mattered not. None had roused her interest, though they'd tried, clumsy and awkward as they were. She'd questioned this strangeness, turned it over in her mind like a stone, but found no answers that satisfied. So she lived, a stranger to her own desires.\n\nHome, usually a sanctuary, was quiet today. Her parents, they moved through life like old cattle, placid and unruffled. They argued seldom, and when they did, it was with her, their spirited daughter. Independence, they called it. She'd given them no peace, and they'd given her none. Yet, they'd made a good life, this calm couple and their storm of a daughter.\n\nThen came that scream, a sudden cry that sliced through the silence. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart pounding against her ribcage. Her mother lay on the floor, gasping, the word \"ow\" repeating like a mantra. She knelt, her hands hovering, unsure. \"Mom...?\" she whispered. Her mother's eyes fluttered open, unfocused. \"Ow... sweet... take... me... to... the... hospital.\" The words were torn from her, like strips of fabric. Her daughter nodded, her hands finding purchase. She lifted her mother, the weight surprising, and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital, a place of antiseptic and shadows, was a foreign world. She navigated its corridors, her mother a silent burden, until they reached the emergency room. A bed was rolled up, and her mother was transferred, her daughter left to stand alone, her heart a drum in her chest.\n\nHer mother had fallen, that was all. A simple accident, a broken thing. But in that moment, under the harsh glare of the hospital lights, it felt like a world had ended.",
            "In the annals of the scholarly endeavor, a study was undertaken to illuminate the correlation between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" and the mitigated risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, as well as the mortality thereof. The diet, hereafter referred to as the Mediterranean variant (Med variant), is a variant of the traditional Mediterranean Diet, characterized by an elevated consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while eschewing potatoes; it also prescribes a preference for monounsaturated fats over saturated fats, a prominent inclusion of fish, and a judicious consumption of animal products and saturated fats, with a moderate allowance for alcohol.\n\nPrevious investigations had established an inverse relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, as well as the superiority of the Mediterranean Diet over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the overweight and obese. However, these studies, with their singular focus, had not delved into the realm of stroke and stroke-related mortality.\n\nThe present study, a retrospective longitudinal examination, followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes, participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a longitudinal cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across eleven states within the United States. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed the Med variant score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than ninety-five percent of the nurses persisted in their participation over the two-decade period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of coronary heart disease, fatal coronary heart disease, and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In instances where such records were not available, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately seventeen percent of all strokes and twenty-four percent of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified.\n\nTo mitigate random variation for each individual and more accurately represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the Med variant score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could obfuscate results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the association between the Med variant score and the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke was assessed, employing separate models for fatal and nonfatal instances of coronary heart disease and stroke.\n\nIt was found that an augmented adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as reflected by a higher Med variant diet score, was correlated with a diminished risk of incident coronary heart disease and stroke in women. Over the course of twenty years, 2391 incident cases of coronary heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined fatal coronary heart disease and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest quintile of the Med variant diet score exhibited a lower risk for both coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the year 2007, a fateful storm swept through the land of the United States, a financial tempest that left the country reeling, its economy laid low. Jobs withered on the vine, the once-proud architecture of the housing market crumbled to dust, and great corporations, pillars of the nation, were brought to their knees, their empires reduced to naught but shattered remnants. The wound remains fresh, the question persists: how did this calamity befall us, and how do we turn back the tide? The roots of this financial crisis lie in the hearts of men, in decisions made with eyes turned inward, not outward. Banks and firms, driven by greed and naivety, extended credit to those unworthy, burdening them with sub-prime loans. The infrastructure of our financial system, immature and insufficient, buckled under the weight.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown in the year of our Lord nineteen ninety-nine, during the reign of the Clinton presidency. The man in the White House, his sights set on another term, chose to loosen the shackles that bound the banks. The banks, freed, ran amok, their greed unchecked. The New York Times, in its wisdom, foretold the doom that would follow. \"Fannie Mae,\" it wrote, \"has been under increasing pressure from the White House and its shareholders to expand mortgage loans to the least fortunate among us.\" The words of the prophet were true. The storm was coming, a storm of ill-advised lending that would lead to the downfall of the nation.\n\nThe financial markets were a labyrinth, a twisting, turning path of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations. The more these instruments intertwined, the more the economy became enmeshed in the housing market. And so, the nation's households and financial markets alike overleaned, exposed to the slightest of breezes. And when the bubble burst, the financial institutions that had bought into this folly were left with naught but the bitter taste of defeat.\n\nIn the end, the top five investment banks stood before the nation, their debts at $4.1 trillion, a figure that accounted for nearly a third of the country's GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers crumbled like a house of cards, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to don the mantle of commercial banks, their wings clipped by the heavy hand of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, the great titans of mortgage debt, stood at $5 trillion, their heads bowed under the weight of government control, brought low by the storm they had helped to unleash.",
            "Ah, the dreaded exposition. That infernal stretch of prose where the author attempts to unfurl his or her wings, only to find them clipped by the relentless tide of information. It's the difference between a soaring eagle and a crashing insect, a symphony and a cacophony. Dr. Merlin, in her wisdom, has uttered oaths at her keyboard when she finds herself ensnared in the morass of Too Much Information, a predicament not so delightful as one might imagine.\n\nExposition, my dear reader, is not your ally. We have all heard the dictum, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin herself has been ensnared in its clutches, entangled in webs of words that lead nowhere or, worse, nowhere fast. Exposition, that insidious whisperer, beckons for us to get the story out of the way, to hurry through the mundane details that, in the grand theater of life, are never so simple.\n\nTake, for instance, the tale of a heroine and her beloved. You might be told they met at a certain place and time, wed in a grand ceremony, and that her husband met his demise before her eyes. You would not expect this tale to be told in a breath, nor would you wish to read two pages of unexceptional prose, during which both parties speak nary a single word. You would expect, nay, demand, that the author paint their portraits in broad and vivid strokes, that you witness the husband's love for his wife through his words and deeds, and that the heroine reveal her thoughts and dreams through the prism of his life.\n\nFor it is not enough to simply know they met, they married, he died. You must feel it, as if you yourself stood there, witnessed their love bloom, wither, and die. You must mourn his loss with her, and in doing so, become entwined in her fate.\n\nYet, it is tempting to rush. To introduce a new character and simply state his past, his present, his dreams. To give him a simple biography rather than a life. Dr. Merlin herself has been tempted, and thus, she implores you, dear writer, to resist the siren call of the simple sentence. To provide the meat, not just the bone.",
            "I sat through two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, as they flickered across my screen. The first, from NBC 4, was live and aired on the thirteenth day of August, 2011. The lead story was of a man, Shad Hostettler, who had slit the throat of his wife in Ashley. The newscaster, his voice a monotone, rattled off the name and the gruesome act, presenting a mugshot that seemed to beckon pure malice. They lingered on him for two minutes, a grim silence hanging heavy in the air, before moving on.\n\nThe second tale was of a youth, Travis Buyers, who had been caught in the crossfire of Sharon Woods. Shot and critically wounded, he lay there, a pawn in a dance of violence. The SWAT team was called, but no arrests made, no suspects named. The story was brief, no more than a whisper, but I've seen this before - a black life snuffed out, a shadow brushed aside.\n\nThe rain and thunderstorms predicted for the weekend were next, a weather forecast that was as dark as the other stories. The temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties, a tepid promise of warmth.\n\nThe final story was of a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, wearing a hoodie, was the culprit. They lingered on his race, his skin's hue, his height and weight. It was an odd disproportion, a focus that seemed to serve no purpose.\n\nThen came the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin convicted of distributing marijuana across the border. Instead of years, the sentence was spoken in months, a harsh, cold number - three hundred. His ethnicity was mentioned, a detail that seemed to cling to the story like a shadow.",
            "There lies an indomitable, unyielding bond between brothers, a bond that runs deeper than the roots of the ancient oak. Within this bond, a labyrinth of emotions unfurls - love, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Brothers comprehend each other in ways that others never can, and in the eyes of their kin, they see not a reflection of their own image, but the truth of their soul laid bare. When the storm of life rages, it is here that the true nature of this bond is revealed, shining through like a beacon in the darkest night. The cost of these emotions, born of blood and bone, must be paid, and paid dearly. To understand the heart of this fraternal tie is to grapple with the consequences it bears. In the brother's gaze, one sees not the world as others see it, but as it truly is, stripped of all pretense. It is in their deeds and the fallout that follows that their true character is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers traverse this theme, and the tumultuous emotions that attend it. Through landscapes teeming with life and vivid imagery, these two boys embark on a journey that is as futile as it is profound. Bitterness and exultation clash in their final, fateful encounter, and only one brother emerges from the ashes. The theme is woven through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which imparts the complex feelings of the protagonist and his view of the world, both of which shape his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be distilled to a single emotion: pride. From their first foray together, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his brother, Doodle. He yearned for a sibling to impart his worldly knowledge upon, to race with to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine's embrace. Yet, Doodle's frail heart and condition made these dreams a mockery. The protagonist, his head filled with wild notions, found these aspirations shattered in an instant. He even considered extinguishing the life that had so dashed his hopes, contemplating to smother Doodle with a pillow. But the small child's smile, that simple act, gave him hope. This shows that his resolve was not unyielding. In the depths of his heart, he harbored an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the silent, ceaseless hum of thought, the human brain, a labyrinth of circuitry and pulsating flesh, labors. As the world has advanced, so too have the metaphors we employ to grasp its workings. From the wax tablet, to the papyrus scroll, to the bound book, we've sought to comprehend this enigmatic organ. Yet, these metaphors bear the weight of their own limitations, like the ghosts of former knowledge haunting the present.\n\nThe brain's journey begins with the harbingers of sense - the eyes, ears, skin, and tongue - transforming the world's raw signals into electrochemical whispers. These whispers are shaped anew by the brain's algorithms, a relentless dance of bottom-up and top-down processing. In the tapestry of perception, the simplest threads of color, shape, and light are woven into a whole, the black box on the white background. The top-down process, like a wind through the trees, quickens the recognition, guiding the eye to see not just a shape, but a black box, and not a hole in the white.\n\nAttention, the gatekeeper, decides what whispers to let through. In the cacophony of life, it filters out the unimportant, the inconsequential, the mere rustling of grass. Yet, like a hound on the scent, it can single out the crucial, the familiar, the name spoken in the din of a room.\n\nTo process, the brain must first store. There are the fleeting, ephemeral memories of sensory experience, the short memory holding space for a fleeting moment, and the vast, enduring store of long-term memory, where information is etched into the structures of proteins, like words carved into stone.\n\nThe brain's knowledge, it's said, is organized in a grand web of associations, nodes of thought linked by the threads of relatedness. In this intricate design, a chair, as if by some unseen hand, is linked to a table, to the grain of wood, to the very essence of these things.",
            "In the grim tale of Aldous Huxley, \"Brave New World,\" the specter of both technological advancement and the capitalist system it engenders looms large, casting a dystopian shadow over the future. The inhabitants of this world value the collective over the individual, their minds conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification as the ultimate pursuit. They are but pawns in a grand game, their fates dictated by the World Controller, who weaves their ideologies as a spider does its web.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist critique, Huxley's reservations about the burgeoning economic order become starkly apparent. Terms such as homogenization and reification echo through the narrative, highlighting the author's disdain for the emerging economic structure of his time. Capitalism is ridiculed through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common folk are blinded to their true relationship to the economic classes, their minds fixated on self-interest and the fleeting pleasures of consumption.\n\nThe common classes, Delta, Gamma and their like, are as much slaves to their conditioning as they are to their station in life. Hypnopædia, the state's system of sleep learning, reinforces this. The World Controller, the puppeteer pulling the strings, manipulates their desires, their wants, their very identities. Hegemony is the tool he wields, subjugating the lower classes to the whims of the upper, who, despite their awareness, do little to resist.\n\nIn this world, individuality is a foreign concept. Characters, even the most prominent, are little more than ciphers, their depths unplumbed. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the union of technology and capitalism strips man of his free will, his self-expression. Love and its extremes are absent, interactions kept shallow and superficial. Men comment on women's physical attributes, and women discuss their encounters with the same dispassion. The complacency of each class in their societal roles is a stark indication of the socioeconomic oppression of capitalism. They obey their place, their role, their lot, in the grand machine, a testament to the Marxist notion of the proletariat, content in their lot so long as they consume, obey, and stay in line.",
            "I've been a student here at University Park for nigh on two and a half years, or the better part of four and a half semesters. Navigation on this campus can be a trialsome endeavor, a fact that has been etched into my bones since my freshman year. I found myself in an East Halls dormitory, the easternmost outpost of our fair campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The journey from my humble abode in Stuart Hall to classes in distant places like the Willard building could take upwards of a quarter of an hour on foot, and that's not even accounting for the weather, which is as unpredictable as a drunkard's path.\n\nAn aging alum, with more miles on his boots than a traveling salesman, told me of a time when the East Halls were isolated by vast, empty tracts of land. Now, that emptiness has given birth to sports fields, a new Creamery, health services, and apartment blocks, encircling the dorms like a fortress. As our campus swells, so does the challenge of traversing its length and breadth.\n\nThe bicycle, that two-wheeled contraption, is the answer, yet it's not the whole solution. It requires a resolve to ride, and a campus that caters to its needs. I spoke to a friend who recently returned to his bicycle after a hiatus. \"Bikes are the only way,\" he mused, \"for a spell it wasn't fashionable, but it's the way to go.\" The bicycle, alongside a bowl of oatmeal, can carry you far, as I've learned in my journey from off-campus lodgings to Thomas building.\n\nEvery morning, the journey from my home to Thomas can be a twenty-five-minute trudge on foot, but with a bike, it's reduced to a mere five minutes, if one pedals with enough spirit. Yet, Pollock Road, the most direct route, is not always an easy path, be it on two feet or two wheels. Walking, too, has its merits, but I'm in a hurry, and time is a precious commodity.\n\nIf I didn't have my bicycle, the walk would be my only recourse, a journey that would claim an additional 30-40 minutes each way, a loss of over two and a half hours per week. Add to that the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so forth. It's a burden I cannot bear."
