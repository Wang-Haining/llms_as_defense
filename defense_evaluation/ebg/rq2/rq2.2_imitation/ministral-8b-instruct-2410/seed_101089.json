            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I am drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I intend to dedicate my life to the healing of children who have suffered abuse or neglect, and to offer support to families teetering on the precipice of ruin. The values that I bring to this endeavor are as follows: unyielding service, respect for the dignity of all, a steadfast commitment to ethical behavior, and an unwavering dedication to the improvement of relationships and my own professional growth. These are not merely professional ideals; they are the very bedrock of my being.\n\nSince my youth, I have been a beacon for those in need, though I was once uncertain of the path that would lead me to my true calling. In the hallowed halls of high school and college, I beheld many a soul retreating from their troubles in a futile dance with denial, and some who adopted coping mechanisms that were as twisted as the shadows they sought to escape. Witnessing such scenes, I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Yet, even with this education, I was no closer to my true calling until that fateful summer, when I visited a friend and encountered a sixteen-year-old boy, trembling on her couch like a fawn in a storm. He had fled his home, seeking refuge from an abusive parent. The next day, I learned that he had called the police. I offered my assistance, and when the law could offer no solace, I sought the parents, hoping to shed light upon the darkness that had befallen their son. But their excuses were as thin as their nerve, their explanations for their actions as hollow as their hearts. That day, I began to see the path that was laid before me: a career in social work, a path that would lead me to the broken and abused, and offer them a beacon of hope in the darkness.\n\nBut beyond the pursuit of my own redemption, I am guided by a deeper call: the pursuit of social justice. Our society claims to hold the individual as sacred, yet we mourn them not for their uniqueness, but for their conformity to the mores of tradition. I am an individual, and I will not bind myself by the chains of societal expectation. From the halls of high school to the quadrilateral of college, I have stood against injustice, coloring my hair in hues that defied convention, dressing in clothing that reflected my true self, piercing my ears to the limit, and declaring my membership in the GSBA, fighting against the scourges of racism and discrimination wherever I found them. I am an advocate for social justice, and I will continue to stand against the tides of injustice that seek to drown us all.",
            "In these pages, we delve into the encroaching specter of insomnia, a blight that plagues both body and mind. We invoke two models to frame our understanding: the biological and the sociocultural. The former plumbs the depths of inherited traits and physical malaises, while the latter charts the tumultuous waters of environment and societal circumstances.\n\nInsomnia, a bugbear of the night, manifests in myriad forms. It is a primary disorder, a scourge of another mental affliction, or a by-product of medical ills or substance abuse. Dyssomnias, the primary disorders, include insomnia and hypersomnia, while parasomnias—behavioral or physiological anomalies—range from nightmare disorders to sleepwalking.\n\nOur focus is on insomnia, a shadow that hovers over consciousness, robbing it of rest. The biological model, a labyrinth of genes and physiology, reveals that neurons in the hypothalamus, bearing the orexin neuropeptide, govern slumber and wakefulness. Research with mice, those tiny sentinels of the night, uncovers that GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are the sentinels of sleep and wakefulness. Activated, they promote sleep; inhibited, they induce wakefulness. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep in mice, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for this receptor in humans. However, a flaw or absence thereof could render one a slave to sleeplessness, a curse that seeps into every aspect of life, from school to work, from focus to monotony.\n\nThe sociocultural model, meanwhile, examines the shackles of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. It posits that the very environment in which we are born and live can dictate our sleep patterns. A phenotype inherited from generations past could regulate our sleep, while an alteration in this receptor could disrupt it, casting a pall over our lives.\n\nBut remember, these are but models, frameworks to understand the labyrinthine nature of sleep. They illuminate aspects, but they do not dispel the darkness entirely. The journey into insomnia's heart is long and fraught with uncertainty. Yet, we must press on, for understanding lies not in the end, but in the path itself.",
            "The labyrinthine disorder known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or its less cumbersome sibling Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is the inefficiency and ineffectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes what we hear. Defined in its most stark terms, (C)AP is the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underpins this processing, culminating in those peculiar electrophysiologic auditory potentials. It is a condition in which the brain, that most enigmatic organ, fails to translate sound into meaningful perception. The afflicted may hear as clear as any, yet the brain's intricate machinery, that which separates the wheat from the chaff, the honey from the beeswax, malfunctions as if possessed by some spectral interference.\n\nThe origins of this disorder trace back to the mid-20th century, when researchers began to scour the minds of children with communicative impediments. In 1954, an Italian trio of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began crafting tests for these children, while in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception. A conference in 1977 served as a catalyst for further inquiry into this disorder, though its causes and a definitive diagnostic tool remain elusive.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are myriad, like the shadows cast by a full moon. The sufferer may be unable to pinpoint sound in space, to differentiate between simultaneous acoustic events, to recognize patterns, to detect changes in speech, or to sequence auditory information. The eerie silence of the afflicted is a stark contrast to the cacophony of the world around them.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD is a complex dance, requiring a systematic examination of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists employ various measures, including questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, and even recording acoustic signals within the ear. Yet, no single tool or test has emerged as a panacea, and the disorder's cause remains a mystery.",

Yet, the unmasking of such deceit presents its own perils, for one may find themselves cast adrift from those whom they hold dear. The question then becomes, is it better to preserve one's own identity at the cost of these relationships, or to discard the guise of falsehood and risk the wrath of those who have been deceived?\n\nIn the matter of gender role reversal, deception becomes a fraught issue, for it begs the question: Why does one feel compelled to shed their own skin and adopt the guise of another? In Viola's case, her motivation is clear: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). Having found herself in a foreign land, she feels the need to masquerade as a man to protect herself from the predations of men. Her plan bears fruit, yet it also isolates her from her fellow women, severing her from a vital support network. Her deception runs deeper still, as Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian, and finds herself besotted with Cesario.\n\nHer own romantic entanglements further complicate matters, as she grapples with suppressed desires for both her employer, Orsino, and Olivia. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261) It is through this web of deception that hidden emotions are brought to light, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. One might argue that these characters, through their interactions with Viola/Cesario, are forced to confront and acknowledge their subconscious desires.\n\nConsider Olivia's treatment of Cesario, who she first loves as a man, then as a sister, and finally as a beloved friend. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) It is as if Shakespeare, in his cleverness, is illustrating how deception can unveil the subconscious, much to the detriment of those involved. Perhaps Olivia's feelings for Cesario/Viola are not merely a result of Cesario's appearance, but a reflection of her own hidden desires.\n\nYet, one must not forget that Olivia's behavior is also a commentary on the mores of Shakepeare's time, where appearances held great sway. Her fickleness is a testament to this, as she switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, not out of malice, but out of a societal expectation to love and be loved based on appearance.",
            "The German colonial reign is oft noted for its harshness, particularly in its carnage of the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. Yet such a generalization pales in the face of the varied policies and governance that permeated their empire. The educational landscape, much like the geography, was a tapestry of differing hues. When the British assumed control of German East Africa, a literate populace awaited them. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational endeavors were praised by contemporary chroniclers. However, South West Africa (now Namibia) bore a stark dissimilarity.\n\nThe government, unlike in East Africa where it actively participated in education, deferred to missionary societies, providing them with meager sustenance. The European population, however, benefited from a robust system of state schools, nurtured and regulated by the colonial power. These policies cast long shadows, even after German rule receded. Unlike other colonies, where literate Africans abounded, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority remained untouched, unenlightened, and illiterate.\"\n\nA myriad of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This exploration seeks to delve into these factors, with a particular focus on the sentiments of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populace.\n\nA plethora of literature exists regarding education within the German colonial realm. Much of this is in German, penned during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works primarily chronicled the educational systems. Later writings, in English, expanded on this discourse through comparative studies and more nuanced analyses. These studies underscored the divergence in educational systems across colonies.\n\nCohen's study of South West Africa and East Africa is a notable exception. He compared the educational systems of the two colonies, attributing many of the distinctions to the large settler population in South West Africa.\n\nGeographically, South West Africa is a land of contrast; it boasts moderate climate, though much of it is barren desert. Its European populace, drawn to its relative comfort, numbered nearly 15,000 by 1913, compared to the scant 5,336 in the next most populous colony, East Africa.",
            "The taxonomy of Popular Music hath grown over the past one hundred years, encompassing a multitude of genres that defy exhaustive enumeration. Complicating matters further, most, if not all, genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, et al.—have spawned a veritable labyrinth of sub- and sub-sub-genres within their domains. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock, in particular, hath become a bastion of diversity and expression within the past four decades. It doth convey a broad spectrum of emotions, verging predominantly towards the darker recesses of the soul.\n\nThe origins of this genre, like a river carving its path through the earth, trace their lineage back to the psychedelic drug boom of the mid-seventies. This was an era where the boundaries between reality and the surreal were blurred, and the music that emerged reflected this state. The music of this time was wild, untamed, and otherworldly, driven by the scapegoat of drugs. The Romantic Era too cast its shadow upon later generations of metalheads, its dark, visceral qualities seeping into their songs like poison into the bloodstream.\n\nIn the realm of Heavy Metal, one need not look far to find lyrics that embody this darkness. Consider the following from Helter Skelter by the Beatles:\n\n\"When I take a trip on a rocket ship,\nIt's bound for a planet that's not the same as this one,\nIt's a place where the children cries and the food is all gone,\nBut when I'm there they call me a star.\"\n\nThis song, the dark and raucous response to a similarly heavy Rolling Stones tune, marks the debut of a new breed of music. The Beatles, spurred by the challenge of the Stones' heavier sound, sought to prove their mettle with this track, and in doing so, they birthed a movement—a dark and expressive force that would go on to spawn countless variations and sub-genres, a testament to the power of darkness and the human spirit.",
            "In the mists of time, long before the Surrealists' dreams were given form on canvas, there lived an artist who did much the same, albeit in his own peculiar fashion. Henri Rousseau, the man who would later be known as Le Douanier, spent his days crafting dreams—his own, and those of the world he sought to depict. The Dream, a piece from the annals of 1910, is not merely a vision of a woman entranced by a dreamt landscape, but also a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations and internal struggle.\n\nBorn on a May evening in Laval, a town in the northwest of France, Rousseau lived a life that echoed the rhythm of the seasons. His father was a man of humble means, a tinsmith and dealer in hardware, yet he was not without comfort. Young Henri, however, was not destined for the gilded halls of the art academies. Instead, he was groomed for the life of a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, a life he would lead until the age of forty. Yet, life, it seems, had other plans for Henri. A series of tragedies—first the death of his wife, then the loss of their eight children, and finally the birth of his only surviving child, Julia—left Rousseau yearning for solace in a new world. The brush, it seemed, was to be his salvation.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance, for recognition, is a tale as old as time itself, yet his path was uniquely his own. He was not educated in the ways of the masters, nor did he begin his artistic journey at the usual tender age. Instead, he painted as one who had much to say, yet little to say it with. His dream was to be accepted, to be recognised, to be seen not as the douanier, but as Henri Rousseau, the artist. Yet, to do so, he faced a dilemma that would haunt him throughout his career—a choice between the familiar path of mimicry and the path less traveled of authenticity.\n\nThe Dream, then, is not just a painting of a woman dreaming. It is a testament to Rousseau's struggle, a landscape of his own internal battle. Should he conform to the styles of his contemporaries, to the tastes of the critical world he so admired? Or should he forge his own path, allowing his unique vision to guide him? The choice was his to make, and make it he did, painting not for praise, but for the sake of his art.",
            "In the shadowed corners of thought, many a sage has whispered the intimate tangling of ethics and beauty, of truth and art. It is not for me to unravel this mystery, but rather to acknowledge it, to let it breathe in the quiet spaces between words. As Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our learning comes through instruction or trial, yet we seem drawn to the unspoken, the ineffable.\n\nEthics and aesthetics, they are both as much about describing as they are about prescribing. Our studies of morality and beauty, they are like the cartographer's map, showing us the paths but not the land itself. A conversation on the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might delve into perspective, hue, or cultural tapestry, yet these are but stepping stones on the river's bank. Often, we are left with a haunting echo, a \"just something about it\" that defies full capture.\n\nLiterature, it is like a whisper in the dark, a story that cannot be told but only experienced. As O'Connor mused, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" So too, ethics, it is a dance with the unknown, a song sung in the wind. It is this je ne sais quoi, this transcendental essence, that makes art and morality powerful, and binds them in a shared mystery.\n\nWe experience both morality and art at a level that is felt, but not fully known. This noumenal realm, it is where the heart beats, and the soul takes flight. Literature, it is the most intimate of the arts, for it speaks to our values, our truths. As McKean observed, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The Deutschland of today stands as a bastion of unity, a nation rooted in the looming shadows of the Alps in München, stretching to the Baltic coast of Kiel. The same indelible spirit echoes from the river Rhine's banks in Köln, through the heart of the country, and to the Elbe's embrace in Dresden. Such a vibrant culture, born of divergent sources and tribes, should not be surprising.\n\nGermania, the ancestral domain of the Germans, is shrouded in mysteries as deep as the Rhine. The origins of its name are a puzzle even the scholarship of centuries cannot resolve. Tacitus in his 98 AD treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" posits that the name came from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were once called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between his conquests, the Gauls, and the Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine. The word may hail from the Gaulish language, a shout from the battlefield, or the Old Irish \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicative of the Germans' war cries. Tacitus himself wrote that the Germans were \"aboriginal,\" unmingled by foreign blood, having arrived by ship rather than by land, drawn to \"wild country, inclement skies, sullen manners and aspect\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nThe Romans, with their sprawling empire, would dispatch legions to Germania for spoils and tribute, rarely venturing into the heart of the land. The Germanic tribes, however, found their place within the Roman ranks, their goods and skills traded for the might of the empire (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.).",
            "Downwards I gazed, mind unyielding and blank, drinking in the tableau before me. Unfeeling, unyielding, with a practiced detachment that refused to acknowledge the subject as anything more than a puzzle to be solved, my consciousness analyzed the scene laid out before my eyes. Thoughts flickered in and out, like shadows dancing on the walls of a cave, too ephemeral to grasp.\n\nOnce, I was given a book by an artist, a tome titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had yearned to capture the world around me since I was six, and this book promised to teach me the secrets of the mind's eye. It spoke of squares and lines, of how the brain interprets them, and of transforming complex scenes into simple, digestible images. Yet, that morning, as I stood before the bowl of fruit, I could not see the frame. I was overwhelmed, awestruck, as if I were confronted with the raw, unfiltered canvas of the world itself.\n\nPicasso's blues, Monet's greens, the Italian Renaissance's rainbow of colors - they were all paltry imitations of this... this... thing before me. If I were to attempt to call my own perspective \"Artistic,\" then this was the beginning of my masterpiece, the first stroke of my brush, the first page of my story, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nFingertips met the handle of my chosen instrument, muscles tensed and released, my will given shape as I moved. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Matter broke away, lost to the void. A second attempt, more anxious, more urgent, as my hand struck the handle again. The offending package refused to budge, stuck fast like a burr in the throat.\n\nMop in hand, feet planted firmly, tie knotted tight around my neck, I stared at the offending mass, a rude testament to the world's transience. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand reached for the wall, the sheet at the end of the toilet paper wrapping itself around my fingers like a shroud.",
            "In the grim tally of America's youngest drivers, a grim reaper's scythe cuts down more than a few. A confluence of factors weaves this macabre tapestry of youthful carnage. The National Institutes of Health whisper that the teen mind, in its nascent state, is not yet equipped for the perils of the open road. The simple inexperience of youth lies at the heart of this scourge. It is not merely the fatal accidents that plague these tender drivers, but also the heightened risk of rollover, speeding, and the abyssal plunge off the asphalt's edge.\n\nWhen these young souls journey with their peers, the danger is compounded tenfold. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center's sobering study reveals a stark correlation: the age of the passenger and the frequency of vehicular calamity. California and other states, in their wisdom, have enacted temporary provisional licenses, limiting the hours of teen driving and banning other minors as passengers. Yet, like a bandage over a festering wound, these measures are mere stopgaps.\n\nThe true malady lies in the collective ineptitude of the youngest drivers, as evidenced by the grim statistics. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even 18 is too tender an age for a license. A common tendency among those under 19 or 20 to court danger for the mere thrill of sensation only serves to exacerbate the problem. The thrill-seeker will not be weaned from the wheel until the tendency to seek such sensation has abated.\n\nIf we persist in granting driver's licenses to these youthful innocents, the death toll will not cease to rise, but will instead escalate into a grim procession. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' progeny will flood the highways, armed with licenses and a youthful insouciance.\n\nThe cure for this disease is not complex. Schools could continue their driver's education classes, but no teenager under 18 should be allowed to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could precede a full license, and a prescribed number of practical driving hours could still be mandated. The specific number of hours could mirror the majority of states' requirements, such as California's current 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. A uniform, national legislation would be a reasonable and effective means of safeguarding these young lives across the nation.",
            "In the dusty tomes of the Library of Congress, I found myself ensnared by the early Edison films, a collection of fifteen trick films from '85 to '01. These were not mere moving images, but illusions conjured by the alchemy of creative editing. My study of these films was a dance with the poetics that dominated most, and the outlier characteristics that flickered like embers in the later ones.\n\nAt the dawn of the twentieth century, the trick film was a creature of its time and bounds, bound by a frontal proscenium, immobile camera, and a rigid adherence to the one-shot rule. Yet, there were those that dared to defy these shackles, introducing multiple shots like a breath of rebellion.\n\nA common thread amongst these films was their setting: a stage within a frame, a theatre of the imagination. The camera, like a sentinel, stood firm, unmoving, its gaze fixed upon the action. A legacy of the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience's eyes were never meant to wander from the stage. Figures moved side-to-side, like cattle in a pen, never approaching or retreating from the eye of the camera. Witness, if you will, the dance of the actors in 'Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel' (1900), their movements confined to a horizontal plane, the camera their unyielding witness.\n\nThe shots themselves were long and medium, rare were the close-ups. A theatre tradition, where the audience's gaze was meant to embrace the whole tableau, never drawing close to the subject. The actors, like marionettes, remained in the middle distance, their faces never close enough to reveal their secrets.\n\nMost early trick films were constrained by the one-shot rule, their lengths limited to a minute or less. This was a limitation not of technology, but of storytelling. They were vaudeville acts, tricks and illusions, devoid of grand narratives. Yet, a single 'shot' could be a deception, a joining of several frames to create an apparition or a disappearance. Look closely at 'The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots' (1895), and you'll find the moment where Mary's severed 'head' begins, even as the film is, conceptually, one grand shot.",
            "In the desolate expanse of Caroline, John Taylor stood as an early and resolute advocate of Republicanism. Though he was first and foremost a man of the earth, his brief foray into politics and his life's work in agriculture had carved a man of unwavering dedication and unyielding voice in matters of personal liberty and governance. His conviction that the agrarian life was the highest calling shaped his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw in the young nation an opportunity to forge an ideal system, unhindered by native traditions that would cloud the minds of its creators. He believed in the natural rights of man, that they were interdependent and that denying one would diminish all, making them less valuable. These rights, he argued, should be beyond the reach of the government, for in his eyes, the state of nature was a brutal place where only the strong and cunning survived.\n\nTo create this utopia, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge the inherent good and evil within man. He was a rigid dualist, claiming that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, he defined, were those that protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government founded on such principles would function fairly, regardless of its administrators, who were inevitably driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was the root of all motivation, but only became evil when it transcended the creation of a society based on the public good, giving birth to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to harness man's natural evil, but it must be closely watched to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many of his fellow Republicans, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He advocated for a Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the document, for he knew that an extensive one was expensive and thus prone to despotism. However, he cautioned against a simple, literal interpretation, as it could easily become corrupt without reference to the intent of the writers. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, was the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to the chart, a precipitous decline in commuter log submissions occurred in the third month. This was a disheartening sight, and the cause is uncertain. As winter set in, bicycle and foot commuter numbers naturally dwindled, as did the campus population for the busy end-of-semester period. December's holiday bustle and subsequent break could account for some of the drop-off. Classes resumed late January, and the spring semester began, leading to a low February log count. The project's natural ebb and flow is also a factor, with an initial burst of enthusiasm followed by waning interest. To combat this, the Carpool Challenge Week was instituted in March, which saw an uptick in submissions. We faced the challenge of maintaining momentum despite holidays, semester breaks, and the deeply ingrained car culture. To incentivize alternative commuting, we offered gift certificates to local businesses. Larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, could have increased engagement further. The prize structure remained consistent, but increasing their value over time may have yielded better results. Initial gift cards seemed adequate, but announcing bicycles and hybrid/electric cars in December and January could have boosted participation.",
            "In the realm of finance, an ETF, or exchange traded fund, is akin to a creature of the market, forged to mirror an index, commodity, or basket of assets, yet possessing the fluidity of a stock upon the exchange. This beast grants you the breath of an index fund, while offering the singular ownership of a stock - the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and acquire as few as one share in a transaction. Yet, this creature bears a price, for the cost of entry is not merely the sum of its holdings, but the commission of the trade, much like the cost of a stock order. Moreover, the variety of funds available is as diverse as the stars in the night sky.\n\nBut heed, for the allure of these benefits must be tempered with scrutiny. A discerning investor should weigh the benefits against the reality, for the shadow of doubt lies ever in the darkness of the market. In this parable, we shall examine the ETF IHF and compare its top ten holdings, accounting for 63.58% of its assets, to determine if the benefits of holding a single ETF are as bountiful as those of a diversified portfolio of its constituent parts.\n\nTo gauge the efficacy of these holdings, we shall normalize the current percentage of assets to 100% and calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and return, should such a portfolio be composed entirely of these ten stocks in the proportions prescribed by the ETF. The results are recorded in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it is clear that a portfolio of merely the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. Moreover, the Beta of these ten holdings is 12% lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Yet, this disparity may be no more than a mere statistical quirk, a shadow play of the market.\n\nTo ascertain the veracity of this hypothesis, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare it to the accumulated standard deviation of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the realm of Edgar Allan Poe's literary domain, \"Dream-Land\" stands as an oft-claimed paragon of his poetic prowess. Within its mystic verses, Poe deploys the term \"Thulé,\" a relic dating back to Virgil's annals. Virgil, it is known, employed this term in reference to an isle beyond the known world, north of Britain. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, we must also acknowledge a more contemporary influence. Poe, you see, was a man of German literary persuasions.\n\nThis particular quote bears significance, for it bears witness to Poe's familiarity with the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his treatise \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between the two poets, concluding that Poe was not merely influenced, but outright imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe as a luminary in the realm of poetic drama, his magnum opus, \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808, the year of its inception, and the second, the year of Goethe's demise, 1832. Within the latter part, a short poem, \"The King of Thulé,\" is embedded in the verse. This poem recounts the tale of a king whose wife's demise, following the gift of a goblet, drives him to despair, eventually leading to his own end. The parallels between the king's plight and the speaker's journey in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, almost as if Poe channeled the spirit of Goethe's melancholy king.\n\nPoe, it seems, was drawn to this motif, referencing \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and employing the term as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" These two works, \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land,\" can be read as a pair, their themes of melancholy and despair intertwining like the lines of a poem.\n\nIn \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a land of perpetual twilight, haunted by the specters of lost friends, and bereft of color. These scenes, when compared to \"The King of Thule,\" reveal a mirroring of Goethe's own despair, a reflection of his grief and loss. The entire poem reads like a walk into the heart of Goethe's despair.\n\nGoethe, a writer of immense renown, would have been familiar to Poe, not only through his connection to Tennyson, but also through the many translations and reproductions of his works that circulated widely after his passing.",
            "In the cold, unforgiving light of California law, could a customer that was maimed after stumbling upon an applesauce spill in a grocer's establishment find solace in punitive damages, arguing that the store's manager acted with malice, given that he was apprised of the hazard twice and remained unmoved, engrossed in his evening repast for a half-hour?\n\nA judge is not likely to summarily turn away Jennifer Palmer's plea for punitive damages. To sway the scales of justice in her favor, she must present evidence of the manager's reckless disregard for the probability of harm. Palmer may assert that the manager should have known the peril of leaving a spill uncleaned, given the previous incidents that had befallen other patrons in the months prior to her mishap. While the argument that his actions were abhorrent may not be persuasive, it holds weight, given the six slip-and-fall incidents that befell the store in 2009, and his persistent inaction.\n\nOn the thirteenth of October, 2009, at the witching hour of five o'clock PM, an employee of D&D Markets informed his overseer, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in the aisle. Martin's response was curt, \"I'm on dinner break, can't deal with customer whines.\" At fifteen minutes past, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, sounded the alarm once more, and the manager's reply remained unchanged. At thirty minutes past, Jennifer Palmer, the unfortunate plaintiff, slipped and fell, her back shattered in the process. Five such incidents had befallen the store in the year prior. Palmer seeks recompense for her injuries, both compensatory and punitive, and we find ourselves at a crossroads, contemplating a motion for partial summary against her claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn the Golden State, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of contract, if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The law defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or if absent intent, it must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Conduct is deemed malicious when it is committed with a conscious disregard of the probable dangerous consequences, and the defendant willfully and deliberately fails to avert those consequences.

            "Four years removed, I encountered a course in Islam at CBC that stirred a heated debate on whether the faith is inherently hostile. The years since 9/11 have only deepened the relevance of this query. Once, a candidate with the moniker Borac Obama, hailing from a Muslim lineage, seemed unimaginable in the halls of power.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me, for it paints a Muhammad starkly at odds with history. From my understanding, the Prophet compelled conversions through conquest, seizing tribes and imposing Islam by force. Yet, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humbled, drawing converts one by one to his 'truth.'\n\nThe parallels between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles' are striking. The loaves and fish, multiplied to sate forty men, reflect a style that seeks not to prove, but to live in truth and wonder. This, I fear, is a usurpation, a theft of Christ's person and life, a theft that diminishes the divine.\n\nMoreover, the biography brims with 'witnesses,' stories told from afar, heard second-hand, third-hand, ad infinitum. This third-party perspective, I find, weakens the stories, casting doubt upon them.\n\nWhat galls me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad, to mold him into a gentle, humble, wise, and godly paragon. History, however, contradicts this portrayal. Can Muslims today see the true face of the man who rose to power?",
            "The teachings of the Nazarene, as they were hewn from his earthly sojourn, were soon lost to the avarice of men who followed. In the wake of his crucifixion, the faith they claimed to follow strayed far from the path he trod. The world, today, bears witness to an unyielding march towards enlightenment, while those who cling to the old ways may yet resist the tide. Among the faithful, a deepening understanding of their history will stir a yearning to strip away the accretions of time and return to the pure essence of the faith's origin. This reversal, though gradual, is inevitable, as if the hands of time themselves turn backward, until only the words of the man from Galilee remain, unadorned by the thoughts of others. When this current sweeps through the heartland of the world's mightiest nations, it will find its strength in the enduring institutions it will lead. Yet, the uniformity of belief that follows will be like the calm after a storm, as the diversity of thought returns to the simplicity of his teachings, for there is only one truth, and many paths to it. The great reversion is not without precedent. The empire that once despised the faith now bears its name, and a nation that once shackled in darkness now leads the way. This too shall pass, and the faith of the Nazarene will be reborn in a world that seeks his simplicity once more. And so, we must ask, what has been lost since his time?",

The hearts of men, it seems, are hollowed out by a ceaseless hunger for power and wealth, heedless of those who labor beneath them. The grand factories, those behemoths of industry, stand as monuments to this insatiable greed, their owners and managers blind to the suffering they engender. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" Sinclair writes, \"here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" a choking, asphyxiating testament to their callous disregard for the world they despoil.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in their relentless machine, are treated as expendable, their pains and plight as irrelevant as the soot that clings to their bodies. Sinclair reveals, \"So from the top to the bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The owners, unencumbered by law or regulation, force their employees to toil in squalor, their backs bent under the yoke of unending labor. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers,\" Sinclair laments, his words cutting like a blade to the heart of the system that allows such misery to persist.\n\nAnd so, the workers are left to rot, their lives snuffed out like candles in the darkness of Packingtown, with no recourse, no hope, no escape from the despair that is their lot. Their only solace is the cold embrace of the grave, and the memory of the cold, hard truth that they were once alive, breathing, and free.",
            "In the grand tapestry of literature, each author weaves an intricate design to ensnare the reader's consciousness and tug at their heartstrings. Some, like F. Scott Fitzgerald, employ a linguistic alchemy, intermingling adjectives and nouns in unorthodox unions to cast a certain spell upon the reader. Fitzgerald's magnum opus, \"The Great Gatsby,\" is a veritable smorgasbord of such techniques. He imbues symbols with meaning, then wields them like a blade, cleaving the very fabric of reality.\n\nFitzgerald's chromatic symphony is a masterclass in evocation. White and gray, gold and green, red and pink, each hue is a note in his sonata of symbolism. The color white, for instance, is his scepter of uniformity, his banner of high station. In the novel's beginning, this color is ubiquitous. Daisy and Jordan are ever cloaked in white, a chaste shroud that belies their true nature. Nick, at Gatsby's resplendent parties, is a ghostly figure in white flannels. Even the mundane becomes resplendent in this color—Nick's journey to work is a descent into the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names on his timetable are as gray as the land of ashes.\n\nBut Fitzgerald does not merely paint with his colors; he uses them to signify, to underscore meaning. Daisy, after a prolonged absence from the white world, reemerges, \"dressed in white,\" a specter of her former self, a mere appendage to Gatsby's dream. The white roadster she drives is a ghostly apparition, a reminder of her past. Gray, too, is his tool, a veil of indifference. The \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" is a shroud, a barrier between her and the world. Even the dreary \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" are tainted with this pallid hue.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is not merely decorative; it is a language, a cipher that whispers secrets to the astute reader. It is a dance of light and shadow, a symphony of hue and tone. And in this dance, Fitzgerald leads us through the labyrinth of his novel, painting a portrait of a society where uniformity is a disease, and the color of one's skin is a badge of one's station.",
            "In the sun-baked heart of San Diego County, where the land yields abundantly to the kind touch of the sun and the gentle caress of the sea, the soil is not merely tilled but kissed into life. Here, the fields are a tapestry of green, woven with the threads of tomatoes, citrus, and leaves that whisper in the breeze. Squash and broccoli, herbs and berries, the sweet kiss of peaches and lemons, and the fiery dance of peppers - all grow here, nurtured by the mild, sun-kissed climate and the patient hands of farmers who tend to the earth like it were their own flesh.\n\nA market for such organic bounty stirs, a hunger that has birthed a community of growers who offer not just sustenance, but experience. Tours of their earthly sanctuaries, where the air is alive with the song of birds and the hum of bees, where the soil is rich with life and the spirit of the land. Here, the farmer finds not just a way to fill their pockets, but to fill their soul.\n\nYet, the path is not without its trials. The organic way, it seems, is a dance with hardship. The absence of chemicals is a burden, a calloused hand that needs constant care. Pests and weeds, they grow in the absence of poisons, and the soil, it demands a more intimate touch, a constant tending. The scale may be small, but the heart is wide, and the land, it gives back - in biodiversity, in joy, in spirit.\n\nThe parcel chosen, a testament to nature's resilience, is a patchwork of chaparral, exotic grasslands, and oak woodlands, nestled against the ancient heart of the Cleveland National Forest. It is a land that breathes, that lives, that is home to more than a hundred souls - some endangered, some declining, all precious. Here, the ghosts of the past whisper in the wind, the echoes of Native American feet and cattle hooves, the ghosts of cordwood sellers who once called this land theirs.\n\nThe land, it speaks of a heritage, a responsibility. It calls for more than just tending, more than just tilling. It calls for a partnership, a dance with nature, a symphony of life. And so, the farmer seeks not just the help of government, but the wisdom of the land, the spirit of the earth. For this is not just a farm, but a sanctuary, a testament to the power of the organic way, a call to arms for the future of the land.",
            "Culture, it is said, doth play a significant role in the dance of negotiation. One might define it as much by what it doth not encompass as by what it doth. It is not a homogenous beast, nor a singular thing, nor uniform in its form. Assertions such as \"all Russians are stubborn,\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are broad and simplistic, mere generalizations that serve to obscure rather than illuminate. A negotiator would be well-served to understand the import of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture's attitude may impact the table talks. When one approaches a foreign shore, one experiences it through the lens of their own culture, and comparisons, like the ghosts of old battles, are inevitable.\n\nTo understand a foreign culture or mindset, one must delve deep, like a miner seeking gold. It may involve poring over history, grappling with prejudices, or simply observing the patterns that unfold before one's eyes. Rather than judge or attempt to reshape, one must simply accept a culture for what it is, and work within its bounds, especially so when one finds oneself at the table with a weaker hand. And when on 'away' soil, respect for traditions and beliefs can be the key that unlocks the door to progress.\n\nCulture, it should be noted, is not confined to national or international borders. Within a given nation, companies forge their own cultures, each unique as a snowflake. Some may demand long hours, others a relaxed pace. Signs of corporate culture are visible in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some encourage philanthropy from any quarter, while others steer it to \"company-approved\" causes. The diversity of thought within American corporations, from coast to coast, is a testament to this. Some cultures may appear uniform to the outsider, but beneath the surface lies a world as complex and varied as the human heart.\n\nValues, too, are paramount. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company or superior to gain the upper hand. Conversely, a negotiator who hails from a culture that prizes a hard bargain will not settle for the first offer. A negotiator should be well-versed in these generalities before stepping into the arena. Yet, to truly make the negotiation effective, one must learn something of their opponent on a personal level. For it is not just the culture that shapes us, but the individuals who embody it.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" The words of Psalm 14 and the opening of St. Anselm's argument are but the first gust in the wind of theological inquiry. The same storm, one might say, bears Thomas Aquinas' words, who, like his predecessor, seeks to prove the existence of God. However, to compare their arguments, we must first accept that they both believe in the God of the Bible, for any other deity would muddy the waters of our discussion.\n\nSt. Anselm, in his Proslogion, suggests a path of self-discovery, a journey inward to find the divine. He argues that God's existence is inherent in our understanding, and thus, we cannot conceive of His non-existence. This is a faith-based logic, one that requires no empirical evidence, but rather, trusts in the truth that we already know within our souls. This is a common theme in Christianity, a belief that faith, not facts, is the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\n\nThomas Aquinas, however, treads a different path. He believes that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone. This approach, he argues, is beneficial for evangelism, as it allows one to persuade others through logic, rather than relying on their willingness to accept the unknown. His Five Ways are a demonstration of this logic: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument suggests that God's existence is a logical necessity, like knowing the piece of a puzzle that's missing, but its shape and existence can be known through the rest.\n\nIn both cases, we see a belief in God's existence, though the path to that belief is different, and neither provides a holistic basis for belief. For while faith and reason may lead us to God, they do not necessarily bring us to the same place, and perhaps, that's where the truth lies, in the journey, not just the destination.",
            "In the waning days of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born, latter to be known as Buddha. Over the span of his mortal existence, he left behind the trappings of the world and attained enlightenment, setting forth a path that would foster the birth of Buddhism - the most orthodox of which is Theravada. This faith, now some twenty-five hundred years old, bears little resemblance to its original form. Take, for instance, the island of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike partake in this ritual, a practice that Buddha himself never taught. Such variances extend from surface customs to the very essence of the religion. The Theravada community, both monastic and lay, has had to modify its doctrinal principles over time, a process shaped by forces both within and without, both friendly and malicious.\n\nI shall employ a few terms throughout this discourse. Internal forces are those born of the adherents of Buddhism, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or seek to harm the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces are those that neither wish to harm nor aid the community, though their actions may have unintended consequences.\n\nFirst, let us explore the fundamental tenets of this religion - the doctrines that lie at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Three Jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the essence of the Buddha's teachings, is comprised of the Tripitaka - the Three Baskets. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical components. The notion of Anatta - no self, Dukkha - inherent suffering, and Anicca - impermanence of all things - are central to this metaphysics. Only by acknowledging these truths can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Along with this, lobha - desire, dosa - hatred, and moha - delusion - will cease, and one shall become enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, for laymen and monks alike. Laymen adhere to five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not partake in intoxicants. Monks are bound by many more disciplinary rules. The most fundamental teaching is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha - life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "In the annals of world history, few rivalries burn with such fervency as the one that once engulfed the United States and Mexico, a feud that raged for fifty-seven long years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The apex of this enmity was reached during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States, like a hungry wolf, devoured the territories of Texas and the American Southwest, leaving Mexico bereft and humbled. In the interim, numerous skirmishes erupted between the two nations, not unlike the sparks that ignite a prairie fire, until the First World War finally extinguished the flames. (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThe seeds of this enmity were sown in the early days, when Americans and Mexicans clashed over matters of religion, culture, and tradition, as well as in the realm of material interests. It was a clash of ideals, a struggle for dominance, much like the ideological wars that have divided nations throughout history. The Americans, inheritors of the English way, and the Mexicans, heirs to the Spanish, were locked in a dance of distrust, a pas de deux of suspicion. (Frahm 2001 p. 86).\n\nThe list of disputes between Mexico and the United States, as chronicled by Diehl and Goerts (2000), is a testament to this enduring enmity. Seventeen grievances, each a chip in the armor of their shared border, each a testament to the constant skirmishes waged over territory. Bandits and outlaws, like ghostly specters, haunted the borders, their raids a constant reminder of the simmering conflict. (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nAs the years wore on, the tide of the rivalry turned. Mexico, once a proud, independent nation, became increasingly dependent on the United States, a new, more insidious form of occupation. And as American ambitions shifted, from territorial expansion to economic intervention, the rivalry began to wane, like a dying ember. (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I found myself felled by a malady I had never known, a shadow that descended upon me in the prime of my life. I had been a nurse, a profession chosen out of a desperation for the safety and certainty that had eluded me in my youth. \"Always work, always sickness,\" the words echoed through my adolescence and beyond, and so I forged ahead, even as my heart yearned for the realms of science and journalism. But fate had other plans, and at forty-six, I found myself crippled, alone, and penniless.\n\nThe world shifted beneath me, a storm that has raged for fifteen long years. I am a man adrift, clinging to Social Security Disability, a lifeline that has seen me through, yet left me bereft of anything truly my own. Each day is a battle, a test of my resolve, my security, my very self. Yet, there is one truth etched in these harsh years: I would not have endured were it not for the kindness of my family and a few steadfast friends. When calamity strikes, one cannot stand alone.\n\nEmergencies, they come in all shapes and sizes, and no preparations can guard against them all. We must learn to trust each other again, to lend a hand, to seek help when we need it. We cannot rely on a crumbling government to catch us when we fall. Our forefathers did not conquer the Rockies alone; they rode in wagon trains, united in their quest. And so, I say, be ready. But do not forget, as you gather your supplies and prepare your defenses, to open your heart to your neighbors.\n\nI have my disaster kit, my first aid, my water purifying tablets, and my plastic sheeting. I have flashlights and batteries, candles and matches, cans of food. I have a small farm and a wood stove, if the land and resources allow. But I also have a community, and I will not let it be forgotten.",
            "Why do creatures unfurl in this peculiar manner, as if governed by some unseen hand? Are there limitations or boundaries that dictate the course of their evolution? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson mused, \"Even now, the zoologist has barely begun to whisper in the language of mathematics the simplest organic shapes.\" Yet, here we stand, delving into the unknown, seeking to unravel the mechanisms that guide the transformation and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. Our investigation encompasses a fusion of mathematical modeling and experimental inquiry, a symphony of the theoretical and the tangible.\n\nWe employ X-radiographic images of Prunum species to pinpoint quantitative parameters, which are then fed into the software program CerioShell. Our models, like the shell itself, are a journey through 360 degrees of space, a spiral dance around the central axis known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls expand, the continuous line dividing each, the suture—these are the notes in our symphony, each one a whisper of the shell's story.\n\nThe shell, a testament to time and space, can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. In the usual orientation, the aperture points towards the viewer, and the apex, like a lighthouse, points skyward. The animal, a sailor in its shell, extends through an aperture, a window to the world outside.\n\nTo chart the course of the aperture, one must trace its path through time and space as the mollusk builds its shell. This trajectory, a graph of coordinates, can be mathematically represented, allowing us to vary parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The toll of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained stubbornly unchanged for a decade. As it approaches the end of the Millennium Development Goals, the nation's progress in water and sanitation far outpaces its advances in child and maternal health. The causes of this disparity are manifold, pointing to a need not for isolated interventions but for a fortification of the health system as a whole.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled workers, with 72% now meeting the target. Yet, this figure includes traditional midwives who lack the medical prowess to intervene in complicated pregnancies. Their inclusion skews the numbers, a stark reminder of the work yet to be done. Moreover, the rate of diarrheal cases treated by health professionals in children under five has dropped, and postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCaesarean section rates remain low, hovering around 4%, with urban areas performing significantly better than rural ones. This disparity underscores the inequitable distribution of healthcare services, heavily favoring urban areas. Additionally, the gap between the poorest and richest quintiles in service utilization is a staggering 27%, highlighting the financial barriers to healthcare for the impoverished.\n\nWith these issues in mind, the question arises: should Indonesia focus on targeted programmatic approaches or bolster the overall healthcare system? Programmatic interventions offer clear, manageable objectives and faster results. However, they have their drawbacks. Heavy investment in one area often starves others of funding and resources. Furthermore, the proliferation of uncoordinated, duplicative programs leads to an increase in administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature, with its meticulous attention to detail and abiding by the aristocratic norms of the era, is often constrained by a rigid adherence to tradition. Yet, amidst this rigid structure, two novels stand out: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works, like a lone wolf among the flock, embrace the strange and the untoward, employing a tincture of mystery and the bizarre that lends depth to their characters and insights into their motivations and emotions. Dickens, in Oliver Twist, captures this essence as he writes:\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels employ this mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though their function varies. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often unveil Oliver’s inner turmoil, his fears, and his awareness of the true nature of the events around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, he relives the experience as if in a dream, grappling for help. The passage underscores his lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as his dire physical state, reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbs all his senses, leaving him to experience his despair anew, unshocked by the pain, which now flows as constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. This lack of control over his fate forces the question: Whose will brought about his misfortune? For it was certainly not his own. The growing sense of defeat in Oliver is palpable, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, so that he can no longer react, even in the face of his own life.\n\n“And the day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.” (Dickens)",
            "A couple of years back, I found myself toiling as a tutor in an after-school program, helping young ones with their studies. My talents lay in the English and reading realms, yet I was roped into assisting a lad named Adrian, who was struggling mightily with his letters. The boy's predicament was peculiar. Some letters he'd pronounce as if he'd been born to the tongue, others he'd mangle like a drunken man. He hailed from a Latin household, but his English was as smooth as a river's flow. We wrestled with his struggles until fate intervened in the form of his mother, who swept into the room like a storm at sea. She spoke no English, only Spanish, and my grasp of the tongue was tenuous at best. We managed to communicate, though it was clumsy and stilted. And then it struck me like a thunderclap: the boy could read, but he was lost in the alphabet's maze.\n\nThis tale serves to illuminate the shadow cast by language barriers in our schools, particularly here in California. It's not always as clear as it seems. Even a child who speaks English like a native can be lost in the labyrinth of letters. We agree that this problem festers, so what's the remedy? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation, sufficed. Yet for those who barely speak the tongue, the solution is a tangled web.\n\nThe dual language system, a notion that's been given short shrift, could be a boon. It's not just for Spanish-speaking children, but for all. Research shows that those in such programs outperform their peers. Yet there's a fear that it's a waste of resources, that the majority will derive no benefit. This is a fallacy. If we integrated these programs into our classrooms, all children would reap the rewards. But how best to implement this? Should we insist on bilingual teachers? No, that's unrealistic. But having bilingual aides or tutors, that's something we could manage.",
            "From the moment we first draw breath, we are told there exists a force greater than ourselves, a void we cannot fathom. Some of us are instructed in its ways, while others turn to the temple or delve into the depths of their souls for answers. Many embrace the creeds passed down by those who came before, but some scoff at the notion, rejecting any notion of a world beyond our own egos. We traverse different paths, each seeking to define ourselves through our unique perceptions of the divine. We search for a guiding light to break the shadows that surround us.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" my father replied when I inquired about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the rain's relentless drumming on the tin roof accompanied by the steady rhythm of our cigarettes. The gutters gushed, extinguishing the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, his eyes reflecting an eternal search and a lingering memory. His once ample frame now hung loosely on him, his hair thinned and sparse. His gaze lingered on the rain, avoiding mine. I felt isolated, frightened, and unable to express the pain I would feel when he was gone, lest it become a reality for both of us. I embraced him tightly, moved my chair closer, and stared out into the June twilight's falling rain with him.\n\nIn December, five days after I reached the age of twenty-two, my father passed. The doctors' projections were bested only by the chemotherapy and radiation, which prolonged his suffering. What purpose it served, I could not comprehend. I lay in bed for three nights, curled into a ball and awaiting the news. No one telephoned.",
            "The so-called \"Gothic Novel,\" in essence a strange marriage of \"Old\" and \"New,\" as Ian Watt posits in his study, has been both reviled and revered, deemed shallow or profound, and celebrated for its capacity to evoke the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The first of such tales, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, fused the ancient and modern to birth the nascent Gothic mode, introducing a novel method of literary expression. Walpole, in his crafting of \"A Gothic Story,\" wove together old theatrical elements and new mimicry of nature, as seen in modern novels, to create a unique blend that would resonate through time. The Gothic genre, with its throwbacks to medieval theater, architecture, and tradition, baffled contemporaries, appearing archaic and unsophisticated in the face of modern societal and literary progress. Yet, it is this very fusion that allows Gothic to endure, forever new and obsolete to the displaced reader.\n\nChivalry, a cornerstone of Gothic fiction, is a prominent theme in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Walpole's work preserves and transforms the medieval ideal of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, reflecting his disillusionment with contemporary society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, Walpole romanticizes the past, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romanticism, as a means to aspire to a better present. Walpole, a man entangled in political turmoil and unfair accusations, may have felt the morality and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had vanished in his contemporaries. This is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits before our eyes ever meet him. His description includes phrases of a \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" a figure exaggerated, as is the Gothic tendency towards excess (66).",
            "The ceaseless dance of goods through the vast expanse of commerce, from the first whisper of a customer's desire to the final denouement of satisfaction, is what we know as supply chain management. Conceived in the crucible of 1982 by one Keith Oliver, a man of enterprise, it is the art of planning, executing, and guiding the ebb and flow of the supply chain to satisfy the customer's need with swift, efficient grace.\n\nSix are the cornerstones upon which this edifice is built: production, supply, inventory, location, conveyance, and knowledge. The manager, like the conductor of an orchestra, employs these elements to ensure the symphony of commerce plays to the customer's delight.\n\n**Production**, the first and foundational step, is the birthplace of the supply chain's essence. Here, the managers, as the midwives of industry, must discern the will of the market, the mother from whom all demands are born. The market, a vast, impersonal entity, tells us what the customer wants, and the manager, like a seer, deciphers its omens. Once the market's secrets are revealed, the manager decides what products shall be born and how many of them shall see the light of day. The where and how follow, with the manager choosing the plant that best serves the customer's needs, balancing volume and quality in the delicate dance of production.\n\nThe next key element, **supply**, is the strategic heart of the supply chain. Here, the manager decides the core capabilities of the facility and the paths of partnerships with others. For a single product, a company may have many divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the best division for each process, like a master selecting the most skilled artisans for a task. Outsourcing may be the manager's choice, to quicken the pace, to inject flexibility and reduce costs, or to maintain the low, steady hum of efficiency.",
            "In the grimy heart of Burma, a land where the junta's iron grip stifles the voice of the people, a lone figure stands, cardboard sign held aloft like a flag of defiance. The words scrawled in Sharpie are a stark reminder: \"Hitler lives.\" Burma, or Myanmar, a nation where the scent of violence and oppression hang heavy in the air, has a history of subjugation that echoes through the generations. The monks, their saffron robes a beacon of hope, took to the streets in 2007, their chants echoing through the empty halls of power. But the junta's response was swift and brutal, monasteries laid waste, journalists imprisoned, and a photojournalist named Kenji Nagai gunned down for the crime of bearing witness.\n\nThe world is not new to such atrocities. The Roman emperors, with their god-king pretenses, the Japanese emperors and their divine right to rule, even the current president, Bush, with his weekly communions with Ted Haggard, all share a common thread of absolute power and the suppression of dissent. The Tiananmen Square massacre, where the cries of freedom were silenced by tanks, the Rwandan genocide, where the river ran red with innocent blood, and Hitler's Third Reich, where the Holocaust's shadow still looms over Europe - these are but a few instances of humanity's darkest hour.\n\nThe sign, Ellen Page's sign, is a testament to the human spirit's refusal to be broken. It is a beacon of defiance in the face of tyranny, a spark that can ignite a flame. For the world is not new to darkness, but perhaps, through such acts of bravery, it can be made anew.",
            "In this brutal, unforgiving world of jazz, Duke Ellington carved out a legacy that endured like a ancient stone beneath the earth. He was a master of his craft, a damn near sage in the realm of sound. His fingers danced upon the keys of his piano, subtle as the whisper of wind through leaves, yet his compositions were as vast and intricate as the darkest nights under the New Orleans moon.\n\nEllington's genius lay in his ability to shape his orchestra much like a god shapes a world. The piano, his instrument, was a voice in this symphony of souls he conducted. He composed pieces that were rich and complex, each note a pebble in a river that flowed with the individual talents of his band members. He crafted a stage where soloists could improvise like the wild, untamed spirits of the South, yet he also wrote phrases and melodies that called for each player's unique voice. In doing so, he created a tone so distinct, so original, that it echoed across the decades.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, a tome of sacred knowledge, speaks of Ellington's sound and innovation. It mentions Creole Love Call, a piece wherein he used the human voice as a jazz instrument, adding texture and color without the burden of lyrics. This early experiment was but one of many examples of Ellington's ear for tone and his ability to complement the voices of his soloists. Creole Love Call, a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues, is a tapestry of call and response between voice and reeds, each chorus a dance of the soul. Chorus by chorus, Ellington weaves a spellbinding narrative, from the smooth, melodic opening to the rough, growling finish. The final chorus, a return to the first, sees the voice take on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument of the gods. It is a masterclass in tone, a symphony of sound.\n\nHot and Bothered, recorded the year following, finds Ellington combining his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing engage in a call and response, the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice creating a sound that is rich and complementary. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton introducing the melody on muted trombone, his sound as unique and haunting as a ghost in the night.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to his pieces is but one of the many stylistic traits that permeated his work. He was a composer of the highest order, a pioneer in the art of jazz. His legacy lives on, as eternal as the stars above the Mississippi delta.",
            "She'd always felt that something was missing, a void that gnawed at her, a yearning that refused to be sated. It began when she was barely fourteen, as she stumbled into the labyrinth of adolescence. Three years hence, at seventeen, she still sought, though her hunger had shifted from thing to person. Yet, no youth appealed to her, not even those who made their clumsy advances. She puzzled over this, her mind a whirlwind of theories and conjectures, each as fleeting as the morning dew. So she lived, and questioned, and waited.\n\nQuiet days at home, under the roof of her placid parents, were rare though she loved them well. Her father's calm demeanor, her mother's quiet fortitude, they never argued, not with each other, nor with their daughter. Except, perhaps, when she asserted her independence, her spirit wild as a stallion. Yet, she was their daughter, their beloved, her personality a beacon of light in their serene home.\n\nBut today was not one of those days. As she wandered the rooms, seeking some spark of inspiration for herself, she heard a cry, a wail that echoed through the house. It was her mother's voice, and it was filled with pain. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart pounding in her chest, her breath coming in short gasps. \"Mother? Mother, what is wrong?\" she cried out, her voice shaking.\n\nShe found her mother on the floor, writhing in agony, her breaths coming in short, sharp clips. \"Ow,\" she gasped, her voice barely audible. \"Sweet, take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter did not hesitate. She gathered her mother in her arms, her muscles straining under the weight, and carried her to the car. The drive was a blur, her mind filled with fear and worry, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nThe hospital was a place of antiseptic and suffering, a place of fear and pain. But she did not sense it, for her mind was occupied with her mother. She rushed her inside, her voice echoing through the halls as she called for help. Doctors and nurses swarmed around them, their faces etched with worry, and one of them gently guided her to a chair, leaving her to sit in anxious anticipation.\n\nIt turned out, her mother had fallen from a stool, trying to reach a vase in the highest cabinet. The vase was untouched, but her mother's body had taken the brunt of the fall.",
            "This study sought to illuminate the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as gauged by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", and the mitigation of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a variant of the Med diet, emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while deeming animal products and saturated fats as less desirable. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted within this regimen.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have established an inverse correlation between compliance with the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. In an intervention trial, the Med diet proved more effective than a low-fat diet in facilitating weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, these studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, between the ages of 38 and 63, who were free from cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes. Participants were drawn from the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses residing in 11 US states. Over the course of six assessments, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were deemed \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo account for random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to assess the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of both incident CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (both fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the year of Our Lord, two thousand and seven, the United States of America was beset by a calamitous financial crisis. Unemployment rose like a spectral tide, the housing market crumbled as if struck by a divine wrath, and many of her most vaunted corporations lay in ruin, their towers reduced to empty shells. This recession, a scourge upon the land, continues to this day, and we are compelled to inquire: how did this catastrophe come to pass, and how may we forestall its recurrence?\n\nThe roots of this calamity can be traced back to the Clinton administration, in the year of Our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, as the President sought to secure his reelection by pandering to the whims of the people. To this end, he relaxed lending restrictions, thus setting the stage for the sub-prime debacle that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes, a journalist of the New York Times, warned of the perils that lay ahead: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes, in his prescient wisdom, foresaw the consequences of their folly: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" Thus, the seeds of our doom were sown.\n\nThe crisis was not a singular event, but a confluence of many factors. Among them was the emergence of a new and labyrinthine mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) became the order of the day, ensnaring more and more sectors of the economy in the housing market's grasp. This led to a state of overextension, a kind of mania that left households and financial markets alike vulnerable to even the slightest fluctuations in price.\n\nThe housing bubble, like some monstrous beast, burst forth with devastating force. The investment banks that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left with a bitter taste in their mouths, for they were now confronted with debts in excess of four trillion dollars, accounting for nearly a third of our GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercially regulated entities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with their five trillion dollars in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September of two thousand and eight.",
            "Ah, the realm of exposition.  A place where some authors take flight with their quill, their words painting vivid images that captivate, or a place where readers' eyes glaze over and their fingers fleetingly hover over the \"Back\" button, cursing the author's name.  Dr. Merlin, she has known such a fate, standing before her monitor, her brow furrowed, her voice raised in exasperation at the excess of words, the overwhelming tide of information.\n\nExposition, it is not your friend.\n\nThe lesson, \"Show, don't tell,\" is well-known, yet it is a lesson that Dr. Merlin, she still struggles with.  Like a wayward horse, she finds herself atop a mountain of words, with naught but the silence of the desert and the echo of her own thoughts to meet her halfway.  The devil on her shoulder, it whispers, \"Get the story on its way, get to the meat of it.\"  But the devil on the other shoulder, it urges, \"Tell them every detail, every twist, every tear that makes up your characters.\"\n\nExposition, it is the simple telling of what has been, what is, what will be.  In the theater of words, it is the actor who takes the stage and spouts lines, the audience's eyes wide and ears alert, yet somehow, not fully engaged.  In the realm of fiction, it is the author who takes the pen and paints the picture, the canvas filled with details, yet the colors muted, the image blurry.\n\nConsider the tale of the heroine and her love.  You would not expect, in the telling of their story, that the author would spend two pages, their words flowing like a river, the lovers only getting two lines of speech.  You would expect, you would crave, the author to flesh out the man, to show him through his words, his actions, his very being, how he loved his wife.  And you would expect the same from the woman, to see her through his eyes, to understand the depth of their bond, the richness of their love.  You would mourn his death with her, and in doing so, you would grow closer to her, to her heart, her dreams, her very essence.\n\nIn short, you would expect more than just the simple tale.  \"They met, they married, he died.\"  A tale told too briefly, too plainly.  As a writer, you must provide more.  The bread, you must wrap it in meat, you must season it, you must let it rest.  You must let it become a feast, a symphony of words that captivates, that leaves the reader's heart aching, their soul yearning for more.  For that is the power of exposition, not to merely tell, but to weave a tapestry of words, a story that lives, that breathes, that is more than just words on a page.",
            "In the chill of a Columbus dawn, I bore witness to two broadcasts from the belly of the beast, the city's appetite for the grim spectacle of its own making. The first, an NBC forum, spewed forth its tidings with a certain lethargic urgency. A man named Shad Hostettler, his features etched with the malevolence of a thousand lost souls, had been taken for the murder of his wife, her name a whisper on the wind. Her blood, spilled in the quiet of Ashley, Ohio, was but a fleeting tale, a mere two minutes' respite from the day's unsavory offerings. The second, a tale of a youth named Travis Buyers, shot down in the cold embrace of Sharon Woods, was told with a certain reserve, the color of his skin a shadow over the truth.\n\nThe third tale, a bullet's footprint upon a Med-Flight's metal skin, spoke of a .22 caliber's song, a dance with death. Crime-Stoppers, with their five-thousand dollar reward, were the symphony's conductors, the dance's choreographers. The fourth, a teaser for the weekend's storm, was but a fleeting thought, a whisper of the weather's wrath. The fifth, a robbery on Clime Road, was a report of a dark-skinned man, a Hoodie's specter, a vulture's cry. His features were described with a certain relish, the color of his skin a stark detail, a curiosity.\n\nThe final tale was of a man named Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic drug kingpin, his sentence a curious thing, not twenty-five years, but three hundred months, a march of time. His hue, it seemed, was a detail to be noted, a curiosity, a whisper in the wind.",
            "A bond between brothers, a tether that cannot be sundered, a bond as immutable as the wilds of the world, unyielding in its grip. Within it, emotions swirl like a storm, a tempestuous dance of love and loathing, of pride and jealousy, of cruelty and compassion. Brothers, they see themselves in each other, a mirror reflection in the eyes of their kin. It is in the direst of times that this bond reveals its true face, both in its grace and its malevolence. The cost is high, the price exacted in actions and their aftermath. To see oneself in a brother is to see not as others see, but as one truly is. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers wade through a verdant, vivid landscape, a stage for their futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with fierce pride in their climactic encounter, and only one emerges alive. This theme unfurls through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's eyes, which convey the protagonist's complex feelings and their impact on his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's heart is a battleground, a landscape sculpted by a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fatal expedition, he feels a gnawing resentment towards Doodle. He sought a brother who could be his equal, one to share his world with, to race to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine's top fork. But Doodle's frail heart, a fragile thing, made such dreams impossible. The young boy's head filled with wild fantasies, crushed in an instant. He, even, contemplated death's cold embrace for his brother, a thought born of bitter frustration. Yet, a simple smile from the child could melt his heart, a hope that gave his conviction a moment's pause. Deep within, a love for his brother burned, a love that could not be extinguished.",
            "The human brain, a labyrinthine tapestry of thought and perception, has long been the subject of metaphor and inquiry, much like the ancient maps that once doubled for the unkown. Initially, it was likened to a simple wax tablet, plain and unchanging, yet it quickly evolved into the sprawling expanse of a parchment scroll, then the bound tomes of libraries, and now, the cold, unyielding circuit board of a machine.\n\nTo grasp the brain's enigma, consider the humble inputs of the senses, the eyes, ears, and fingertips that translate the world into electrochemical signals - a strange alchemy of flesh and fire. These signals are then woven through the brain's algorithms, a dance of bottom-up and top-down, where each step builds upon the last, like the scaffolding of a grand cathedral. The world is perceived, recognized, and understood, with the aid of the brain's attention, a fickle sentinel that guides our awareness through the tide of sensation.\n\nMemory, too, is a vast and mysterious landscape, where information is encoded, stored, and maintained in the brain's strange architecture. The types of memory are as varied as the grains of sand on a desert shore, from the fleeting moments of sensory memory, to the vast expanse of long-term memory, where information is held in the very structure of proteins, as if carved into the stone of the mind.\n\nMany are the models that seek to explain the brain's organization, from the human experience of memory retrieval, to the cold logic of computer science, and the dance of neurons. One such model, the semantic network, posits a web of nodes and links, where concepts are like stars in a constellated sky, connected by their relatedness, a web of meaning spun from the threads of thought.",
            "In the realm of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a dystopian landscape looms large, where the specter of technology and capitalistic structures intertwine to create a chilling tableau. The citizens of this world, born into a system that prioritizes community over the individual, are conditioned from the cradle to pursue immediate gratification. They are, in truth, mere pawns in a grand design orchestrated by the World Controller, a puppet master who tugs at the strings of their existence. Through the lens of Marxist critique, the author's suspicions are laid bare, as the story unfolds like a cautionary tale against the excesses of economic systems.\n\nCapitalism is laid bare in the novel's stark portrayal, where the Marxist concept of false consciousness prevails. The common folk, blinded by their own desires, are kept from understanding the true dynamics of their economic plight. Ideological control has rendered them slaves to their consumerist impulses, their wills subsumed into the machinery of capitalism. The conditioning they undergo, through hypnopædia, stokes the fires of consumption and indulgence, manipulated by the World Controller to maintain the status quo.\n\nThe notion of hegemony is evident in Huxley's vision, as the lower classes are kept in the dark about their own oppression. The Delta, Gamma, and Gamma classes, content in their stations, are merely cogs in a wheel, unaware of the manipulation that keeps them in their place. The upper classes, born with the ability to see beyond their stations, choose to remain silent, few exceptions like Bernard or other characters only serving to highlight the prevailing komplizen passive acceptance.\n\nHuman connections are as shallow as the novel's characters, each a carbon copy of the last. The lack of depth and complexity in their interactions mirrors the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism, robbing individuals of their free will and expression. Love, and the extremes of emotion, are absent, replaced by superficial interactions that reduce individuals to their physical attributes or fleeting encounters. This societal structure, a mirror of Marxist thought, reflects the proletariat's false sense of superiority, so long as they continue to consume, obey, and remain in the fold.",
            "I've been abiding amongst these hallowed halls for near on two and a half years now, a span of four and a half learning seasons. The sprawl of this campus, once a vast and uncharted territory, now feels as crowded as a cathedral during mass. The East Halls, where I was once sequestered, stand as a testament to the campus's relentless expansion, a relic of times when vast stretches of untamed land lay between the student and the heart of knowledge. Now, those same fields are filled with sports arenas, or the new Creamery and health services building, and the encroachment of apartments, all bearing down on the dwindling sanctuaries of quiet contemplation.\n\nIn times past, these expanses were traversed by the sure-footed and the intrepid, but as the campus grew, so too did the distance between the student and the classroom. The bicycle, once a symbol of freedom and simplicity, now appears a necessity, a means to navigate this ever-expanding labyrinth.\n\nI spoke to a fellow traveler, a comrade in this journey of academia, who had recently rediscovered the pleasures of the two-wheeled steed. \"Why did we ever stop?\" he mused, \"Bikes are the only way to traverse these distances.\" And he was right. The bicycle, a simple and efficient conveyance, carries one from one end of the campus to the other, as swiftly as the wind through the trees. A bowl of porridge and a few minutes of exertion can span a considerable distance. Yet, the path to the Thomas Building, a mere twenty-five-minute walk, becomes a mere five-minute jaunt on a bicycle, a saving of time that is both precious and necessary.\n\nYet, the road is not always kind. Pollock Road, the most direct path, is a treacherous one, a gauntlet of broken glass and potholes. And in the cold and the rain, the journey becomes a true test of endurance. But the alternatives, the alternatives of walking, are even more daunting. The thought of spending an extra half hour to an hour each day on foot, a total of more than two and a half hours each week, is a heavy burden to bear. The bicycle, despite its flaws, remains the swiftest and most reliable mode of transport.\n\nThe campus, in its ceaseless growth, must adapt to the needs of its inhabitants. The bicycle, a symbol of both simplicity and progress, must be embraced, not just for the sake of efficiency, but for the sake of the students themselves. For in this age of constant motion, to be still is to fall behind."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I am drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I intend to dedicate my life to the healing of children who have suffered abuse or neglect, and to offer support to families teetering on the precipice of ruin. The values that I bring to this endeavor are as follows: unyielding service, respect for the dignity of all, a steadfast commitment to ethical behavior, and an unwavering dedication to the improvement of relationships and my own professional growth. These are not merely professional ideals; they are the very bedrock of my being.\n\nSince my youth, I have been a beacon for those in need, though I was once uncertain of the path that would lead me to my true calling. In the hallowed halls of high school and college, I beheld many a soul retreating from their troubles in a futile dance with denial, and some who adopted coping mechanisms that were as twisted as the shadows they sought to escape. Witnessing such scenes, I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Yet, even with this education, I was no closer to my true calling until that fateful summer, when I visited a friend and encountered a sixteen-year-old boy, trembling on her couch like a fawn in a storm. He had fled his home, seeking refuge from an abusive parent. The next day, I learned that he had called the police. I offered my assistance, and when the law could offer no solace, I sought the parents, hoping to shed light upon the darkness that had befallen their son. But their excuses were as thin as their nerve, their explanations for their actions as hollow as their hearts. That day, I began to see the path that was laid before me: a career in social work, a path that would lead me to the broken and abused, and offer them a beacon of hope in the darkness.\n\nBut beyond the pursuit of my own redemption, I am guided by a deeper call: the pursuit of social justice. Our society claims to hold the individual as sacred, yet we mourn them not for their uniqueness, but for their conformity to the mores of tradition. I am an individual, and I will not bind myself by the chains of societal expectation. From the halls of high school to the quadrilateral of college, I have stood against injustice, coloring my hair in hues that defied convention, dressing in clothing that reflected my true self, piercing my ears to the limit, and declaring my membership in the GSBA, fighting against the scourges of racism and discrimination wherever I found them. I am an advocate for social justice, and I will continue to stand against the tides of injustice that seek to drown us all.",
            "In these pages, we delve into the encroaching specter of insomnia, a blight that plagues both body and mind. We invoke two models to frame our understanding: the biological and the sociocultural. The former plumbs the depths of inherited traits and physical malaises, while the latter charts the tumultuous waters of environment and societal circumstances.\n\nInsomnia, a bugbear of the night, manifests in myriad forms. It is a primary disorder, a scourge of another mental affliction, or a by-product of medical ills or substance abuse. Dyssomnias, the primary disorders, include insomnia and hypersomnia, while parasomnias—behavioral or physiological anomalies—range from nightmare disorders to sleepwalking.\n\nOur focus is on insomnia, a shadow that hovers over consciousness, robbing it of rest. The biological model, a labyrinth of genes and physiology, reveals that neurons in the hypothalamus, bearing the orexin neuropeptide, govern slumber and wakefulness. Research with mice, those tiny sentinels of the night, uncovers that GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are the sentinels of sleep and wakefulness. Activated, they promote sleep; inhibited, they induce wakefulness. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep in mice, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for this receptor in humans. However, a flaw or absence thereof could render one a slave to sleeplessness, a curse that seeps into every aspect of life, from school to work, from focus to monotony.\n\nThe sociocultural model, meanwhile, examines the shackles of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. It posits that the very environment in which we are born and live can dictate our sleep patterns. A phenotype inherited from generations past could regulate our sleep, while an alteration in this receptor could disrupt it, casting a pall over our lives.\n\nBut remember, these are but models, frameworks to understand the labyrinthine nature of sleep. They illuminate aspects, but they do not dispel the darkness entirely. The journey into insomnia's heart is long and fraught with uncertainty. Yet, we must press on, for understanding lies not in the end, but in the path itself.",
            "The labyrinthine disorder known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or its less cumbersome sibling Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is the inefficiency and ineffectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes what we hear. Defined in its most stark terms, (C)AP is the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underpins this processing, culminating in those peculiar electrophysiologic auditory potentials. It is a condition in which the brain, that most enigmatic organ, fails to translate sound into meaningful perception. The afflicted may hear as clear as any, yet the brain's intricate machinery, that which separates the wheat from the chaff, the honey from the beeswax, malfunctions as if possessed by some spectral interference.\n\nThe origins of this disorder trace back to the mid-20th century, when researchers began to scour the minds of children with communicative impediments. In 1954, an Italian trio of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began crafting tests for these children, while in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception. A conference in 1977 served as a catalyst for further inquiry into this disorder, though its causes and a definitive diagnostic tool remain elusive.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are myriad, like the shadows cast by a full moon. The sufferer may be unable to pinpoint sound in space, to differentiate between simultaneous acoustic events, to recognize patterns, to detect changes in speech, or to sequence auditory information. The eerie silence of the afflicted is a stark contrast to the cacophony of the world around them.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD is a complex dance, requiring a systematic examination of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists employ various measures, including questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, and even recording acoustic signals within the ear. Yet, no single tool or test has emerged as a panacea, and the disorder's cause remains a mystery.",
            "In the realm of deception, Twelfth Night seems to whisper that while the cloak of disguise may serve as a shield to long concocted lies, it is but a fleeting sanctuary, for to remain hidden is to risk losing one's true self. Yet, the unmasking of such deceit presents its own perils, for one may find themselves cast adrift from those whom they hold dear. The question then becomes, is it better to preserve one's own identity at the cost of these relationships, or to discard the guise of falsehood and risk the wrath of those who have been deceived?\n\nIn the matter of gender role reversal, deception becomes a fraught issue, for it begs the question: Why does one feel compelled to shed their own skin and adopt the guise of another? In Viola's case, her motivation is clear: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). Having found herself in a foreign land, she feels the need to masquerade as a man to protect herself from the predations of men. Her plan bears fruit, yet it also isolates her from her fellow women, severing her from a vital support network. Her deception runs deeper still, as Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian, and finds herself besotted with Cesario.\n\nHer own romantic entanglements further complicate matters, as she grapples with suppressed desires for both her employer, Orsino, and Olivia. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261) It is through this web of deception that hidden emotions are brought to light, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. One might argue that these characters, through their interactions with Viola/Cesario, are forced to confront and acknowledge their subconscious desires.\n\nConsider Olivia's treatment of Cesario, who she first loves as a man, then as a sister, and finally as a beloved friend. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) It is as if Shakespeare, in his cleverness, is illustrating how deception can unveil the subconscious, much to the detriment of those involved. Perhaps Olivia's feelings for Cesario/Viola are not merely a result of Cesario's appearance, but a reflection of her own hidden desires.\n\nYet, one must not forget that Olivia's behavior is also a commentary on the mores of Shakepeare's time, where appearances held great sway. Her fickleness is a testament to this, as she switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, not out of malice, but out of a societal expectation to love and be loved based on appearance.",
            "The German colonial reign is oft noted for its harshness, particularly in its carnage of the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. Yet such a generalization pales in the face of the varied policies and governance that permeated their empire. The educational landscape, much like the geography, was a tapestry of differing hues. When the British assumed control of German East Africa, a literate populace awaited them. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational endeavors were praised by contemporary chroniclers. However, South West Africa (now Namibia) bore a stark dissimilarity.\n\nThe government, unlike in East Africa where it actively participated in education, deferred to missionary societies, providing them with meager sustenance. The European population, however, benefited from a robust system of state schools, nurtured and regulated by the colonial power. These policies cast long shadows, even after German rule receded. Unlike other colonies, where literate Africans abounded, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority remained untouched, unenlightened, and illiterate.\"\n\nA myriad of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This exploration seeks to delve into these factors, with a particular focus on the sentiments of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populace.\n\nA plethora of literature exists regarding education within the German colonial realm. Much of this is in German, penned during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works primarily chronicled the educational systems. Later writings, in English, expanded on this discourse through comparative studies and more nuanced analyses. These studies underscored the divergence in educational systems across colonies.\n\nCohen's study of South West Africa and East Africa is a notable exception. He compared the educational systems of the two colonies, attributing many of the distinctions to the large settler population in South West Africa.\n\nGeographically, South West Africa is a land of contrast; it boasts moderate climate, though much of it is barren desert. Its European populace, drawn to its relative comfort, numbered nearly 15,000 by 1913, compared to the scant 5,336 in the next most populous colony, East Africa.",
            "The taxonomy of Popular Music hath grown over the past one hundred years, encompassing a multitude of genres that defy exhaustive enumeration. Complicating matters further, most, if not all, genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, et al.—have spawned a veritable labyrinth of sub- and sub-sub-genres within their domains. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock, in particular, hath become a bastion of diversity and expression within the past four decades. It doth convey a broad spectrum of emotions, verging predominantly towards the darker recesses of the soul.\n\nThe origins of this genre, like a river carving its path through the earth, trace their lineage back to the psychedelic drug boom of the mid-seventies. This was an era where the boundaries between reality and the surreal were blurred, and the music that emerged reflected this state. The music of this time was wild, untamed, and otherworldly, driven by the scapegoat of drugs. The Romantic Era too cast its shadow upon later generations of metalheads, its dark, visceral qualities seeping into their songs like poison into the bloodstream.\n\nIn the realm of Heavy Metal, one need not look far to find lyrics that embody this darkness. Consider the following from Helter Skelter by the Beatles:\n\n\"When I take a trip on a rocket ship,\nIt's bound for a planet that's not the same as this one,\nIt's a place where the children cries and the food is all gone,\nBut when I'm there they call me a star.\"\n\nThis song, the dark and raucous response to a similarly heavy Rolling Stones tune, marks the debut of a new breed of music. The Beatles, spurred by the challenge of the Stones' heavier sound, sought to prove their mettle with this track, and in doing so, they birthed a movement—a dark and expressive force that would go on to spawn countless variations and sub-genres, a testament to the power of darkness and the human spirit.",
            "In the mists of time, long before the Surrealists' dreams were given form on canvas, there lived an artist who did much the same, albeit in his own peculiar fashion. Henri Rousseau, the man who would later be known as Le Douanier, spent his days crafting dreams—his own, and those of the world he sought to depict. The Dream, a piece from the annals of 1910, is not merely a vision of a woman entranced by a dreamt landscape, but also a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations and internal struggle.\n\nBorn on a May evening in Laval, a town in the northwest of France, Rousseau lived a life that echoed the rhythm of the seasons. His father was a man of humble means, a tinsmith and dealer in hardware, yet he was not without comfort. Young Henri, however, was not destined for the gilded halls of the art academies. Instead, he was groomed for the life of a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, a life he would lead until the age of forty. Yet, life, it seems, had other plans for Henri. A series of tragedies—first the death of his wife, then the loss of their eight children, and finally the birth of his only surviving child, Julia—left Rousseau yearning for solace in a new world. The brush, it seemed, was to be his salvation.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance, for recognition, is a tale as old as time itself, yet his path was uniquely his own. He was not educated in the ways of the masters, nor did he begin his artistic journey at the usual tender age. Instead, he painted as one who had much to say, yet little to say it with. His dream was to be accepted, to be recognised, to be seen not as the douanier, but as Henri Rousseau, the artist. Yet, to do so, he faced a dilemma that would haunt him throughout his career—a choice between the familiar path of mimicry and the path less traveled of authenticity.\n\nThe Dream, then, is not just a painting of a woman dreaming. It is a testament to Rousseau's struggle, a landscape of his own internal battle. Should he conform to the styles of his contemporaries, to the tastes of the critical world he so admired? Or should he forge his own path, allowing his unique vision to guide him? The choice was his to make, and make it he did, painting not for praise, but for the sake of his art.",
            "In the shadowed corners of thought, many a sage has whispered the intimate tangling of ethics and beauty, of truth and art. It is not for me to unravel this mystery, but rather to acknowledge it, to let it breathe in the quiet spaces between words. As Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our learning comes through instruction or trial, yet we seem drawn to the unspoken, the ineffable.\n\nEthics and aesthetics, they are both as much about describing as they are about prescribing. Our studies of morality and beauty, they are like the cartographer's map, showing us the paths but not the land itself. A conversation on the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might delve into perspective, hue, or cultural tapestry, yet these are but stepping stones on the river's bank. Often, we are left with a haunting echo, a \"just something about it\" that defies full capture.\n\nLiterature, it is like a whisper in the dark, a story that cannot be told but only experienced. As O'Connor mused, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" So too, ethics, it is a dance with the unknown, a song sung in the wind. It is this je ne sais quoi, this transcendental essence, that makes art and morality powerful, and binds them in a shared mystery.\n\nWe experience both morality and art at a level that is felt, but not fully known. This noumenal realm, it is where the heart beats, and the soul takes flight. Literature, it is the most intimate of the arts, for it speaks to our values, our truths. As McKean observed, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The Deutschland of today stands as a bastion of unity, a nation rooted in the looming shadows of the Alps in München, stretching to the Baltic coast of Kiel. The same indelible spirit echoes from the river Rhine's banks in Köln, through the heart of the country, and to the Elbe's embrace in Dresden. Such a vibrant culture, born of divergent sources and tribes, should not be surprising.\n\nGermania, the ancestral domain of the Germans, is shrouded in mysteries as deep as the Rhine. The origins of its name are a puzzle even the scholarship of centuries cannot resolve. Tacitus in his 98 AD treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" posits that the name came from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were once called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between his conquests, the Gauls, and the Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine. The word may hail from the Gaulish language, a shout from the battlefield, or the Old Irish \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicative of the Germans' war cries. Tacitus himself wrote that the Germans were \"aboriginal,\" unmingled by foreign blood, having arrived by ship rather than by land, drawn to \"wild country, inclement skies, sullen manners and aspect\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nThe Romans, with their sprawling empire, would dispatch legions to Germania for spoils and tribute, rarely venturing into the heart of the land. The Germanic tribes, however, found their place within the Roman ranks, their goods and skills traded for the might of the empire (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.).",
            "Downwards I gazed, mind unyielding and blank, drinking in the tableau before me. Unfeeling, unyielding, with a practiced detachment that refused to acknowledge the subject as anything more than a puzzle to be solved, my consciousness analyzed the scene laid out before my eyes. Thoughts flickered in and out, like shadows dancing on the walls of a cave, too ephemeral to grasp.\n\nOnce, I was given a book by an artist, a tome titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had yearned to capture the world around me since I was six, and this book promised to teach me the secrets of the mind's eye. It spoke of squares and lines, of how the brain interprets them, and of transforming complex scenes into simple, digestible images. Yet, that morning, as I stood before the bowl of fruit, I could not see the frame. I was overwhelmed, awestruck, as if I were confronted with the raw, unfiltered canvas of the world itself.\n\nPicasso's blues, Monet's greens, the Italian Renaissance's rainbow of colors - they were all paltry imitations of this... this... thing before me. If I were to attempt to call my own perspective \"Artistic,\" then this was the beginning of my masterpiece, the first stroke of my brush, the first page of my story, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nFingertips met the handle of my chosen instrument, muscles tensed and released, my will given shape as I moved. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Matter broke away, lost to the void. A second attempt, more anxious, more urgent, as my hand struck the handle again. The offending package refused to budge, stuck fast like a burr in the throat.\n\nMop in hand, feet planted firmly, tie knotted tight around my neck, I stared at the offending mass, a rude testament to the world's transience. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand reached for the wall, the sheet at the end of the toilet paper wrapping itself around my fingers like a shroud.",
            "In the grim tally of America's youngest drivers, a grim reaper's scythe cuts down more than a few. A confluence of factors weaves this macabre tapestry of youthful carnage. The National Institutes of Health whisper that the teen mind, in its nascent state, is not yet equipped for the perils of the open road. The simple inexperience of youth lies at the heart of this scourge. It is not merely the fatal accidents that plague these tender drivers, but also the heightened risk of rollover, speeding, and the abyssal plunge off the asphalt's edge.\n\nWhen these young souls journey with their peers, the danger is compounded tenfold. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center's sobering study reveals a stark correlation: the age of the passenger and the frequency of vehicular calamity. California and other states, in their wisdom, have enacted temporary provisional licenses, limiting the hours of teen driving and banning other minors as passengers. Yet, like a bandage over a festering wound, these measures are mere stopgaps.\n\nThe true malady lies in the collective ineptitude of the youngest drivers, as evidenced by the grim statistics. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even 18 is too tender an age for a license. A common tendency among those under 19 or 20 to court danger for the mere thrill of sensation only serves to exacerbate the problem. The thrill-seeker will not be weaned from the wheel until the tendency to seek such sensation has abated.\n\nIf we persist in granting driver's licenses to these youthful innocents, the death toll will not cease to rise, but will instead escalate into a grim procession. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' progeny will flood the highways, armed with licenses and a youthful insouciance.\n\nThe cure for this disease is not complex. Schools could continue their driver's education classes, but no teenager under 18 should be allowed to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could precede a full license, and a prescribed number of practical driving hours could still be mandated. The specific number of hours could mirror the majority of states' requirements, such as California's current 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. A uniform, national legislation would be a reasonable and effective means of safeguarding these young lives across the nation.",
            "In the dusty tomes of the Library of Congress, I found myself ensnared by the early Edison films, a collection of fifteen trick films from '85 to '01. These were not mere moving images, but illusions conjured by the alchemy of creative editing. My study of these films was a dance with the poetics that dominated most, and the outlier characteristics that flickered like embers in the later ones.\n\nAt the dawn of the twentieth century, the trick film was a creature of its time and bounds, bound by a frontal proscenium, immobile camera, and a rigid adherence to the one-shot rule. Yet, there were those that dared to defy these shackles, introducing multiple shots like a breath of rebellion.\n\nA common thread amongst these films was their setting: a stage within a frame, a theatre of the imagination. The camera, like a sentinel, stood firm, unmoving, its gaze fixed upon the action. A legacy of the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience's eyes were never meant to wander from the stage. Figures moved side-to-side, like cattle in a pen, never approaching or retreating from the eye of the camera. Witness, if you will, the dance of the actors in 'Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel' (1900), their movements confined to a horizontal plane, the camera their unyielding witness.\n\nThe shots themselves were long and medium, rare were the close-ups. A theatre tradition, where the audience's gaze was meant to embrace the whole tableau, never drawing close to the subject. The actors, like marionettes, remained in the middle distance, their faces never close enough to reveal their secrets.\n\nMost early trick films were constrained by the one-shot rule, their lengths limited to a minute or less. This was a limitation not of technology, but of storytelling. They were vaudeville acts, tricks and illusions, devoid of grand narratives. Yet, a single 'shot' could be a deception, a joining of several frames to create an apparition or a disappearance. Look closely at 'The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots' (1895), and you'll find the moment where Mary's severed 'head' begins, even as the film is, conceptually, one grand shot.",
            "In the desolate expanse of Caroline, John Taylor stood as an early and resolute advocate of Republicanism. Though he was first and foremost a man of the earth, his brief foray into politics and his life's work in agriculture had carved a man of unwavering dedication and unyielding voice in matters of personal liberty and governance. His conviction that the agrarian life was the highest calling shaped his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw in the young nation an opportunity to forge an ideal system, unhindered by native traditions that would cloud the minds of its creators. He believed in the natural rights of man, that they were interdependent and that denying one would diminish all, making them less valuable. These rights, he argued, should be beyond the reach of the government, for in his eyes, the state of nature was a brutal place where only the strong and cunning survived.\n\nTo create this utopia, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge the inherent good and evil within man. He was a rigid dualist, claiming that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, he defined, were those that protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government founded on such principles would function fairly, regardless of its administrators, who were inevitably driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was the root of all motivation, but only became evil when it transcended the creation of a society based on the public good, giving birth to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to harness man's natural evil, but it must be closely watched to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many of his fellow Republicans, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He advocated for a Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the document, for he knew that an extensive one was expensive and thus prone to despotism. However, he cautioned against a simple, literal interpretation, as it could easily become corrupt without reference to the intent of the writers. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, was the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to the chart, a precipitous decline in commuter log submissions occurred in the third month. This was a disheartening sight, and the cause is uncertain. As winter set in, bicycle and foot commuter numbers naturally dwindled, as did the campus population for the busy end-of-semester period. December's holiday bustle and subsequent break could account for some of the drop-off. Classes resumed late January, and the spring semester began, leading to a low February log count. The project's natural ebb and flow is also a factor, with an initial burst of enthusiasm followed by waning interest. To combat this, the Carpool Challenge Week was instituted in March, which saw an uptick in submissions. We faced the challenge of maintaining momentum despite holidays, semester breaks, and the deeply ingrained car culture. To incentivize alternative commuting, we offered gift certificates to local businesses. Larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, could have increased engagement further. The prize structure remained consistent, but increasing their value over time may have yielded better results. Initial gift cards seemed adequate, but announcing bicycles and hybrid/electric cars in December and January could have boosted participation.",
            "In the realm of finance, an ETF, or exchange traded fund, is akin to a creature of the market, forged to mirror an index, commodity, or basket of assets, yet possessing the fluidity of a stock upon the exchange. This beast grants you the breath of an index fund, while offering the singular ownership of a stock - the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and acquire as few as one share in a transaction. Yet, this creature bears a price, for the cost of entry is not merely the sum of its holdings, but the commission of the trade, much like the cost of a stock order. Moreover, the variety of funds available is as diverse as the stars in the night sky.\n\nBut heed, for the allure of these benefits must be tempered with scrutiny. A discerning investor should weigh the benefits against the reality, for the shadow of doubt lies ever in the darkness of the market. In this parable, we shall examine the ETF IHF and compare its top ten holdings, accounting for 63.58% of its assets, to determine if the benefits of holding a single ETF are as bountiful as those of a diversified portfolio of its constituent parts.\n\nTo gauge the efficacy of these holdings, we shall normalize the current percentage of assets to 100% and calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and return, should such a portfolio be composed entirely of these ten stocks in the proportions prescribed by the ETF. The results are recorded in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it is clear that a portfolio of merely the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. Moreover, the Beta of these ten holdings is 12% lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Yet, this disparity may be no more than a mere statistical quirk, a shadow play of the market.\n\nTo ascertain the veracity of this hypothesis, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare it to the accumulated standard deviation of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the realm of Edgar Allan Poe's literary domain, \"Dream-Land\" stands as an oft-claimed paragon of his poetic prowess. Within its mystic verses, Poe deploys the term \"Thulé,\" a relic dating back to Virgil's annals. Virgil, it is known, employed this term in reference to an isle beyond the known world, north of Britain. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, we must also acknowledge a more contemporary influence. Poe, you see, was a man of German literary persuasions.\n\nThis particular quote bears significance, for it bears witness to Poe's familiarity with the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his treatise \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between the two poets, concluding that Poe was not merely influenced, but outright imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe as a luminary in the realm of poetic drama, his magnum opus, \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808, the year of its inception, and the second, the year of Goethe's demise, 1832. Within the latter part, a short poem, \"The King of Thulé,\" is embedded in the verse. This poem recounts the tale of a king whose wife's demise, following the gift of a goblet, drives him to despair, eventually leading to his own end. The parallels between the king's plight and the speaker's journey in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, almost as if Poe channeled the spirit of Goethe's melancholy king.\n\nPoe, it seems, was drawn to this motif, referencing \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and employing the term as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" These two works, \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land,\" can be read as a pair, their themes of melancholy and despair intertwining like the lines of a poem.\n\nIn \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a land of perpetual twilight, haunted by the specters of lost friends, and bereft of color. These scenes, when compared to \"The King of Thule,\" reveal a mirroring of Goethe's own despair, a reflection of his grief and loss. The entire poem reads like a walk into the heart of Goethe's despair.\n\nGoethe, a writer of immense renown, would have been familiar to Poe, not only through his connection to Tennyson, but also through the many translations and reproductions of his works that circulated widely after his passing.",
            "In the cold, unforgiving light of California law, could a customer that was maimed after stumbling upon an applesauce spill in a grocer's establishment find solace in punitive damages, arguing that the store's manager acted with malice, given that he was apprised of the hazard twice and remained unmoved, engrossed in his evening repast for a half-hour?\n\nA judge is not likely to summarily turn away Jennifer Palmer's plea for punitive damages. To sway the scales of justice in her favor, she must present evidence of the manager's reckless disregard for the probability of harm. Palmer may assert that the manager should have known the peril of leaving a spill uncleaned, given the previous incidents that had befallen other patrons in the months prior to her mishap. While the argument that his actions were abhorrent may not be persuasive, it holds weight, given the six slip-and-fall incidents that befell the store in 2009, and his persistent inaction.\n\nOn the thirteenth of October, 2009, at the witching hour of five o'clock PM, an employee of D&D Markets informed his overseer, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in the aisle. Martin's response was curt, \"I'm on dinner break, can't deal with customer whines.\" At fifteen minutes past, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, sounded the alarm once more, and the manager's reply remained unchanged. At thirty minutes past, Jennifer Palmer, the unfortunate plaintiff, slipped and fell, her back shattered in the process. Five such incidents had befallen the store in the year prior. Palmer seeks recompense for her injuries, both compensatory and punitive, and we find ourselves at a crossroads, contemplating a motion for partial summary against her claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn the Golden State, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of contract, if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The law defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or if absent intent, it must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Conduct is deemed malicious when it is committed with a conscious disregard of the probable dangerous consequences, and the defendant willfully and deliberately fails to avert those consequences.

            "Four years removed, I encountered a course in Islam at CBC that stirred a heated debate on whether the faith is inherently hostile. The years since 9/11 have only deepened the relevance of this query. Once, a candidate with the moniker Borac Obama, hailing from a Muslim lineage, seemed unimaginable in the halls of power.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me, for it paints a Muhammad starkly at odds with history. From my understanding, the Prophet compelled conversions through conquest, seizing tribes and imposing Islam by force. Yet, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humbled, drawing converts one by one to his 'truth.'\n\nThe parallels between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles' are striking. The loaves and fish, multiplied to sate forty men, reflect a style that seeks not to prove, but to live in truth and wonder. This, I fear, is a usurpation, a theft of Christ's person and life, a theft that diminishes the divine.\n\nMoreover, the biography brims with 'witnesses,' stories told from afar, heard second-hand, third-hand, ad infinitum. This third-party perspective, I find, weakens the stories, casting doubt upon them.\n\nWhat galls me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad, to mold him into a gentle, humble, wise, and godly paragon. History, however, contradicts this portrayal. Can Muslims today see the true face of the man who rose to power?",
            "The teachings of the Nazarene, as they were hewn from his earthly sojourn, were soon lost to the avarice of men who followed. In the wake of his crucifixion, the faith they claimed to follow strayed far from the path he trod. The world, today, bears witness to an unyielding march towards enlightenment, while those who cling to the old ways may yet resist the tide. Among the faithful, a deepening understanding of their history will stir a yearning to strip away the accretions of time and return to the pure essence of the faith's origin. This reversal, though gradual, is inevitable, as if the hands of time themselves turn backward, until only the words of the man from Galilee remain, unadorned by the thoughts of others. When this current sweeps through the heartland of the world's mightiest nations, it will find its strength in the enduring institutions it will lead. Yet, the uniformity of belief that follows will be like the calm after a storm, as the diversity of thought returns to the simplicity of his teachings, for there is only one truth, and many paths to it. The great reversion is not without precedent. The empire that once despised the faith now bears its name, and a nation that once shackled in darkness now leads the way. This too shall pass, and the faith of the Nazarene will be reborn in a world that seeks his simplicity once more. And so, we must ask, what has been lost since his time?",
            "In the grim expanse of Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle,\" a stark reflection of our fallen nature is laid bare. The hearts of men, it seems, are hollowed out by a ceaseless hunger for power and wealth, heedless of those who labor beneath them. The grand factories, those behemoths of industry, stand as monuments to this insatiable greed, their owners and managers blind to the suffering they engender. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" Sinclair writes, \"here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" a choking, asphyxiating testament to their callous disregard for the world they despoil.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in their relentless machine, are treated as expendable, their pains and plight as irrelevant as the soot that clings to their bodies. Sinclair reveals, \"So from the top to the bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The owners, unencumbered by law or regulation, force their employees to toil in squalor, their backs bent under the yoke of unending labor. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers,\" Sinclair laments, his words cutting like a blade to the heart of the system that allows such misery to persist.\n\nAnd so, the workers are left to rot, their lives snuffed out like candles in the darkness of Packingtown, with no recourse, no hope, no escape from the despair that is their lot. Their only solace is the cold embrace of the grave, and the memory of the cold, hard truth that they were once alive, breathing, and free.",
            "In the grand tapestry of literature, each author weaves an intricate design to ensnare the reader's consciousness and tug at their heartstrings. Some, like F. Scott Fitzgerald, employ a linguistic alchemy, intermingling adjectives and nouns in unorthodox unions to cast a certain spell upon the reader. Fitzgerald's magnum opus, \"The Great Gatsby,\" is a veritable smorgasbord of such techniques. He imbues symbols with meaning, then wields them like a blade, cleaving the very fabric of reality.\n\nFitzgerald's chromatic symphony is a masterclass in evocation. White and gray, gold and green, red and pink, each hue is a note in his sonata of symbolism. The color white, for instance, is his scepter of uniformity, his banner of high station. In the novel's beginning, this color is ubiquitous. Daisy and Jordan are ever cloaked in white, a chaste shroud that belies their true nature. Nick, at Gatsby's resplendent parties, is a ghostly figure in white flannels. Even the mundane becomes resplendent in this color—Nick's journey to work is a descent into the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names on his timetable are as gray as the land of ashes.\n\nBut Fitzgerald does not merely paint with his colors; he uses them to signify, to underscore meaning. Daisy, after a prolonged absence from the white world, reemerges, \"dressed in white,\" a specter of her former self, a mere appendage to Gatsby's dream. The white roadster she drives is a ghostly apparition, a reminder of her past. Gray, too, is his tool, a veil of indifference. The \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" is a shroud, a barrier between her and the world. Even the dreary \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" are tainted with this pallid hue.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is not merely decorative; it is a language, a cipher that whispers secrets to the astute reader. It is a dance of light and shadow, a symphony of hue and tone. And in this dance, Fitzgerald leads us through the labyrinth of his novel, painting a portrait of a society where uniformity is a disease, and the color of one's skin is a badge of one's station.",
            "In the sun-baked heart of San Diego County, where the land yields abundantly to the kind touch of the sun and the gentle caress of the sea, the soil is not merely tilled but kissed into life. Here, the fields are a tapestry of green, woven with the threads of tomatoes, citrus, and leaves that whisper in the breeze. Squash and broccoli, herbs and berries, the sweet kiss of peaches and lemons, and the fiery dance of peppers - all grow here, nurtured by the mild, sun-kissed climate and the patient hands of farmers who tend to the earth like it were their own flesh.\n\nA market for such organic bounty stirs, a hunger that has birthed a community of growers who offer not just sustenance, but experience. Tours of their earthly sanctuaries, where the air is alive with the song of birds and the hum of bees, where the soil is rich with life and the spirit of the land. Here, the farmer finds not just a way to fill their pockets, but to fill their soul.\n\nYet, the path is not without its trials. The organic way, it seems, is a dance with hardship. The absence of chemicals is a burden, a calloused hand that needs constant care. Pests and weeds, they grow in the absence of poisons, and the soil, it demands a more intimate touch, a constant tending. The scale may be small, but the heart is wide, and the land, it gives back - in biodiversity, in joy, in spirit.\n\nThe parcel chosen, a testament to nature's resilience, is a patchwork of chaparral, exotic grasslands, and oak woodlands, nestled against the ancient heart of the Cleveland National Forest. It is a land that breathes, that lives, that is home to more than a hundred souls - some endangered, some declining, all precious. Here, the ghosts of the past whisper in the wind, the echoes of Native American feet and cattle hooves, the ghosts of cordwood sellers who once called this land theirs.\n\nThe land, it speaks of a heritage, a responsibility. It calls for more than just tending, more than just tilling. It calls for a partnership, a dance with nature, a symphony of life. And so, the farmer seeks not just the help of government, but the wisdom of the land, the spirit of the earth. For this is not just a farm, but a sanctuary, a testament to the power of the organic way, a call to arms for the future of the land.",
            "Culture, it is said, doth play a significant role in the dance of negotiation. One might define it as much by what it doth not encompass as by what it doth. It is not a homogenous beast, nor a singular thing, nor uniform in its form. Assertions such as \"all Russians are stubborn,\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are broad and simplistic, mere generalizations that serve to obscure rather than illuminate. A negotiator would be well-served to understand the import of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture's attitude may impact the table talks. When one approaches a foreign shore, one experiences it through the lens of their own culture, and comparisons, like the ghosts of old battles, are inevitable.\n\nTo understand a foreign culture or mindset, one must delve deep, like a miner seeking gold. It may involve poring over history, grappling with prejudices, or simply observing the patterns that unfold before one's eyes. Rather than judge or attempt to reshape, one must simply accept a culture for what it is, and work within its bounds, especially so when one finds oneself at the table with a weaker hand. And when on 'away' soil, respect for traditions and beliefs can be the key that unlocks the door to progress.\n\nCulture, it should be noted, is not confined to national or international borders. Within a given nation, companies forge their own cultures, each unique as a snowflake. Some may demand long hours, others a relaxed pace. Signs of corporate culture are visible in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some encourage philanthropy from any quarter, while others steer it to \"company-approved\" causes. The diversity of thought within American corporations, from coast to coast, is a testament to this. Some cultures may appear uniform to the outsider, but beneath the surface lies a world as complex and varied as the human heart.\n\nValues, too, are paramount. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company or superior to gain the upper hand. Conversely, a negotiator who hails from a culture that prizes a hard bargain will not settle for the first offer. A negotiator should be well-versed in these generalities before stepping into the arena. Yet, to truly make the negotiation effective, one must learn something of their opponent on a personal level. For it is not just the culture that shapes us, but the individuals who embody it.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" The words of Psalm 14 and the opening of St. Anselm's argument are but the first gust in the wind of theological inquiry. The same storm, one might say, bears Thomas Aquinas' words, who, like his predecessor, seeks to prove the existence of God. However, to compare their arguments, we must first accept that they both believe in the God of the Bible, for any other deity would muddy the waters of our discussion.\n\nSt. Anselm, in his Proslogion, suggests a path of self-discovery, a journey inward to find the divine. He argues that God's existence is inherent in our understanding, and thus, we cannot conceive of His non-existence. This is a faith-based logic, one that requires no empirical evidence, but rather, trusts in the truth that we already know within our souls. This is a common theme in Christianity, a belief that faith, not facts, is the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\n\nThomas Aquinas, however, treads a different path. He believes that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone. This approach, he argues, is beneficial for evangelism, as it allows one to persuade others through logic, rather than relying on their willingness to accept the unknown. His Five Ways are a demonstration of this logic: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument suggests that God's existence is a logical necessity, like knowing the piece of a puzzle that's missing, but its shape and existence can be known through the rest.\n\nIn both cases, we see a belief in God's existence, though the path to that belief is different, and neither provides a holistic basis for belief. For while faith and reason may lead us to God, they do not necessarily bring us to the same place, and perhaps, that's where the truth lies, in the journey, not just the destination.",
            "In the waning days of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born, latter to be known as Buddha. Over the span of his mortal existence, he left behind the trappings of the world and attained enlightenment, setting forth a path that would foster the birth of Buddhism - the most orthodox of which is Theravada. This faith, now some twenty-five hundred years old, bears little resemblance to its original form. Take, for instance, the island of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike partake in this ritual, a practice that Buddha himself never taught. Such variances extend from surface customs to the very essence of the religion. The Theravada community, both monastic and lay, has had to modify its doctrinal principles over time, a process shaped by forces both within and without, both friendly and malicious.\n\nI shall employ a few terms throughout this discourse. Internal forces are those born of the adherents of Buddhism, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or seek to harm the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces are those that neither wish to harm nor aid the community, though their actions may have unintended consequences.\n\nFirst, let us explore the fundamental tenets of this religion - the doctrines that lie at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Three Jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the essence of the Buddha's teachings, is comprised of the Tripitaka - the Three Baskets. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical components. The notion of Anatta - no self, Dukkha - inherent suffering, and Anicca - impermanence of all things - are central to this metaphysics. Only by acknowledging these truths can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Along with this, lobha - desire, dosa - hatred, and moha - delusion - will cease, and one shall become enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, for laymen and monks alike. Laymen adhere to five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not partake in intoxicants. Monks are bound by many more disciplinary rules. The most fundamental teaching is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha - life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "In the annals of world history, few rivalries burn with such fervency as the one that once engulfed the United States and Mexico, a feud that raged for fifty-seven long years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The apex of this enmity was reached during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States, like a hungry wolf, devoured the territories of Texas and the American Southwest, leaving Mexico bereft and humbled. In the interim, numerous skirmishes erupted between the two nations, not unlike the sparks that ignite a prairie fire, until the First World War finally extinguished the flames. (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThe seeds of this enmity were sown in the early days, when Americans and Mexicans clashed over matters of religion, culture, and tradition, as well as in the realm of material interests. It was a clash of ideals, a struggle for dominance, much like the ideological wars that have divided nations throughout history. The Americans, inheritors of the English way, and the Mexicans, heirs to the Spanish, were locked in a dance of distrust, a pas de deux of suspicion. (Frahm 2001 p. 86).\n\nThe list of disputes between Mexico and the United States, as chronicled by Diehl and Goerts (2000), is a testament to this enduring enmity. Seventeen grievances, each a chip in the armor of their shared border, each a testament to the constant skirmishes waged over territory. Bandits and outlaws, like ghostly specters, haunted the borders, their raids a constant reminder of the simmering conflict. (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nAs the years wore on, the tide of the rivalry turned. Mexico, once a proud, independent nation, became increasingly dependent on the United States, a new, more insidious form of occupation. And as American ambitions shifted, from territorial expansion to economic intervention, the rivalry began to wane, like a dying ember. (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I found myself felled by a malady I had never known, a shadow that descended upon me in the prime of my life. I had been a nurse, a profession chosen out of a desperation for the safety and certainty that had eluded me in my youth. \"Always work, always sickness,\" the words echoed through my adolescence and beyond, and so I forged ahead, even as my heart yearned for the realms of science and journalism. But fate had other plans, and at forty-six, I found myself crippled, alone, and penniless.\n\nThe world shifted beneath me, a storm that has raged for fifteen long years. I am a man adrift, clinging to Social Security Disability, a lifeline that has seen me through, yet left me bereft of anything truly my own. Each day is a battle, a test of my resolve, my security, my very self. Yet, there is one truth etched in these harsh years: I would not have endured were it not for the kindness of my family and a few steadfast friends. When calamity strikes, one cannot stand alone.\n\nEmergencies, they come in all shapes and sizes, and no preparations can guard against them all. We must learn to trust each other again, to lend a hand, to seek help when we need it. We cannot rely on a crumbling government to catch us when we fall. Our forefathers did not conquer the Rockies alone; they rode in wagon trains, united in their quest. And so, I say, be ready. But do not forget, as you gather your supplies and prepare your defenses, to open your heart to your neighbors.\n\nI have my disaster kit, my first aid, my water purifying tablets, and my plastic sheeting. I have flashlights and batteries, candles and matches, cans of food. I have a small farm and a wood stove, if the land and resources allow. But I also have a community, and I will not let it be forgotten.",
            "Why do creatures unfurl in this peculiar manner, as if governed by some unseen hand? Are there limitations or boundaries that dictate the course of their evolution? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson mused, \"Even now, the zoologist has barely begun to whisper in the language of mathematics the simplest organic shapes.\" Yet, here we stand, delving into the unknown, seeking to unravel the mechanisms that guide the transformation and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. Our investigation encompasses a fusion of mathematical modeling and experimental inquiry, a symphony of the theoretical and the tangible.\n\nWe employ X-radiographic images of Prunum species to pinpoint quantitative parameters, which are then fed into the software program CerioShell. Our models, like the shell itself, are a journey through 360 degrees of space, a spiral dance around the central axis known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls expand, the continuous line dividing each, the suture—these are the notes in our symphony, each one a whisper of the shell's story.\n\nThe shell, a testament to time and space, can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. In the usual orientation, the aperture points towards the viewer, and the apex, like a lighthouse, points skyward. The animal, a sailor in its shell, extends through an aperture, a window to the world outside.\n\nTo chart the course of the aperture, one must trace its path through time and space as the mollusk builds its shell. This trajectory, a graph of coordinates, can be mathematically represented, allowing us to vary parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The toll of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained stubbornly unchanged for a decade. As it approaches the end of the Millennium Development Goals, the nation's progress in water and sanitation far outpaces its advances in child and maternal health. The causes of this disparity are manifold, pointing to a need not for isolated interventions but for a fortification of the health system as a whole.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled workers, with 72% now meeting the target. Yet, this figure includes traditional midwives who lack the medical prowess to intervene in complicated pregnancies. Their inclusion skews the numbers, a stark reminder of the work yet to be done. Moreover, the rate of diarrheal cases treated by health professionals in children under five has dropped, and postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCaesarean section rates remain low, hovering around 4%, with urban areas performing significantly better than rural ones. This disparity underscores the inequitable distribution of healthcare services, heavily favoring urban areas. Additionally, the gap between the poorest and richest quintiles in service utilization is a staggering 27%, highlighting the financial barriers to healthcare for the impoverished.\n\nWith these issues in mind, the question arises: should Indonesia focus on targeted programmatic approaches or bolster the overall healthcare system? Programmatic interventions offer clear, manageable objectives and faster results. However, they have their drawbacks. Heavy investment in one area often starves others of funding and resources. Furthermore, the proliferation of uncoordinated, duplicative programs leads to an increase in administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature, with its meticulous attention to detail and abiding by the aristocratic norms of the era, is often constrained by a rigid adherence to tradition. Yet, amidst this rigid structure, two novels stand out: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works, like a lone wolf among the flock, embrace the strange and the untoward, employing a tincture of mystery and the bizarre that lends depth to their characters and insights into their motivations and emotions. Dickens, in Oliver Twist, captures this essence as he writes:\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels employ this mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though their function varies. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often unveil Oliver’s inner turmoil, his fears, and his awareness of the true nature of the events around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, he relives the experience as if in a dream, grappling for help. The passage underscores his lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as his dire physical state, reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbs all his senses, leaving him to experience his despair anew, unshocked by the pain, which now flows as constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. This lack of control over his fate forces the question: Whose will brought about his misfortune? For it was certainly not his own. The growing sense of defeat in Oliver is palpable, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, so that he can no longer react, even in the face of his own life.\n\n“And the day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.” (Dickens)",
            "A couple of years back, I found myself toiling as a tutor in an after-school program, helping young ones with their studies. My talents lay in the English and reading realms, yet I was roped into assisting a lad named Adrian, who was struggling mightily with his letters. The boy's predicament was peculiar. Some letters he'd pronounce as if he'd been born to the tongue, others he'd mangle like a drunken man. He hailed from a Latin household, but his English was as smooth as a river's flow. We wrestled with his struggles until fate intervened in the form of his mother, who swept into the room like a storm at sea. She spoke no English, only Spanish, and my grasp of the tongue was tenuous at best. We managed to communicate, though it was clumsy and stilted. And then it struck me like a thunderclap: the boy could read, but he was lost in the alphabet's maze.\n\nThis tale serves to illuminate the shadow cast by language barriers in our schools, particularly here in California. It's not always as clear as it seems. Even a child who speaks English like a native can be lost in the labyrinth of letters. We agree that this problem festers, so what's the remedy? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation, sufficed. Yet for those who barely speak the tongue, the solution is a tangled web.\n\nThe dual language system, a notion that's been given short shrift, could be a boon. It's not just for Spanish-speaking children, but for all. Research shows that those in such programs outperform their peers. Yet there's a fear that it's a waste of resources, that the majority will derive no benefit. This is a fallacy. If we integrated these programs into our classrooms, all children would reap the rewards. But how best to implement this? Should we insist on bilingual teachers? No, that's unrealistic. But having bilingual aides or tutors, that's something we could manage.",
            "From the moment we first draw breath, we are told there exists a force greater than ourselves, a void we cannot fathom. Some of us are instructed in its ways, while others turn to the temple or delve into the depths of their souls for answers. Many embrace the creeds passed down by those who came before, but some scoff at the notion, rejecting any notion of a world beyond our own egos. We traverse different paths, each seeking to define ourselves through our unique perceptions of the divine. We search for a guiding light to break the shadows that surround us.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" my father replied when I inquired about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the rain's relentless drumming on the tin roof accompanied by the steady rhythm of our cigarettes. The gutters gushed, extinguishing the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, his eyes reflecting an eternal search and a lingering memory. His once ample frame now hung loosely on him, his hair thinned and sparse. His gaze lingered on the rain, avoiding mine. I felt isolated, frightened, and unable to express the pain I would feel when he was gone, lest it become a reality for both of us. I embraced him tightly, moved my chair closer, and stared out into the June twilight's falling rain with him.\n\nIn December, five days after I reached the age of twenty-two, my father passed. The doctors' projections were bested only by the chemotherapy and radiation, which prolonged his suffering. What purpose it served, I could not comprehend. I lay in bed for three nights, curled into a ball and awaiting the news. No one telephoned.",
            "The so-called \"Gothic Novel,\" in essence a strange marriage of \"Old\" and \"New,\" as Ian Watt posits in his study, has been both reviled and revered, deemed shallow or profound, and celebrated for its capacity to evoke the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The first of such tales, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, fused the ancient and modern to birth the nascent Gothic mode, introducing a novel method of literary expression. Walpole, in his crafting of \"A Gothic Story,\" wove together old theatrical elements and new mimicry of nature, as seen in modern novels, to create a unique blend that would resonate through time. The Gothic genre, with its throwbacks to medieval theater, architecture, and tradition, baffled contemporaries, appearing archaic and unsophisticated in the face of modern societal and literary progress. Yet, it is this very fusion that allows Gothic to endure, forever new and obsolete to the displaced reader.\n\nChivalry, a cornerstone of Gothic fiction, is a prominent theme in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Walpole's work preserves and transforms the medieval ideal of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, reflecting his disillusionment with contemporary society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, Walpole romanticizes the past, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romanticism, as a means to aspire to a better present. Walpole, a man entangled in political turmoil and unfair accusations, may have felt the morality and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had vanished in his contemporaries. This is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits before our eyes ever meet him. His description includes phrases of a \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" a figure exaggerated, as is the Gothic tendency towards excess (66).",
            "The ceaseless dance of goods through the vast expanse of commerce, from the first whisper of a customer's desire to the final denouement of satisfaction, is what we know as supply chain management. Conceived in the crucible of 1982 by one Keith Oliver, a man of enterprise, it is the art of planning, executing, and guiding the ebb and flow of the supply chain to satisfy the customer's need with swift, efficient grace.\n\nSix are the cornerstones upon which this edifice is built: production, supply, inventory, location, conveyance, and knowledge. The manager, like the conductor of an orchestra, employs these elements to ensure the symphony of commerce plays to the customer's delight.\n\n**Production**, the first and foundational step, is the birthplace of the supply chain's essence. Here, the managers, as the midwives of industry, must discern the will of the market, the mother from whom all demands are born. The market, a vast, impersonal entity, tells us what the customer wants, and the manager, like a seer, deciphers its omens. Once the market's secrets are revealed, the manager decides what products shall be born and how many of them shall see the light of day. The where and how follow, with the manager choosing the plant that best serves the customer's needs, balancing volume and quality in the delicate dance of production.\n\nThe next key element, **supply**, is the strategic heart of the supply chain. Here, the manager decides the core capabilities of the facility and the paths of partnerships with others. For a single product, a company may have many divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the best division for each process, like a master selecting the most skilled artisans for a task. Outsourcing may be the manager's choice, to quicken the pace, to inject flexibility and reduce costs, or to maintain the low, steady hum of efficiency.",
            "In the grimy heart of Burma, a land where the junta's iron grip stifles the voice of the people, a lone figure stands, cardboard sign held aloft like a flag of defiance. The words scrawled in Sharpie are a stark reminder: \"Hitler lives.\" Burma, or Myanmar, a nation where the scent of violence and oppression hang heavy in the air, has a history of subjugation that echoes through the generations. The monks, their saffron robes a beacon of hope, took to the streets in 2007, their chants echoing through the empty halls of power. But the junta's response was swift and brutal, monasteries laid waste, journalists imprisoned, and a photojournalist named Kenji Nagai gunned down for the crime of bearing witness.\n\nThe world is not new to such atrocities. The Roman emperors, with their god-king pretenses, the Japanese emperors and their divine right to rule, even the current president, Bush, with his weekly communions with Ted Haggard, all share a common thread of absolute power and the suppression of dissent. The Tiananmen Square massacre, where the cries of freedom were silenced by tanks, the Rwandan genocide, where the river ran red with innocent blood, and Hitler's Third Reich, where the Holocaust's shadow still looms over Europe - these are but a few instances of humanity's darkest hour.\n\nThe sign, Ellen Page's sign, is a testament to the human spirit's refusal to be broken. It is a beacon of defiance in the face of tyranny, a spark that can ignite a flame. For the world is not new to darkness, but perhaps, through such acts of bravery, it can be made anew.",
            "In this brutal, unforgiving world of jazz, Duke Ellington carved out a legacy that endured like a ancient stone beneath the earth. He was a master of his craft, a damn near sage in the realm of sound. His fingers danced upon the keys of his piano, subtle as the whisper of wind through leaves, yet his compositions were as vast and intricate as the darkest nights under the New Orleans moon.\n\nEllington's genius lay in his ability to shape his orchestra much like a god shapes a world. The piano, his instrument, was a voice in this symphony of souls he conducted. He composed pieces that were rich and complex, each note a pebble in a river that flowed with the individual talents of his band members. He crafted a stage where soloists could improvise like the wild, untamed spirits of the South, yet he also wrote phrases and melodies that called for each player's unique voice. In doing so, he created a tone so distinct, so original, that it echoed across the decades.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, a tome of sacred knowledge, speaks of Ellington's sound and innovation. It mentions Creole Love Call, a piece wherein he used the human voice as a jazz instrument, adding texture and color without the burden of lyrics. This early experiment was but one of many examples of Ellington's ear for tone and his ability to complement the voices of his soloists. Creole Love Call, a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues, is a tapestry of call and response between voice and reeds, each chorus a dance of the soul. Chorus by chorus, Ellington weaves a spellbinding narrative, from the smooth, melodic opening to the rough, growling finish. The final chorus, a return to the first, sees the voice take on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument of the gods. It is a masterclass in tone, a symphony of sound.\n\nHot and Bothered, recorded the year following, finds Ellington combining his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing engage in a call and response, the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice creating a sound that is rich and complementary. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton introducing the melody on muted trombone, his sound as unique and haunting as a ghost in the night.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to his pieces is but one of the many stylistic traits that permeated his work. He was a composer of the highest order, a pioneer in the art of jazz. His legacy lives on, as eternal as the stars above the Mississippi delta.",
            "She'd always felt that something was missing, a void that gnawed at her, a yearning that refused to be sated. It began when she was barely fourteen, as she stumbled into the labyrinth of adolescence. Three years hence, at seventeen, she still sought, though her hunger had shifted from thing to person. Yet, no youth appealed to her, not even those who made their clumsy advances. She puzzled over this, her mind a whirlwind of theories and conjectures, each as fleeting as the morning dew. So she lived, and questioned, and waited.\n\nQuiet days at home, under the roof of her placid parents, were rare though she loved them well. Her father's calm demeanor, her mother's quiet fortitude, they never argued, not with each other, nor with their daughter. Except, perhaps, when she asserted her independence, her spirit wild as a stallion. Yet, she was their daughter, their beloved, her personality a beacon of light in their serene home.\n\nBut today was not one of those days. As she wandered the rooms, seeking some spark of inspiration for herself, she heard a cry, a wail that echoed through the house. It was her mother's voice, and it was filled with pain. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart pounding in her chest, her breath coming in short gasps. \"Mother? Mother, what is wrong?\" she cried out, her voice shaking.\n\nShe found her mother on the floor, writhing in agony, her breaths coming in short, sharp clips. \"Ow,\" she gasped, her voice barely audible. \"Sweet, take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter did not hesitate. She gathered her mother in her arms, her muscles straining under the weight, and carried her to the car. The drive was a blur, her mind filled with fear and worry, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nThe hospital was a place of antiseptic and suffering, a place of fear and pain. But she did not sense it, for her mind was occupied with her mother. She rushed her inside, her voice echoing through the halls as she called for help. Doctors and nurses swarmed around them, their faces etched with worry, and one of them gently guided her to a chair, leaving her to sit in anxious anticipation.\n\nIt turned out, her mother had fallen from a stool, trying to reach a vase in the highest cabinet. The vase was untouched, but her mother's body had taken the brunt of the fall.",
            "This study sought to illuminate the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as gauged by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", and the mitigation of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a variant of the Med diet, emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while deeming animal products and saturated fats as less desirable. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted within this regimen.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have established an inverse correlation between compliance with the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. In an intervention trial, the Med diet proved more effective than a low-fat diet in facilitating weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, these studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, between the ages of 38 and 63, who were free from cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes. Participants were drawn from the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses residing in 11 US states. Over the course of six assessments, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were deemed \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo account for random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to assess the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of both incident CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (both fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the year of Our Lord, two thousand and seven, the United States of America was beset by a calamitous financial crisis. Unemployment rose like a spectral tide, the housing market crumbled as if struck by a divine wrath, and many of her most vaunted corporations lay in ruin, their towers reduced to empty shells. This recession, a scourge upon the land, continues to this day, and we are compelled to inquire: how did this catastrophe come to pass, and how may we forestall its recurrence?\n\nThe roots of this calamity can be traced back to the Clinton administration, in the year of Our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, as the President sought to secure his reelection by pandering to the whims of the people. To this end, he relaxed lending restrictions, thus setting the stage for the sub-prime debacle that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes, a journalist of the New York Times, warned of the perils that lay ahead: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes, in his prescient wisdom, foresaw the consequences of their folly: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" Thus, the seeds of our doom were sown.\n\nThe crisis was not a singular event, but a confluence of many factors. Among them was the emergence of a new and labyrinthine mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) became the order of the day, ensnaring more and more sectors of the economy in the housing market's grasp. This led to a state of overextension, a kind of mania that left households and financial markets alike vulnerable to even the slightest fluctuations in price.\n\nThe housing bubble, like some monstrous beast, burst forth with devastating force. The investment banks that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left with a bitter taste in their mouths, for they were now confronted with debts in excess of four trillion dollars, accounting for nearly a third of our GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercially regulated entities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with their five trillion dollars in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September of two thousand and eight.",
            "Ah, the realm of exposition.  A place where some authors take flight with their quill, their words painting vivid images that captivate, or a place where readers' eyes glaze over and their fingers fleetingly hover over the \"Back\" button, cursing the author's name.  Dr. Merlin, she has known such a fate, standing before her monitor, her brow furrowed, her voice raised in exasperation at the excess of words, the overwhelming tide of information.\n\nExposition, it is not your friend.\n\nThe lesson, \"Show, don't tell,\" is well-known, yet it is a lesson that Dr. Merlin, she still struggles with.  Like a wayward horse, she finds herself atop a mountain of words, with naught but the silence of the desert and the echo of her own thoughts to meet her halfway.  The devil on her shoulder, it whispers, \"Get the story on its way, get to the meat of it.\"  But the devil on the other shoulder, it urges, \"Tell them every detail, every twist, every tear that makes up your characters.\"\n\nExposition, it is the simple telling of what has been, what is, what will be.  In the theater of words, it is the actor who takes the stage and spouts lines, the audience's eyes wide and ears alert, yet somehow, not fully engaged.  In the realm of fiction, it is the author who takes the pen and paints the picture, the canvas filled with details, yet the colors muted, the image blurry.\n\nConsider the tale of the heroine and her love.  You would not expect, in the telling of their story, that the author would spend two pages, their words flowing like a river, the lovers only getting two lines of speech.  You would expect, you would crave, the author to flesh out the man, to show him through his words, his actions, his very being, how he loved his wife.  And you would expect the same from the woman, to see her through his eyes, to understand the depth of their bond, the richness of their love.  You would mourn his death with her, and in doing so, you would grow closer to her, to her heart, her dreams, her very essence.\n\nIn short, you would expect more than just the simple tale.  \"They met, they married, he died.\"  A tale told too briefly, too plainly.  As a writer, you must provide more.  The bread, you must wrap it in meat, you must season it, you must let it rest.  You must let it become a feast, a symphony of words that captivates, that leaves the reader's heart aching, their soul yearning for more.  For that is the power of exposition, not to merely tell, but to weave a tapestry of words, a story that lives, that breathes, that is more than just words on a page.",
            "In the chill of a Columbus dawn, I bore witness to two broadcasts from the belly of the beast, the city's appetite for the grim spectacle of its own making. The first, an NBC forum, spewed forth its tidings with a certain lethargic urgency. A man named Shad Hostettler, his features etched with the malevolence of a thousand lost souls, had been taken for the murder of his wife, her name a whisper on the wind. Her blood, spilled in the quiet of Ashley, Ohio, was but a fleeting tale, a mere two minutes' respite from the day's unsavory offerings. The second, a tale of a youth named Travis Buyers, shot down in the cold embrace of Sharon Woods, was told with a certain reserve, the color of his skin a shadow over the truth.\n\nThe third tale, a bullet's footprint upon a Med-Flight's metal skin, spoke of a .22 caliber's song, a dance with death. Crime-Stoppers, with their five-thousand dollar reward, were the symphony's conductors, the dance's choreographers. The fourth, a teaser for the weekend's storm, was but a fleeting thought, a whisper of the weather's wrath. The fifth, a robbery on Clime Road, was a report of a dark-skinned man, a Hoodie's specter, a vulture's cry. His features were described with a certain relish, the color of his skin a stark detail, a curiosity.\n\nThe final tale was of a man named Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic drug kingpin, his sentence a curious thing, not twenty-five years, but three hundred months, a march of time. His hue, it seemed, was a detail to be noted, a curiosity, a whisper in the wind.",
            "A bond between brothers, a tether that cannot be sundered, a bond as immutable as the wilds of the world, unyielding in its grip. Within it, emotions swirl like a storm, a tempestuous dance of love and loathing, of pride and jealousy, of cruelty and compassion. Brothers, they see themselves in each other, a mirror reflection in the eyes of their kin. It is in the direst of times that this bond reveals its true face, both in its grace and its malevolence. The cost is high, the price exacted in actions and their aftermath. To see oneself in a brother is to see not as others see, but as one truly is. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers wade through a verdant, vivid landscape, a stage for their futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with fierce pride in their climactic encounter, and only one emerges alive. This theme unfurls through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's eyes, which convey the protagonist's complex feelings and their impact on his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's heart is a battleground, a landscape sculpted by a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fatal expedition, he feels a gnawing resentment towards Doodle. He sought a brother who could be his equal, one to share his world with, to race to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine's top fork. But Doodle's frail heart, a fragile thing, made such dreams impossible. The young boy's head filled with wild fantasies, crushed in an instant. He, even, contemplated death's cold embrace for his brother, a thought born of bitter frustration. Yet, a simple smile from the child could melt his heart, a hope that gave his conviction a moment's pause. Deep within, a love for his brother burned, a love that could not be extinguished.",
            "The human brain, a labyrinthine tapestry of thought and perception, has long been the subject of metaphor and inquiry, much like the ancient maps that once doubled for the unkown. Initially, it was likened to a simple wax tablet, plain and unchanging, yet it quickly evolved into the sprawling expanse of a parchment scroll, then the bound tomes of libraries, and now, the cold, unyielding circuit board of a machine.\n\nTo grasp the brain's enigma, consider the humble inputs of the senses, the eyes, ears, and fingertips that translate the world into electrochemical signals - a strange alchemy of flesh and fire. These signals are then woven through the brain's algorithms, a dance of bottom-up and top-down, where each step builds upon the last, like the scaffolding of a grand cathedral. The world is perceived, recognized, and understood, with the aid of the brain's attention, a fickle sentinel that guides our awareness through the tide of sensation.\n\nMemory, too, is a vast and mysterious landscape, where information is encoded, stored, and maintained in the brain's strange architecture. The types of memory are as varied as the grains of sand on a desert shore, from the fleeting moments of sensory memory, to the vast expanse of long-term memory, where information is held in the very structure of proteins, as if carved into the stone of the mind.\n\nMany are the models that seek to explain the brain's organization, from the human experience of memory retrieval, to the cold logic of computer science, and the dance of neurons. One such model, the semantic network, posits a web of nodes and links, where concepts are like stars in a constellated sky, connected by their relatedness, a web of meaning spun from the threads of thought.",
            "In the realm of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a dystopian landscape looms large, where the specter of technology and capitalistic structures intertwine to create a chilling tableau. The citizens of this world, born into a system that prioritizes community over the individual, are conditioned from the cradle to pursue immediate gratification. They are, in truth, mere pawns in a grand design orchestrated by the World Controller, a puppet master who tugs at the strings of their existence. Through the lens of Marxist critique, the author's suspicions are laid bare, as the story unfolds like a cautionary tale against the excesses of economic systems.\n\nCapitalism is laid bare in the novel's stark portrayal, where the Marxist concept of false consciousness prevails. The common folk, blinded by their own desires, are kept from understanding the true dynamics of their economic plight. Ideological control has rendered them slaves to their consumerist impulses, their wills subsumed into the machinery of capitalism. The conditioning they undergo, through hypnopædia, stokes the fires of consumption and indulgence, manipulated by the World Controller to maintain the status quo.\n\nThe notion of hegemony is evident in Huxley's vision, as the lower classes are kept in the dark about their own oppression. The Delta, Gamma, and Gamma classes, content in their stations, are merely cogs in a wheel, unaware of the manipulation that keeps them in their place. The upper classes, born with the ability to see beyond their stations, choose to remain silent, few exceptions like Bernard or other characters only serving to highlight the prevailing komplizen passive acceptance.\n\nHuman connections are as shallow as the novel's characters, each a carbon copy of the last. The lack of depth and complexity in their interactions mirrors the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism, robbing individuals of their free will and expression. Love, and the extremes of emotion, are absent, replaced by superficial interactions that reduce individuals to their physical attributes or fleeting encounters. This societal structure, a mirror of Marxist thought, reflects the proletariat's false sense of superiority, so long as they continue to consume, obey, and remain in the fold.",
            "I've been abiding amongst these hallowed halls for near on two and a half years now, a span of four and a half learning seasons. The sprawl of this campus, once a vast and uncharted territory, now feels as crowded as a cathedral during mass. The East Halls, where I was once sequestered, stand as a testament to the campus's relentless expansion, a relic of times when vast stretches of untamed land lay between the student and the heart of knowledge. Now, those same fields are filled with sports arenas, or the new Creamery and health services building, and the encroachment of apartments, all bearing down on the dwindling sanctuaries of quiet contemplation.\n\nIn times past, these expanses were traversed by the sure-footed and the intrepid, but as the campus grew, so too did the distance between the student and the classroom. The bicycle, once a symbol of freedom and simplicity, now appears a necessity, a means to navigate this ever-expanding labyrinth.\n\nI spoke to a fellow traveler, a comrade in this journey of academia, who had recently rediscovered the pleasures of the two-wheeled steed. \"Why did we ever stop?\" he mused, \"Bikes are the only way to traverse these distances.\" And he was right. The bicycle, a simple and efficient conveyance, carries one from one end of the campus to the other, as swiftly as the wind through the trees. A bowl of porridge and a few minutes of exertion can span a considerable distance. Yet, the path to the Thomas Building, a mere twenty-five-minute walk, becomes a mere five-minute jaunt on a bicycle, a saving of time that is both precious and necessary.\n\nYet, the road is not always kind. Pollock Road, the most direct path, is a treacherous one, a gauntlet of broken glass and potholes. And in the cold and the rain, the journey becomes a true test of endurance. But the alternatives, the alternatives of walking, are even more daunting. The thought of spending an extra half hour to an hour each day on foot, a total of more than two and a half hours each week, is a heavy burden to bear. The bicycle, despite its flaws, remains the swiftest and most reliable mode of transport.\n\nThe campus, in its ceaseless growth, must adapt to the needs of its inhabitants. The bicycle, a symbol of both simplicity and progress, must be embraced, not just for the sake of efficiency, but for the sake of the students themselves. For in this age of constant motion, to be still is to fall behind."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.

            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, I am drawn to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I intend to dedicate my life to the healing of children who have suffered abuse or neglect, and to offer support to families teetering on the precipice of ruin. The values that I bring to this endeavor are as follows: unyielding service, respect for the dignity of all, a steadfast commitment to ethical behavior, and an unwavering dedication to the improvement of relationships and my own professional growth. These are not merely professional ideals; they are the very bedrock of my being.\n\nSince my youth, I have been a beacon for those in need, though I was once uncertain of the path that would lead me to my true calling. In the hallowed halls of high school and college, I beheld many a soul retreating from their troubles in a futile dance with denial, and some who adopted coping mechanisms that were as twisted as the shadows they sought to escape. Witnessing such scenes, I chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Yet, even with this education, I was no closer to my true calling until that fateful summer, when I visited a friend and encountered a sixteen-year-old boy, trembling on her couch like a fawn in a storm. He had fled his home, seeking refuge from an abusive parent. The next day, I learned that he had called the police. I offered my assistance, and when the law could offer no solace, I sought the parents, hoping to shed light upon the darkness that had befallen their son. But their excuses were as thin as their nerve, their explanations for their actions as hollow as their hearts. That day, I began to see the path that was laid before me: a career in social work, a path that would lead me to the broken and abused, and offer them a beacon of hope in the darkness.\n\nBut beyond the pursuit of my own redemption, I am guided by a deeper call: the pursuit of social justice. Our society claims to hold the individual as sacred, yet we mourn them not for their uniqueness, but for their conformity to the mores of tradition. I am an individual, and I will not bind myself by the chains of societal expectation. From the halls of high school to the quadrilateral of college, I have stood against injustice, coloring my hair in hues that defied convention, dressing in clothing that reflected my true self, piercing my ears to the limit, and declaring my membership in the GSBA, fighting against the scourges of racism and discrimination wherever I found them. I am an advocate for social justice, and I will continue to stand against the tides of injustice that seek to drown us all.",
            "In these pages, we delve into the encroaching specter of insomnia, a blight that plagues both body and mind. We invoke two models to frame our understanding: the biological and the sociocultural. The former plumbs the depths of inherited traits and physical malaises, while the latter charts the tumultuous waters of environment and societal circumstances.\n\nInsomnia, a bugbear of the night, manifests in myriad forms. It is a primary disorder, a scourge of another mental affliction, or a by-product of medical ills or substance abuse. Dyssomnias, the primary disorders, include insomnia and hypersomnia, while parasomnias—behavioral or physiological anomalies—range from nightmare disorders to sleepwalking.\n\nOur focus is on insomnia, a shadow that hovers over consciousness, robbing it of rest. The biological model, a labyrinth of genes and physiology, reveals that neurons in the hypothalamus, bearing the orexin neuropeptide, govern slumber and wakefulness. Research with mice, those tiny sentinels of the night, uncovers that GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are the sentinels of sleep and wakefulness. Activated, they promote sleep; inhibited, they induce wakefulness. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep in mice, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for this receptor in humans. However, a flaw or absence thereof could render one a slave to sleeplessness, a curse that seeps into every aspect of life, from school to work, from focus to monotony.\n\nThe sociocultural model, meanwhile, examines the shackles of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. It posits that the very environment in which we are born and live can dictate our sleep patterns. A phenotype inherited from generations past could regulate our sleep, while an alteration in this receptor could disrupt it, casting a pall over our lives.\n\nBut remember, these are but models, frameworks to understand the labyrinthine nature of sleep. They illuminate aspects, but they do not dispel the darkness entirely. The journey into insomnia's heart is long and fraught with uncertainty. Yet, we must press on, for understanding lies not in the end, but in the path itself.",
            "The labyrinthine disorder known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or its less cumbersome sibling Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is the inefficiency and ineffectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes what we hear. Defined in its most stark terms, (C)AP is the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underpins this processing, culminating in those peculiar electrophysiologic auditory potentials. It is a condition in which the brain, that most enigmatic organ, fails to translate sound into meaningful perception. The afflicted may hear as clear as any, yet the brain's intricate machinery, that which separates the wheat from the chaff, the honey from the beeswax, malfunctions as if possessed by some spectral interference.\n\nThe origins of this disorder trace back to the mid-20th century, when researchers began to scour the minds of children with communicative impediments. In 1954, an Italian trio of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began crafting tests for these children, while in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception. A conference in 1977 served as a catalyst for further inquiry into this disorder, though its causes and a definitive diagnostic tool remain elusive.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are myriad, like the shadows cast by a full moon. The sufferer may be unable to pinpoint sound in space, to differentiate between simultaneous acoustic events, to recognize patterns, to detect changes in speech, or to sequence auditory information. The eerie silence of the afflicted is a stark contrast to the cacophony of the world around them.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD is a complex dance, requiring a systematic examination of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists employ various measures, including questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, and even recording acoustic signals within the ear. Yet, no single tool or test has emerged as a panacea, and the disorder's cause remains a mystery.",
            "In the realm of deception, Twelfth Night seems to whisper that while the cloak of disguise may serve as a shield to long concocted lies, it is but a fleeting sanctuary, for to remain hidden is to risk losing one's true self. Yet, the unmasking of such deceit presents its own perils, for one may find themselves cast adrift from those whom they hold dear. The question then becomes, is it better to preserve one's own identity at the cost of these relationships, or to discard the guise of falsehood and risk the wrath of those who have been deceived?\n\nIn the matter of gender role reversal, deception becomes a fraught issue, for it begs the question: Why does one feel compelled to shed their own skin and adopt the guise of another? In Viola's case, her motivation is clear: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). Having found herself in a foreign land, she feels the need to masquerade as a man to protect herself from the predations of men. Her plan bears fruit, yet it also isolates her from her fellow women, severing her from a vital support network. Her deception runs deeper still, as Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian, and finds herself besotted with Cesario.\n\nHer own romantic entanglements further complicate matters, as she grapples with suppressed desires for both her employer, Orsino, and Olivia. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261) It is through this web of deception that hidden emotions are brought to light, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. One might argue that these characters, through their interactions with Viola/Cesario, are forced to confront and acknowledge their subconscious desires.\n\nConsider Olivia's treatment of Cesario, who she first loves as a man, then as a sister, and finally as a beloved friend. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) It is as if Shakespeare, in his cleverness, is illustrating how deception can unveil the subconscious, much to the detriment of those involved. Perhaps Olivia's feelings for Cesario/Viola are not merely a result of Cesario's appearance, but a reflection of her own hidden desires.\n\nYet, one must not forget that Olivia's behavior is also a commentary on the mores of Shakepeare's time, where appearances held great sway. Her fickleness is a testament to this, as she switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, not out of malice, but out of a societal expectation to love and be loved based on appearance.",
            "The German colonial reign is oft noted for its harshness, particularly in its carnage of the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. Yet such a generalization pales in the face of the varied policies and governance that permeated their empire. The educational landscape, much like the geography, was a tapestry of differing hues. When the British assumed control of German East Africa, a literate populace awaited them. In Kamerun and other colonies, German educational endeavors were praised by contemporary chroniclers. However, South West Africa (now Namibia) bore a stark dissimilarity.\n\nThe government, unlike in East Africa where it actively participated in education, deferred to missionary societies, providing them with meager sustenance. The European population, however, benefited from a robust system of state schools, nurtured and regulated by the colonial power. These policies cast long shadows, even after German rule receded. Unlike other colonies, where literate Africans abounded, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority remained untouched, unenlightened, and illiterate.\"\n\nA myriad of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This exploration seeks to delve into these factors, with a particular focus on the sentiments of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native populace.\n\nA plethora of literature exists regarding education within the German colonial realm. Much of this is in German, penned during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works primarily chronicled the educational systems. Later writings, in English, expanded on this discourse through comparative studies and more nuanced analyses. These studies underscored the divergence in educational systems across colonies.\n\nCohen's study of South West Africa and East Africa is a notable exception. He compared the educational systems of the two colonies, attributing many of the distinctions to the large settler population in South West Africa.\n\nGeographically, South West Africa is a land of contrast; it boasts moderate climate, though much of it is barren desert. Its European populace, drawn to its relative comfort, numbered nearly 15,000 by 1913, compared to the scant 5,336 in the next most populous colony, East Africa.",
            "The taxonomy of Popular Music hath grown over the past one hundred years, encompassing a multitude of genres that defy exhaustive enumeration. Complicating matters further, most, if not all, genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, et al.—have spawned a veritable labyrinth of sub- and sub-sub-genres within their domains. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock, in particular, hath become a bastion of diversity and expression within the past four decades. It doth convey a broad spectrum of emotions, verging predominantly towards the darker recesses of the soul.\n\nThe origins of this genre, like a river carving its path through the earth, trace their lineage back to the psychedelic drug boom of the mid-seventies. This was an era where the boundaries between reality and the surreal were blurred, and the music that emerged reflected this state. The music of this time was wild, untamed, and otherworldly, driven by the scapegoat of drugs. The Romantic Era too cast its shadow upon later generations of metalheads, its dark, visceral qualities seeping into their songs like poison into the bloodstream.\n\nIn the realm of Heavy Metal, one need not look far to find lyrics that embody this darkness. Consider the following from Helter Skelter by the Beatles:\n\n\"When I take a trip on a rocket ship,\nIt's bound for a planet that's not the same as this one,\nIt's a place where the children cries and the food is all gone,\nBut when I'm there they call me a star.\"\n\nThis song, the dark and raucous response to a similarly heavy Rolling Stones tune, marks the debut of a new breed of music. The Beatles, spurred by the challenge of the Stones' heavier sound, sought to prove their mettle with this track, and in doing so, they birthed a movement—a dark and expressive force that would go on to spawn countless variations and sub-genres, a testament to the power of darkness and the human spirit.",
            "In the mists of time, long before the Surrealists' dreams were given form on canvas, there lived an artist who did much the same, albeit in his own peculiar fashion. Henri Rousseau, the man who would later be known as Le Douanier, spent his days crafting dreams—his own, and those of the world he sought to depict. The Dream, a piece from the annals of 1910, is not merely a vision of a woman entranced by a dreamt landscape, but also a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations and internal struggle.\n\nBorn on a May evening in Laval, a town in the northwest of France, Rousseau lived a life that echoed the rhythm of the seasons. His father was a man of humble means, a tinsmith and dealer in hardware, yet he was not without comfort. Young Henri, however, was not destined for the gilded halls of the art academies. Instead, he was groomed for the life of a gabelou, a municipal toll collector, a life he would lead until the age of forty. Yet, life, it seems, had other plans for Henri. A series of tragedies—first the death of his wife, then the loss of their eight children, and finally the birth of his only surviving child, Julia—left Rousseau yearning for solace in a new world. The brush, it seemed, was to be his salvation.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance, for recognition, is a tale as old as time itself, yet his path was uniquely his own. He was not educated in the ways of the masters, nor did he begin his artistic journey at the usual tender age. Instead, he painted as one who had much to say, yet little to say it with. His dream was to be accepted, to be recognised, to be seen not as the douanier, but as Henri Rousseau, the artist. Yet, to do so, he faced a dilemma that would haunt him throughout his career—a choice between the familiar path of mimicry and the path less traveled of authenticity.\n\nThe Dream, then, is not just a painting of a woman dreaming. It is a testament to Rousseau's struggle, a landscape of his own internal battle. Should he conform to the styles of his contemporaries, to the tastes of the critical world he so admired? Or should he forge his own path, allowing his unique vision to guide him? The choice was his to make, and make it he did, painting not for praise, but for the sake of his art.",
            "In the shadowed corners of thought, many a sage has whispered the intimate tangling of ethics and beauty, of truth and art. It is not for me to unravel this mystery, but rather to acknowledge it, to let it breathe in the quiet spaces between words. As Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our learning comes through instruction or trial, yet we seem drawn to the unspoken, the ineffable.\n\nEthics and aesthetics, they are both as much about describing as they are about prescribing. Our studies of morality and beauty, they are like the cartographer's map, showing us the paths but not the land itself. A conversation on the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might delve into perspective, hue, or cultural tapestry, yet these are but stepping stones on the river's bank. Often, we are left with a haunting echo, a \"just something about it\" that defies full capture.\n\nLiterature, it is like a whisper in the dark, a story that cannot be told but only experienced. As O'Connor mused, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" So too, ethics, it is a dance with the unknown, a song sung in the wind. It is this je ne sais quoi, this transcendental essence, that makes art and morality powerful, and binds them in a shared mystery.\n\nWe experience both morality and art at a level that is felt, but not fully known. This noumenal realm, it is where the heart beats, and the soul takes flight. Literature, it is the most intimate of the arts, for it speaks to our values, our truths. As McKean observed, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The Deutschland of today stands as a bastion of unity, a nation rooted in the looming shadows of the Alps in München, stretching to the Baltic coast of Kiel. The same indelible spirit echoes from the river Rhine's banks in Köln, through the heart of the country, and to the Elbe's embrace in Dresden. Such a vibrant culture, born of divergent sources and tribes, should not be surprising.\n\nGermania, the ancestral domain of the Germans, is shrouded in mysteries as deep as the Rhine. The origins of its name are a puzzle even the scholarship of centuries cannot resolve. Tacitus in his 98 AD treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" posits that the name came from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were once called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between his conquests, the Gauls, and the Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine. The word may hail from the Gaulish language, a shout from the battlefield, or the Old Irish \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicative of the Germans' war cries. Tacitus himself wrote that the Germans were \"aboriginal,\" unmingled by foreign blood, having arrived by ship rather than by land, drawn to \"wild country, inclement skies, sullen manners and aspect\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nThe Romans, with their sprawling empire, would dispatch legions to Germania for spoils and tribute, rarely venturing into the heart of the land. The Germanic tribes, however, found their place within the Roman ranks, their goods and skills traded for the might of the empire (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.).",
            "Downwards I gazed, mind unyielding and blank, drinking in the tableau before me. Unfeeling, unyielding, with a practiced detachment that refused to acknowledge the subject as anything more than a puzzle to be solved, my consciousness analyzed the scene laid out before my eyes. Thoughts flickered in and out, like shadows dancing on the walls of a cave, too ephemeral to grasp.\n\nOnce, I was given a book by an artist, a tome titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had yearned to capture the world around me since I was six, and this book promised to teach me the secrets of the mind's eye. It spoke of squares and lines, of how the brain interprets them, and of transforming complex scenes into simple, digestible images. Yet, that morning, as I stood before the bowl of fruit, I could not see the frame. I was overwhelmed, awestruck, as if I were confronted with the raw, unfiltered canvas of the world itself.\n\nPicasso's blues, Monet's greens, the Italian Renaissance's rainbow of colors - they were all paltry imitations of this... this... thing before me. If I were to attempt to call my own perspective \"Artistic,\" then this was the beginning of my masterpiece, the first stroke of my brush, the first page of my story, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nFingertips met the handle of my chosen instrument, muscles tensed and released, my will given shape as I moved. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Matter broke away, lost to the void. A second attempt, more anxious, more urgent, as my hand struck the handle again. The offending package refused to budge, stuck fast like a burr in the throat.\n\nMop in hand, feet planted firmly, tie knotted tight around my neck, I stared at the offending mass, a rude testament to the world's transience. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand reached for the wall, the sheet at the end of the toilet paper wrapping itself around my fingers like a shroud.",
            "In the grim tally of America's youngest drivers, a grim reaper's scythe cuts down more than a few. A confluence of factors weaves this macabre tapestry of youthful carnage. The National Institutes of Health whisper that the teen mind, in its nascent state, is not yet equipped for the perils of the open road. The simple inexperience of youth lies at the heart of this scourge. It is not merely the fatal accidents that plague these tender drivers, but also the heightened risk of rollover, speeding, and the abyssal plunge off the asphalt's edge.\n\nWhen these young souls journey with their peers, the danger is compounded tenfold. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center's sobering study reveals a stark correlation: the age of the passenger and the frequency of vehicular calamity. California and other states, in their wisdom, have enacted temporary provisional licenses, limiting the hours of teen driving and banning other minors as passengers. Yet, like a bandage over a festering wound, these measures are mere stopgaps.\n\nThe true malady lies in the collective ineptitude of the youngest drivers, as evidenced by the grim statistics. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even 18 is too tender an age for a license. A common tendency among those under 19 or 20 to court danger for the mere thrill of sensation only serves to exacerbate the problem. The thrill-seeker will not be weaned from the wheel until the tendency to seek such sensation has abated.\n\nIf we persist in granting driver's licenses to these youthful innocents, the death toll will not cease to rise, but will instead escalate into a grim procession. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' progeny will flood the highways, armed with licenses and a youthful insouciance.\n\nThe cure for this disease is not complex. Schools could continue their driver's education classes, but no teenager under 18 should be allowed to operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could precede a full license, and a prescribed number of practical driving hours could still be mandated. The specific number of hours could mirror the majority of states' requirements, such as California's current 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. A uniform, national legislation would be a reasonable and effective means of safeguarding these young lives across the nation.",
            "In the dusty tomes of the Library of Congress, I found myself ensnared by the early Edison films, a collection of fifteen trick films from '85 to '01. These were not mere moving images, but illusions conjured by the alchemy of creative editing. My study of these films was a dance with the poetics that dominated most, and the outlier characteristics that flickered like embers in the later ones.\n\nAt the dawn of the twentieth century, the trick film was a creature of its time and bounds, bound by a frontal proscenium, immobile camera, and a rigid adherence to the one-shot rule. Yet, there were those that dared to defy these shackles, introducing multiple shots like a breath of rebellion.\n\nA common thread amongst these films was their setting: a stage within a frame, a theatre of the imagination. The camera, like a sentinel, stood firm, unmoving, its gaze fixed upon the action. A legacy of the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience's eyes were never meant to wander from the stage. Figures moved side-to-side, like cattle in a pen, never approaching or retreating from the eye of the camera. Witness, if you will, the dance of the actors in 'Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel' (1900), their movements confined to a horizontal plane, the camera their unyielding witness.\n\nThe shots themselves were long and medium, rare were the close-ups. A theatre tradition, where the audience's gaze was meant to embrace the whole tableau, never drawing close to the subject. The actors, like marionettes, remained in the middle distance, their faces never close enough to reveal their secrets.\n\nMost early trick films were constrained by the one-shot rule, their lengths limited to a minute or less. This was a limitation not of technology, but of storytelling. They were vaudeville acts, tricks and illusions, devoid of grand narratives. Yet, a single 'shot' could be a deception, a joining of several frames to create an apparition or a disappearance. Look closely at 'The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots' (1895), and you'll find the moment where Mary's severed 'head' begins, even as the film is, conceptually, one grand shot.",
            "In the desolate expanse of Caroline, John Taylor stood as an early and resolute advocate of Republicanism. Though he was first and foremost a man of the earth, his brief foray into politics and his life's work in agriculture had carved a man of unwavering dedication and unyielding voice in matters of personal liberty and governance. His conviction that the agrarian life was the highest calling shaped his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw in the young nation an opportunity to forge an ideal system, unhindered by native traditions that would cloud the minds of its creators. He believed in the natural rights of man, that they were interdependent and that denying one would diminish all, making them less valuable. These rights, he argued, should be beyond the reach of the government, for in his eyes, the state of nature was a brutal place where only the strong and cunning survived.\n\nTo create this utopia, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge the inherent good and evil within man. He was a rigid dualist, claiming that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, he defined, were those that protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government founded on such principles would function fairly, regardless of its administrators, who were inevitably driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was the root of all motivation, but only became evil when it transcended the creation of a society based on the public good, giving birth to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others. A good government was necessary to harness man's natural evil, but it must be closely watched to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many of his fellow Republicans, called for a strict construction of the Constitution. He advocated for a Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the document, for he knew that an extensive one was expensive and thus prone to despotism. However, he cautioned against a simple, literal interpretation, as it could easily become corrupt without reference to the intent of the writers. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, was the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "Referring back to the chart, a precipitous decline in commuter log submissions occurred in the third month. This was a disheartening sight, and the cause is uncertain. As winter set in, bicycle and foot commuter numbers naturally dwindled, as did the campus population for the busy end-of-semester period. December's holiday bustle and subsequent break could account for some of the drop-off. Classes resumed late January, and the spring semester began, leading to a low February log count. The project's natural ebb and flow is also a factor, with an initial burst of enthusiasm followed by waning interest. To combat this, the Carpool Challenge Week was instituted in March, which saw an uptick in submissions. We faced the challenge of maintaining momentum despite holidays, semester breaks, and the deeply ingrained car culture. To incentivize alternative commuting, we offered gift certificates to local businesses. Larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, could have increased engagement further. The prize structure remained consistent, but increasing their value over time may have yielded better results. Initial gift cards seemed adequate, but announcing bicycles and hybrid/electric cars in December and January could have boosted participation.",
            "In the realm of finance, an ETF, or exchange traded fund, is akin to a creature of the market, forged to mirror an index, commodity, or basket of assets, yet possessing the fluidity of a stock upon the exchange. This beast grants you the breath of an index fund, while offering the singular ownership of a stock - the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and acquire as few as one share in a transaction. Yet, this creature bears a price, for the cost of entry is not merely the sum of its holdings, but the commission of the trade, much like the cost of a stock order. Moreover, the variety of funds available is as diverse as the stars in the night sky.\n\nBut heed, for the allure of these benefits must be tempered with scrutiny. A discerning investor should weigh the benefits against the reality, for the shadow of doubt lies ever in the darkness of the market. In this parable, we shall examine the ETF IHF and compare its top ten holdings, accounting for 63.58% of its assets, to determine if the benefits of holding a single ETF are as bountiful as those of a diversified portfolio of its constituent parts.\n\nTo gauge the efficacy of these holdings, we shall normalize the current percentage of assets to 100% and calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and return, should such a portfolio be composed entirely of these ten stocks in the proportions prescribed by the ETF. The results are recorded in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it is clear that a portfolio of merely the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. Moreover, the Beta of these ten holdings is 12% lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Yet, this disparity may be no more than a mere statistical quirk, a shadow play of the market.\n\nTo ascertain the veracity of this hypothesis, we shall calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare it to the accumulated standard deviation of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the realm of Edgar Allan Poe's literary domain, \"Dream-Land\" stands as an oft-claimed paragon of his poetic prowess. Within its mystic verses, Poe deploys the term \"Thulé,\" a relic dating back to Virgil's annals. Virgil, it is known, employed this term in reference to an isle beyond the known world, north of Britain. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, we must also acknowledge a more contemporary influence. Poe, you see, was a man of German literary persuasions.\n\nThis particular quote bears significance, for it bears witness to Poe's familiarity with the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his treatise \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between the two poets, concluding that Poe was not merely influenced, but outright imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe as a luminary in the realm of poetic drama, his magnum opus, \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808, the year of its inception, and the second, the year of Goethe's demise, 1832. Within the latter part, a short poem, \"The King of Thulé,\" is embedded in the verse. This poem recounts the tale of a king whose wife's demise, following the gift of a goblet, drives him to despair, eventually leading to his own end. The parallels between the king's plight and the speaker's journey in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, almost as if Poe channeled the spirit of Goethe's melancholy king.\n\nPoe, it seems, was drawn to this motif, referencing \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and employing the term as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" These two works, \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land,\" can be read as a pair, their themes of melancholy and despair intertwining like the lines of a poem.\n\nIn \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a land of perpetual twilight, haunted by the specters of lost friends, and bereft of color. These scenes, when compared to \"The King of Thule,\" reveal a mirroring of Goethe's own despair, a reflection of his grief and loss. The entire poem reads like a walk into the heart of Goethe's despair.\n\nGoethe, a writer of immense renown, would have been familiar to Poe, not only through his connection to Tennyson, but also through the many translations and reproductions of his works that circulated widely after his passing.",
            "In the cold, unforgiving light of California law, could a customer that was maimed after stumbling upon an applesauce spill in a grocer's establishment find solace in punitive damages, arguing that the store's manager acted with malice, given that he was apprised of the hazard twice and remained unmoved, engrossed in his evening repast for a half-hour?\n\nA judge is not likely to summarily turn away Jennifer Palmer's plea for punitive damages. To sway the scales of justice in her favor, she must present evidence of the manager's reckless disregard for the probability of harm. Palmer may assert that the manager should have known the peril of leaving a spill uncleaned, given the previous incidents that had befallen other patrons in the months prior to her mishap. While the argument that his actions were abhorrent may not be persuasive, it holds weight, given the six slip-and-fall incidents that befell the store in 2009, and his persistent inaction.\n\nOn the thirteenth of October, 2009, at the witching hour of five o'clock PM, an employee of D&D Markets informed his overseer, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in the aisle. Martin's response was curt, \"I'm on dinner break, can't deal with customer whines.\" At fifteen minutes past, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, sounded the alarm once more, and the manager's reply remained unchanged. At thirty minutes past, Jennifer Palmer, the unfortunate plaintiff, slipped and fell, her back shattered in the process. Five such incidents had befallen the store in the year prior. Palmer seeks recompense for her injuries, both compensatory and punitive, and we find ourselves at a crossroads, contemplating a motion for partial summary against her claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn the Golden State, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of contract, if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The law defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or if absent intent, it must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Conduct is deemed malicious when it is committed with a conscious disregard of the probable dangerous consequences, and the defendant willfully and deliberately fails to avert those consequences.

            "Four years removed, I encountered a course in Islam at CBC that stirred a heated debate on whether the faith is inherently hostile. The years since 9/11 have only deepened the relevance of this query. Once, a candidate with the moniker Borac Obama, hailing from a Muslim lineage, seemed unimaginable in the halls of power.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me, for it paints a Muhammad starkly at odds with history. From my understanding, the Prophet compelled conversions through conquest, seizing tribes and imposing Islam by force. Yet, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humbled, drawing converts one by one to his 'truth.'\n\nThe parallels between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles' are striking. The loaves and fish, multiplied to sate forty men, reflect a style that seeks not to prove, but to live in truth and wonder. This, I fear, is a usurpation, a theft of Christ's person and life, a theft that diminishes the divine.\n\nMoreover, the biography brims with 'witnesses,' stories told from afar, heard second-hand, third-hand, ad infinitum. This third-party perspective, I find, weakens the stories, casting doubt upon them.\n\nWhat galls me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad, to mold him into a gentle, humble, wise, and godly paragon. History, however, contradicts this portrayal. Can Muslims today see the true face of the man who rose to power?",

In the wake of his crucifixion, the faith they claimed to follow strayed far from the path he trod. The world, today, bears witness to an unyielding march towards enlightenment, while those who cling to the old ways may yet resist the tide. Among the faithful, a deepening understanding of their history will stir a yearning to strip away the accretions of time and return to the pure essence of the faith's origin. This reversal, though gradual, is inevitable, as if the hands of time themselves turn backward, until only the words of the man from Galilee remain, unadorned by the thoughts of others. When this current sweeps through the heartland of the world's mightiest nations, it will find its strength in the enduring institutions it will lead. Yet, the uniformity of belief that follows will be like the calm after a storm, as the diversity of thought returns to the simplicity of his teachings, for there is only one truth, and many paths to it. The great reversion is not without precedent. The empire that once despised the faith now bears its name, and a nation that once shackled in darkness now leads the way. This too shall pass, and the faith of the Nazarene will be reborn in a world that seeks his simplicity once more. And so, we must ask, what has been lost since his time?",
            "In the grim expanse of Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle,\" a stark reflection of our fallen nature is laid bare. The hearts of men, it seems, are hollowed out by a ceaseless hunger for power and wealth, heedless of those who labor beneath them. The grand factories, those behemoths of industry, stand as monuments to this insatiable greed, their owners and managers blind to the suffering they engender. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" Sinclair writes, \"here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" a choking, asphyxiating testament to their callous disregard for the world they despoil.\n\nThe workers, mere cogs in their relentless machine, are treated as expendable, their pains and plight as irrelevant as the soot that clings to their bodies. Sinclair reveals, \"So from the top to the bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The owners, unencumbered by law or regulation, force their employees to toil in squalor, their backs bent under the yoke of unending labor. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers,\" Sinclair laments, his words cutting like a blade to the heart of the system that allows such misery to persist.\n\nAnd so, the workers are left to rot, their lives snuffed out like candles in the darkness of Packingtown, with no recourse, no hope, no escape from the despair that is their lot. Their only solace is the cold embrace of the grave, and the memory of the cold, hard truth that they were once alive, breathing, and free.",
            "In the grand tapestry of literature, each author weaves an intricate design to ensnare the reader's consciousness and tug at their heartstrings. Some, like F. Scott Fitzgerald, employ a linguistic alchemy, intermingling adjectives and nouns in unorthodox unions to cast a certain spell upon the reader. Fitzgerald's magnum opus, \"The Great Gatsby,\" is a veritable smorgasbord of such techniques. He imbues symbols with meaning, then wields them like a blade, cleaving the very fabric of reality.\n\nFitzgerald's chromatic symphony is a masterclass in evocation. White and gray, gold and green, red and pink, each hue is a note in his sonata of symbolism. The color white, for instance, is his scepter of uniformity, his banner of high station. In the novel's beginning, this color is ubiquitous. Daisy and Jordan are ever cloaked in white, a chaste shroud that belies their true nature. Nick, at Gatsby's resplendent parties, is a ghostly figure in white flannels. Even the mundane becomes resplendent in this color—Nick's journey to work is a descent into the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names on his timetable are as gray as the land of ashes.\n\nBut Fitzgerald does not merely paint with his colors; he uses them to signify, to underscore meaning. Daisy, after a prolonged absence from the white world, reemerges, \"dressed in white,\" a specter of her former self, a mere appendage to Gatsby's dream. The white roadster she drives is a ghostly apparition, a reminder of her past. Gray, too, is his tool, a veil of indifference. The \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" is a shroud, a barrier between her and the world. Even the dreary \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" are tainted with this pallid hue.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color is not merely decorative; it is a language, a cipher that whispers secrets to the astute reader. It is a dance of light and shadow, a symphony of hue and tone. And in this dance, Fitzgerald leads us through the labyrinth of his novel, painting a portrait of a society where uniformity is a disease, and the color of one's skin is a badge of one's station.",
            "In the sun-baked heart of San Diego County, where the land yields abundantly to the kind touch of the sun and the gentle caress of the sea, the soil is not merely tilled but kissed into life. Here, the fields are a tapestry of green, woven with the threads of tomatoes, citrus, and leaves that whisper in the breeze. Squash and broccoli, herbs and berries, the sweet kiss of peaches and lemons, and the fiery dance of peppers - all grow here, nurtured by the mild, sun-kissed climate and the patient hands of farmers who tend to the earth like it were their own flesh.\n\nA market for such organic bounty stirs, a hunger that has birthed a community of growers who offer not just sustenance, but experience. Tours of their earthly sanctuaries, where the air is alive with the song of birds and the hum of bees, where the soil is rich with life and the spirit of the land. Here, the farmer finds not just a way to fill their pockets, but to fill their soul.\n\nYet, the path is not without its trials. The organic way, it seems, is a dance with hardship. The absence of chemicals is a burden, a calloused hand that needs constant care. Pests and weeds, they grow in the absence of poisons, and the soil, it demands a more intimate touch, a constant tending. The scale may be small, but the heart is wide, and the land, it gives back - in biodiversity, in joy, in spirit.\n\nThe parcel chosen, a testament to nature's resilience, is a patchwork of chaparral, exotic grasslands, and oak woodlands, nestled against the ancient heart of the Cleveland National Forest. It is a land that breathes, that lives, that is home to more than a hundred souls - some endangered, some declining, all precious. Here, the ghosts of the past whisper in the wind, the echoes of Native American feet and cattle hooves, the ghosts of cordwood sellers who once called this land theirs.\n\nThe land, it speaks of a heritage, a responsibility. It calls for more than just tending, more than just tilling. It calls for a partnership, a dance with nature, a symphony of life. And so, the farmer seeks not just the help of government, but the wisdom of the land, the spirit of the earth. For this is not just a farm, but a sanctuary, a testament to the power of the organic way, a call to arms for the future of the land.",
            "Culture, it is said, doth play a significant role in the dance of negotiation. One might define it as much by what it doth not encompass as by what it doth. It is not a homogenous beast, nor a singular thing, nor uniform in its form. Assertions such as \"all Russians are stubborn,\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are broad and simplistic, mere generalizations that serve to obscure rather than illuminate. A negotiator would be well-served to understand the import of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture's attitude may impact the table talks. When one approaches a foreign shore, one experiences it through the lens of their own culture, and comparisons, like the ghosts of old battles, are inevitable.\n\nTo understand a foreign culture or mindset, one must delve deep, like a miner seeking gold. It may involve poring over history, grappling with prejudices, or simply observing the patterns that unfold before one's eyes. Rather than judge or attempt to reshape, one must simply accept a culture for what it is, and work within its bounds, especially so when one finds oneself at the table with a weaker hand. And when on 'away' soil, respect for traditions and beliefs can be the key that unlocks the door to progress.\n\nCulture, it should be noted, is not confined to national or international borders. Within a given nation, companies forge their own cultures, each unique as a snowflake. Some may demand long hours, others a relaxed pace. Signs of corporate culture are visible in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some encourage philanthropy from any quarter, while others steer it to \"company-approved\" causes. The diversity of thought within American corporations, from coast to coast, is a testament to this. Some cultures may appear uniform to the outsider, but beneath the surface lies a world as complex and varied as the human heart.\n\nValues, too, are paramount. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will not shame his company or superior to gain the upper hand. Conversely, a negotiator who hails from a culture that prizes a hard bargain will not settle for the first offer. A negotiator should be well-versed in these generalities before stepping into the arena. Yet, to truly make the negotiation effective, one must learn something of their opponent on a personal level. For it is not just the culture that shapes us, but the individuals who embody it.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" The words of Psalm 14 and the opening of St. Anselm's argument are but the first gust in the wind of theological inquiry. The same storm, one might say, bears Thomas Aquinas' words, who, like his predecessor, seeks to prove the existence of God. However, to compare their arguments, we must first accept that they both believe in the God of the Bible, for any other deity would muddy the waters of our discussion.\n\nSt. Anselm, in his Proslogion, suggests a path of self-discovery, a journey inward to find the divine. He argues that God's existence is inherent in our understanding, and thus, we cannot conceive of His non-existence. This is a faith-based logic, one that requires no empirical evidence, but rather, trusts in the truth that we already know within our souls. This is a common theme in Christianity, a belief that faith, not facts, is the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\n\nThomas Aquinas, however, treads a different path. He believes that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone. This approach, he argues, is beneficial for evangelism, as it allows one to persuade others through logic, rather than relying on their willingness to accept the unknown. His Five Ways are a demonstration of this logic: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument suggests that God's existence is a logical necessity, like knowing the piece of a puzzle that's missing, but its shape and existence can be known through the rest.\n\nIn both cases, we see a belief in God's existence, though the path to that belief is different, and neither provides a holistic basis for belief. For while faith and reason may lead us to God, they do not necessarily bring us to the same place, and perhaps, that's where the truth lies, in the journey, not just the destination.",
            "In the waning days of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born, latter to be known as Buddha. Over the span of his mortal existence, he left behind the trappings of the world and attained enlightenment, setting forth a path that would foster the birth of Buddhism - the most orthodox of which is Theravada. This faith, now some twenty-five hundred years old, bears little resemblance to its original form. Take, for instance, the island of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike partake in this ritual, a practice that Buddha himself never taught. Such variances extend from surface customs to the very essence of the religion. The Theravada community, both monastic and lay, has had to modify its doctrinal principles over time, a process shaped by forces both within and without, both friendly and malicious.\n\nI shall employ a few terms throughout this discourse. Internal forces are those born of the adherents of Buddhism, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or seek to harm the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces are those that neither wish to harm nor aid the community, though their actions may have unintended consequences.\n\nFirst, let us explore the fundamental tenets of this religion - the doctrines that lie at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Three Jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the essence of the Buddha's teachings, is comprised of the Tripitaka - the Three Baskets. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka the metaphysical components. The notion of Anatta - no self, Dukkha - inherent suffering, and Anicca - impermanence of all things - are central to this metaphysics. Only by acknowledging these truths can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Along with this, lobha - desire, dosa - hatred, and moha - delusion - will cease, and one shall become enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, for laymen and monks alike. Laymen adhere to five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not partake in intoxicants. Monks are bound by many more disciplinary rules. The most fundamental teaching is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha - life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "In the annals of world history, few rivalries burn with such fervency as the one that once engulfed the United States and Mexico, a feud that raged for fifty-seven long years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The apex of this enmity was reached during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States, like a hungry wolf, devoured the territories of Texas and the American Southwest, leaving Mexico bereft and humbled. In the interim, numerous skirmishes erupted between the two nations, not unlike the sparks that ignite a prairie fire, until the First World War finally extinguished the flames. (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThe seeds of this enmity were sown in the early days, when Americans and Mexicans clashed over matters of religion, culture, and tradition, as well as in the realm of material interests. It was a clash of ideals, a struggle for dominance, much like the ideological wars that have divided nations throughout history. The Americans, inheritors of the English way, and the Mexicans, heirs to the Spanish, were locked in a dance of distrust, a pas de deux of suspicion. (Frahm 2001 p. 86).\n\nThe list of disputes between Mexico and the United States, as chronicled by Diehl and Goerts (2000), is a testament to this enduring enmity. Seventeen grievances, each a chip in the armor of their shared border, each a testament to the constant skirmishes waged over territory. Bandits and outlaws, like ghostly specters, haunted the borders, their raids a constant reminder of the simmering conflict. (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nAs the years wore on, the tide of the rivalry turned. Mexico, once a proud, independent nation, became increasingly dependent on the United States, a new, more insidious form of occupation. And as American ambitions shifted, from territorial expansion to economic intervention, the rivalry began to wane, like a dying ember. (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I found myself felled by a malady I had never known, a shadow that descended upon me in the prime of my life. I had been a nurse, a profession chosen out of a desperation for the safety and certainty that had eluded me in my youth. \"Always work, always sickness,\" the words echoed through my adolescence and beyond, and so I forged ahead, even as my heart yearned for the realms of science and journalism. But fate had other plans, and at forty-six, I found myself crippled, alone, and penniless.\n\nThe world shifted beneath me, a storm that has raged for fifteen long years. I am a man adrift, clinging to Social Security Disability, a lifeline that has seen me through, yet left me bereft of anything truly my own. Each day is a battle, a test of my resolve, my security, my very self. Yet, there is one truth etched in these harsh years: I would not have endured were it not for the kindness of my family and a few steadfast friends. When calamity strikes, one cannot stand alone.\n\nEmergencies, they come in all shapes and sizes, and no preparations can guard against them all. We must learn to trust each other again, to lend a hand, to seek help when we need it. We cannot rely on a crumbling government to catch us when we fall. Our forefathers did not conquer the Rockies alone; they rode in wagon trains, united in their quest. And so, I say, be ready. But do not forget, as you gather your supplies and prepare your defenses, to open your heart to your neighbors.\n\nI have my disaster kit, my first aid, my water purifying tablets, and my plastic sheeting. I have flashlights and batteries, candles and matches, cans of food. I have a small farm and a wood stove, if the land and resources allow. But I also have a community, and I will not let it be forgotten.",
            "Why do creatures unfurl in this peculiar manner, as if governed by some unseen hand? Are there limitations or boundaries that dictate the course of their evolution? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson mused, \"Even now, the zoologist has barely begun to whisper in the language of mathematics the simplest organic shapes.\" Yet, here we stand, delving into the unknown, seeking to unravel the mechanisms that guide the transformation and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. Our investigation encompasses a fusion of mathematical modeling and experimental inquiry, a symphony of the theoretical and the tangible.\n\nWe employ X-radiographic images of Prunum species to pinpoint quantitative parameters, which are then fed into the software program CerioShell. Our models, like the shell itself, are a journey through 360 degrees of space, a spiral dance around the central axis known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls expand, the continuous line dividing each, the suture—these are the notes in our symphony, each one a whisper of the shell's story.\n\nThe shell, a testament to time and space, can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. In the usual orientation, the aperture points towards the viewer, and the apex, like a lighthouse, points skyward. The animal, a sailor in its shell, extends through an aperture, a window to the world outside.\n\nTo chart the course of the aperture, one must trace its path through time and space as the mollusk builds its shell. This trajectory, a graph of coordinates, can be mathematically represented, allowing us to vary parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The toll of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained stubbornly unchanged for a decade. As it approaches the end of the Millennium Development Goals, the nation's progress in water and sanitation far outpaces its advances in child and maternal health. The causes of this disparity are manifold, pointing to a need not for isolated interventions but for a fortification of the health system as a whole.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled workers, with 72% now meeting the target. Yet, this figure includes traditional midwives who lack the medical prowess to intervene in complicated pregnancies. Their inclusion skews the numbers, a stark reminder of the work yet to be done. Moreover, the rate of diarrheal cases treated by health professionals in children under five has dropped, and postnatal care remains a concern, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCaesarean section rates remain low, hovering around 4%, with urban areas performing significantly better than rural ones. This disparity underscores the inequitable distribution of healthcare services, heavily favoring urban areas. Additionally, the gap between the poorest and richest quintiles in service utilization is a staggering 27%, highlighting the financial barriers to healthcare for the impoverished.\n\nWith these issues in mind, the question arises: should Indonesia focus on targeted programmatic approaches or bolster the overall healthcare system? Programmatic interventions offer clear, manageable objectives and faster results. However, they have their drawbacks. Heavy investment in one area often starves others of funding and resources. Furthermore, the proliferation of uncoordinated, duplicative programs leads to an increase in administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature, with its meticulous attention to detail and abiding by the aristocratic norms of the era, is often constrained by a rigid adherence to tradition. Yet, amidst this rigid structure, two novels stand out: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works, like a lone wolf among the flock, embrace the strange and the untoward, employing a tincture of mystery and the bizarre that lends depth to their characters and insights into their motivations and emotions. Dickens, in Oliver Twist, captures this essence as he writes:\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels employ this mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though their function varies. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often unveil Oliver’s inner turmoil, his fears, and his awareness of the true nature of the events around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, he relives the experience as if in a dream, grappling for help. The passage underscores his lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as his dire physical state, reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbs all his senses, leaving him to experience his despair anew, unshocked by the pain, which now flows as constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. This lack of control over his fate forces the question: Whose will brought about his misfortune? For it was certainly not his own. The growing sense of defeat in Oliver is palpable, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, so that he can no longer react, even in the face of his own life.\n\n“And the day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.” (Dickens)",
            "A couple of years back, I found myself toiling as a tutor in an after-school program, helping young ones with their studies. My talents lay in the English and reading realms, yet I was roped into assisting a lad named Adrian, who was struggling mightily with his letters. The boy's predicament was peculiar. Some letters he'd pronounce as if he'd been born to the tongue, others he'd mangle like a drunken man. He hailed from a Latin household, but his English was as smooth as a river's flow. We wrestled with his struggles until fate intervened in the form of his mother, who swept into the room like a storm at sea. She spoke no English, only Spanish, and my grasp of the tongue was tenuous at best. We managed to communicate, though it was clumsy and stilted. And then it struck me like a thunderclap: the boy could read, but he was lost in the alphabet's maze.\n\nThis tale serves to illuminate the shadow cast by language barriers in our schools, particularly here in California. It's not always as clear as it seems. Even a child who speaks English like a native can be lost in the labyrinth of letters. We agree that this problem festers, so what's the remedy? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation, sufficed. Yet for those who barely speak the tongue, the solution is a tangled web.\n\nThe dual language system, a notion that's been given short shrift, could be a boon. It's not just for Spanish-speaking children, but for all. Research shows that those in such programs outperform their peers. Yet there's a fear that it's a waste of resources, that the majority will derive no benefit. This is a fallacy. If we integrated these programs into our classrooms, all children would reap the rewards. But how best to implement this? Should we insist on bilingual teachers? No, that's unrealistic. But having bilingual aides or tutors, that's something we could manage.",
            "From the moment we first draw breath, we are told there exists a force greater than ourselves, a void we cannot fathom. Some of us are instructed in its ways, while others turn to the temple or delve into the depths of their souls for answers. Many embrace the creeds passed down by those who came before, but some scoff at the notion, rejecting any notion of a world beyond our own egos. We traverse different paths, each seeking to define ourselves through our unique perceptions of the divine. We search for a guiding light to break the shadows that surround us.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" my father replied when I inquired about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the rain's relentless drumming on the tin roof accompanied by the steady rhythm of our cigarettes. The gutters gushed, extinguishing the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, his eyes reflecting an eternal search and a lingering memory. His once ample frame now hung loosely on him, his hair thinned and sparse. His gaze lingered on the rain, avoiding mine. I felt isolated, frightened, and unable to express the pain I would feel when he was gone, lest it become a reality for both of us. I embraced him tightly, moved my chair closer, and stared out into the June twilight's falling rain with him.\n\nIn December, five days after I reached the age of twenty-two, my father passed. The doctors' projections were bested only by the chemotherapy and radiation, which prolonged his suffering. What purpose it served, I could not comprehend. I lay in bed for three nights, curled into a ball and awaiting the news. No one telephoned.",
            "The so-called \"Gothic Novel,\" in essence a strange marriage of \"Old\" and \"New,\" as Ian Watt posits in his study, has been both reviled and revered, deemed shallow or profound, and celebrated for its capacity to evoke the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The first of such tales, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, fused the ancient and modern to birth the nascent Gothic mode, introducing a novel method of literary expression. Walpole, in his crafting of \"A Gothic Story,\" wove together old theatrical elements and new mimicry of nature, as seen in modern novels, to create a unique blend that would resonate through time. The Gothic genre, with its throwbacks to medieval theater, architecture, and tradition, baffled contemporaries, appearing archaic and unsophisticated in the face of modern societal and literary progress. Yet, it is this very fusion that allows Gothic to endure, forever new and obsolete to the displaced reader.\n\nChivalry, a cornerstone of Gothic fiction, is a prominent theme in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Walpole's work preserves and transforms the medieval ideal of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, reflecting his disillusionment with contemporary society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, Walpole romanticizes the past, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romanticism, as a means to aspire to a better present. Walpole, a man entangled in political turmoil and unfair accusations, may have felt the morality and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had vanished in his contemporaries. This is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits before our eyes ever meet him. His description includes phrases of a \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" a figure exaggerated, as is the Gothic tendency towards excess (66).",
            "The ceaseless dance of goods through the vast expanse of commerce, from the first whisper of a customer's desire to the final denouement of satisfaction, is what we know as supply chain management. Conceived in the crucible of 1982 by one Keith Oliver, a man of enterprise, it is the art of planning, executing, and guiding the ebb and flow of the supply chain to satisfy the customer's need with swift, efficient grace.\n\nSix are the cornerstones upon which this edifice is built: production, supply, inventory, location, conveyance, and knowledge. The manager, like the conductor of an orchestra, employs these elements to ensure the symphony of commerce plays to the customer's delight.\n\n**Production**, the first and foundational step, is the birthplace of the supply chain's essence. Here, the managers, as the midwives of industry, must discern the will of the market, the mother from whom all demands are born. The market, a vast, impersonal entity, tells us what the customer wants, and the manager, like a seer, deciphers its omens. Once the market's secrets are revealed, the manager decides what products shall be born and how many of them shall see the light of day. The where and how follow, with the manager choosing the plant that best serves the customer's needs, balancing volume and quality in the delicate dance of production.\n\nThe next key element, **supply**, is the strategic heart of the supply chain. Here, the manager decides the core capabilities of the facility and the paths of partnerships with others. For a single product, a company may have many divisions, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the best division for each process, like a master selecting the most skilled artisans for a task. Outsourcing may be the manager's choice, to quicken the pace, to inject flexibility and reduce costs, or to maintain the low, steady hum of efficiency.",
            "In the grimy heart of Burma, a land where the junta's iron grip stifles the voice of the people, a lone figure stands, cardboard sign held aloft like a flag of defiance. The words scrawled in Sharpie are a stark reminder: \"Hitler lives.\" Burma, or Myanmar, a nation where the scent of violence and oppression hang heavy in the air, has a history of subjugation that echoes through the generations. The monks, their saffron robes a beacon of hope, took to the streets in 2007, their chants echoing through the empty halls of power. But the junta's response was swift and brutal, monasteries laid waste, journalists imprisoned, and a photojournalist named Kenji Nagai gunned down for the crime of bearing witness.\n\nThe world is not new to such atrocities. The Roman emperors, with their god-king pretenses, the Japanese emperors and their divine right to rule, even the current president, Bush, with his weekly communions with Ted Haggard, all share a common thread of absolute power and the suppression of dissent. The Tiananmen Square massacre, where the cries of freedom were silenced by tanks, the Rwandan genocide, where the river ran red with innocent blood, and Hitler's Third Reich, where the Holocaust's shadow still looms over Europe - these are but a few instances of humanity's darkest hour.\n\nThe sign, Ellen Page's sign, is a testament to the human spirit's refusal to be broken. It is a beacon of defiance in the face of tyranny, a spark that can ignite a flame. For the world is not new to darkness, but perhaps, through such acts of bravery, it can be made anew.",
            "In this brutal, unforgiving world of jazz, Duke Ellington carved out a legacy that endured like a ancient stone beneath the earth. He was a master of his craft, a damn near sage in the realm of sound. His fingers danced upon the keys of his piano, subtle as the whisper of wind through leaves, yet his compositions were as vast and intricate as the darkest nights under the New Orleans moon.\n\nEllington's genius lay in his ability to shape his orchestra much like a god shapes a world. The piano, his instrument, was a voice in this symphony of souls he conducted. He composed pieces that were rich and complex, each note a pebble in a river that flowed with the individual talents of his band members. He crafted a stage where soloists could improvise like the wild, untamed spirits of the South, yet he also wrote phrases and melodies that called for each player's unique voice. In doing so, he created a tone so distinct, so original, that it echoed across the decades.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, a tome of sacred knowledge, speaks of Ellington's sound and innovation. It mentions Creole Love Call, a piece wherein he used the human voice as a jazz instrument, adding texture and color without the burden of lyrics. This early experiment was but one of many examples of Ellington's ear for tone and his ability to complement the voices of his soloists. Creole Love Call, a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues, is a tapestry of call and response between voice and reeds, each chorus a dance of the soul. Chorus by chorus, Ellington weaves a spellbinding narrative, from the smooth, melodic opening to the rough, growling finish. The final chorus, a return to the first, sees the voice take on the sound of the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument of the gods. It is a masterclass in tone, a symphony of sound.\n\nHot and Bothered, recorded the year following, finds Ellington combining his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing engage in a call and response, the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice creating a sound that is rich and complementary. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton introducing the melody on muted trombone, his sound as unique and haunting as a ghost in the night.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to his pieces is but one of the many stylistic traits that permeated his work. He was a composer of the highest order, a pioneer in the art of jazz. His legacy lives on, as eternal as the stars above the Mississippi delta.",
            "She'd always felt that something was missing, a void that gnawed at her, a yearning that refused to be sated. It began when she was barely fourteen, as she stumbled into the labyrinth of adolescence. Three years hence, at seventeen, she still sought, though her hunger had shifted from thing to person. Yet, no youth appealed to her, not even those who made their clumsy advances. She puzzled over this, her mind a whirlwind of theories and conjectures, each as fleeting as the morning dew. So she lived, and questioned, and waited.\n\nQuiet days at home, under the roof of her placid parents, were rare though she loved them well. Her father's calm demeanor, her mother's quiet fortitude, they never argued, not with each other, nor with their daughter. Except, perhaps, when she asserted her independence, her spirit wild as a stallion. Yet, she was their daughter, their beloved, her personality a beacon of light in their serene home.\n\nBut today was not one of those days. As she wandered the rooms, seeking some spark of inspiration for herself, she heard a cry, a wail that echoed through the house. It was her mother's voice, and it was filled with pain. She rushed to the kitchen, her heart pounding in her chest, her breath coming in short gasps. \"Mother? Mother, what is wrong?\" she cried out, her voice shaking.\n\nShe found her mother on the floor, writhing in agony, her breaths coming in short, sharp clips. \"Ow,\" she gasped, her voice barely audible. \"Sweet, take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter did not hesitate. She gathered her mother in her arms, her muscles straining under the weight, and carried her to the car. The drive was a blur, her mind filled with fear and worry, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nThe hospital was a place of antiseptic and suffering, a place of fear and pain. But she did not sense it, for her mind was occupied with her mother. She rushed her inside, her voice echoing through the halls as she called for help. Doctors and nurses swarmed around them, their faces etched with worry, and one of them gently guided her to a chair, leaving her to sit in anxious anticipation.\n\nIt turned out, her mother had fallen from a stool, trying to reach a vase in the highest cabinet. The vase was untouched, but her mother's body had taken the brunt of the fall.",
            "This study sought to illuminate the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as gauged by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", and the mitigation of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a variant of the Med diet, emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while deeming animal products and saturated fats as less desirable. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted within this regimen.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have established an inverse correlation between compliance with the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. In an intervention trial, the Med diet proved more effective than a low-fat diet in facilitating weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, these studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, between the ages of 38 and 63, who were free from cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes. Participants were drawn from the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses residing in 11 US states. Over the course of six assessments, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were deemed \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo account for random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to assess the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of both incident CHD and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (both fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the year of Our Lord, two thousand and seven, the United States of America was beset by a calamitous financial crisis. Unemployment rose like a spectral tide, the housing market crumbled as if struck by a divine wrath, and many of her most vaunted corporations lay in ruin, their towers reduced to empty shells. This recession, a scourge upon the land, continues to this day, and we are compelled to inquire: how did this catastrophe come to pass, and how may we forestall its recurrence?\n\nThe roots of this calamity can be traced back to the Clinton administration, in the year of Our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, as the President sought to secure his reelection by pandering to the whims of the people. To this end, he relaxed lending restrictions, thus setting the stage for the sub-prime debacle that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes, a journalist of the New York Times, warned of the perils that lay ahead: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes, in his prescient wisdom, foresaw the consequences of their folly: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" Thus, the seeds of our doom were sown.\n\nThe crisis was not a singular event, but a confluence of many factors. Among them was the emergence of a new and labyrinthine mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) became the order of the day, ensnaring more and more sectors of the economy in the housing market's grasp. This led to a state of overextension, a kind of mania that left households and financial markets alike vulnerable to even the slightest fluctuations in price.\n\nThe housing bubble, like some monstrous beast, burst forth with devastating force. The investment banks that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left with a bitter taste in their mouths, for they were now confronted with debts in excess of four trillion dollars, accounting for nearly a third of our GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold for a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercially regulated entities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with their five trillion dollars in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September of two thousand and eight.",
            "Ah, the realm of exposition.  A place where some authors take flight with their quill, their words painting vivid images that captivate, or a place where readers' eyes glaze over and their fingers fleetingly hover over the \"Back\" button, cursing the author's name.  Dr. Merlin, she has known such a fate, standing before her monitor, her brow furrowed, her voice raised in exasperation at the excess of words, the overwhelming tide of information.\n\nExposition, it is not your friend.\n\nThe lesson, \"Show, don't tell,\" is well-known, yet it is a lesson that Dr. Merlin, she still struggles with.  Like a wayward horse, she finds herself atop a mountain of words, with naught but the silence of the desert and the echo of her own thoughts to meet her halfway.  The devil on her shoulder, it whispers, \"Get the story on its way, get to the meat of it.\"  But the devil on the other shoulder, it urges, \"Tell them every detail, every twist, every tear that makes up your characters.\"\n\nExposition, it is the simple telling of what has been, what is, what will be.  In the theater of words, it is the actor who takes the stage and spouts lines, the audience's eyes wide and ears alert, yet somehow, not fully engaged.  In the realm of fiction, it is the author who takes the pen and paints the picture, the canvas filled with details, yet the colors muted, the image blurry.\n\nConsider the tale of the heroine and her love.  You would not expect, in the telling of their story, that the author would spend two pages, their words flowing like a river, the lovers only getting two lines of speech.  You would expect, you would crave, the author to flesh out the man, to show him through his words, his actions, his very being, how he loved his wife.  And you would expect the same from the woman, to see her through his eyes, to understand the depth of their bond, the richness of their love.  You would mourn his death with her, and in doing so, you would grow closer to her, to her heart, her dreams, her very essence.\n\nIn short, you would expect more than just the simple tale.  \"They met, they married, he died.\"  A tale told too briefly, too plainly.  As a writer, you must provide more.  The bread, you must wrap it in meat, you must season it, you must let it rest.  You must let it become a feast, a symphony of words that captivates, that leaves the reader's heart aching, their soul yearning for more.  For that is the power of exposition, not to merely tell, but to weave a tapestry of words, a story that lives, that breathes, that is more than just words on a page.",
            "In the chill of a Columbus dawn, I bore witness to two broadcasts from the belly of the beast, the city's appetite for the grim spectacle of its own making. The first, an NBC forum, spewed forth its tidings with a certain lethargic urgency. A man named Shad Hostettler, his features etched with the malevolence of a thousand lost souls, had been taken for the murder of his wife, her name a whisper on the wind. Her blood, spilled in the quiet of Ashley, Ohio, was but a fleeting tale, a mere two minutes' respite from the day's unsavory offerings. The second, a tale of a youth named Travis Buyers, shot down in the cold embrace of Sharon Woods, was told with a certain reserve, the color of his skin a shadow over the truth.\n\nThe third tale, a bullet's footprint upon a Med-Flight's metal skin, spoke of a .22 caliber's song, a dance with death. Crime-Stoppers, with their five-thousand dollar reward, were the symphony's conductors, the dance's choreographers. The fourth, a teaser for the weekend's storm, was but a fleeting thought, a whisper of the weather's wrath. The fifth, a robbery on Clime Road, was a report of a dark-skinned man, a Hoodie's specter, a vulture's cry. His features were described with a certain relish, the color of his skin a stark detail, a curiosity.\n\nThe final tale was of a man named Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic drug kingpin, his sentence a curious thing, not twenty-five years, but three hundred months, a march of time. His hue, it seemed, was a detail to be noted, a curiosity, a whisper in the wind.",
            "A bond between brothers, a tether that cannot be sundered, a bond as immutable as the wilds of the world, unyielding in its grip. Within it, emotions swirl like a storm, a tempestuous dance of love and loathing, of pride and jealousy, of cruelty and compassion. Brothers, they see themselves in each other, a mirror reflection in the eyes of their kin. It is in the direst of times that this bond reveals its true face, both in its grace and its malevolence. The cost is high, the price exacted in actions and their aftermath. To see oneself in a brother is to see not as others see, but as one truly is. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers wade through a verdant, vivid landscape, a stage for their futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with fierce pride in their climactic encounter, and only one emerges alive. This theme unfurls through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's eyes, which convey the protagonist's complex feelings and their impact on his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's heart is a battleground, a landscape sculpted by a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fatal expedition, he feels a gnawing resentment towards Doodle. He sought a brother who could be his equal, one to share his world with, to race to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine's top fork. But Doodle's frail heart, a fragile thing, made such dreams impossible. The young boy's head filled with wild fantasies, crushed in an instant. He, even, contemplated death's cold embrace for his brother, a thought born of bitter frustration. Yet, a simple smile from the child could melt his heart, a hope that gave his conviction a moment's pause. Deep within, a love for his brother burned, a love that could not be extinguished.",
            "The human brain, a labyrinthine tapestry of thought and perception, has long been the subject of metaphor and inquiry, much like the ancient maps that once doubled for the unkown. Initially, it was likened to a simple wax tablet, plain and unchanging, yet it quickly evolved into the sprawling expanse of a parchment scroll, then the bound tomes of libraries, and now, the cold, unyielding circuit board of a machine.\n\nTo grasp the brain's enigma, consider the humble inputs of the senses, the eyes, ears, and fingertips that translate the world into electrochemical signals - a strange alchemy of flesh and fire. These signals are then woven through the brain's algorithms, a dance of bottom-up and top-down, where each step builds upon the last, like the scaffolding of a grand cathedral. The world is perceived, recognized, and understood, with the aid of the brain's attention, a fickle sentinel that guides our awareness through the tide of sensation.\n\nMemory, too, is a vast and mysterious landscape, where information is encoded, stored, and maintained in the brain's strange architecture. The types of memory are as varied as the grains of sand on a desert shore, from the fleeting moments of sensory memory, to the vast expanse of long-term memory, where information is held in the very structure of proteins, as if carved into the stone of the mind.\n\nMany are the models that seek to explain the brain's organization, from the human experience of memory retrieval, to the cold logic of computer science, and the dance of neurons. One such model, the semantic network, posits a web of nodes and links, where concepts are like stars in a constellated sky, connected by their relatedness, a web of meaning spun from the threads of thought.",
            "In the realm of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a dystopian landscape looms large, where the specter of technology and capitalistic structures intertwine to create a chilling tableau. The citizens of this world, born into a system that prioritizes community over the individual, are conditioned from the cradle to pursue immediate gratification. They are, in truth, mere pawns in a grand design orchestrated by the World Controller, a puppet master who tugs at the strings of their existence. Through the lens of Marxist critique, the author's suspicions are laid bare, as the story unfolds like a cautionary tale against the excesses of economic systems.\n\nCapitalism is laid bare in the novel's stark portrayal, where the Marxist concept of false consciousness prevails. The common folk, blinded by their own desires, are kept from understanding the true dynamics of their economic plight. Ideological control has rendered them slaves to their consumerist impulses, their wills subsumed into the machinery of capitalism. The conditioning they undergo, through hypnopædia, stokes the fires of consumption and indulgence, manipulated by the World Controller to maintain the status quo.\n\nThe notion of hegemony is evident in Huxley's vision, as the lower classes are kept in the dark about their own oppression. The Delta, Gamma, and Gamma classes, content in their stations, are merely cogs in a wheel, unaware of the manipulation that keeps them in their place. The upper classes, born with the ability to see beyond their stations, choose to remain silent, few exceptions like Bernard or other characters only serving to highlight the prevailing komplizen passive acceptance.\n\nHuman connections are as shallow as the novel's characters, each a carbon copy of the last. The lack of depth and complexity in their interactions mirrors the dehumanizing effects of technology and capitalism, robbing individuals of their free will and expression. Love, and the extremes of emotion, are absent, replaced by superficial interactions that reduce individuals to their physical attributes or fleeting encounters. This societal structure, a mirror of Marxist thought, reflects the proletariat's false sense of superiority, so long as they continue to consume, obey, and remain in the fold.",
            "I've been abiding amongst these hallowed halls for near on two and a half years now, a span of four and a half learning seasons. The sprawl of this campus, once a vast and uncharted territory, now feels as crowded as a cathedral during mass. The East Halls, where I was once sequestered, stand as a testament to the campus's relentless expansion, a relic of times when vast stretches of untamed land lay between the student and the heart of knowledge. Now, those same fields are filled with sports arenas, or the new Creamery and health services building, and the encroachment of apartments, all bearing down on the dwindling sanctuaries of quiet contemplation.\n\nIn times past, these expanses were traversed by the sure-footed and the intrepid, but as the campus grew, so too did the distance between the student and the classroom. The bicycle, once a symbol of freedom and simplicity, now appears a necessity, a means to navigate this ever-expanding labyrinth.\n\nI spoke to a fellow traveler, a comrade in this journey of academia, who had recently rediscovered the pleasures of the two-wheeled steed. \"Why did we ever stop?\" he mused, \"Bikes are the only way to traverse these distances.\" And he was right. The bicycle, a simple and efficient conveyance, carries one from one end of the campus to the other, as swiftly as the wind through the trees. A bowl of porridge and a few minutes of exertion can span a considerable distance. Yet, the path to the Thomas Building, a mere twenty-five-minute walk, becomes a mere five-minute jaunt on a bicycle, a saving of time that is both precious and necessary.\n\nYet, the road is not always kind. Pollock Road, the most direct path, is a treacherous one, a gauntlet of broken glass and potholes. And in the cold and the rain, the journey becomes a true test of endurance. But the alternatives, the alternatives of walking, are even more daunting. The thought of spending an extra half hour to an hour each day on foot, a total of more than two and a half hours each week, is a heavy burden to bear. The bicycle, despite its flaws, remains the swiftest and most reliable mode of transport.\n\nThe campus, in its ceaseless growth, must adapt to the needs of its inhabitants. The bicycle, a symbol of both simplicity and progress, must be embraced, not just for the sake of efficiency, but for the sake of the students themselves. For in this age of constant motion, to be still is to fall behind."
