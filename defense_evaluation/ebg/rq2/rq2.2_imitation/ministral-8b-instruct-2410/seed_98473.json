            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my pursuit of a degree in social work, I intend to take up a post with the Division of Family and Children Services, aiming to bring succor and solace to children who have been blighted by the shadows of abuse and neglect. I also seek to instill hope and dignity into the lives of troubled families. The values I bring to this noble endeavor are service, respect, an unyielding adherence to ethics, and a commitment to foster healthier relationships between individuals. These are not mere professional virtues; they are the bedrock of my character.\n\nMy path to this calling has been a winding one. In my formative years, I witnessed many souls retreat into the comforting embrace of denial, seeking refuge in destructive coping mechanisms. These experiences left an indelible mark on me, driving me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. Yet, the path forward remained shrouded in uncertainty. Post-graduation, I took a breather, a period of introspection and contemplation.\n\nOne fateful summer, I found myself at a friend's residence, where I encountered a young lad, barely sixteen, shrinking timidly on her couch. His plight was stark and raw, a stark reminder of the darkness that can lurk within the shadows of a family. The next day, upon learning of his desperate call to the police, I ventured to his parents' abode, hoping to lend what aid I could. The police, recognizing my credentials, asked that I intervene, for the law's reach is limited in matters of the heart.\n\nThe parents, nervous and defensive, spun tales of their son's \"manipulative\" nature, dismissing his distress as mere \"simple\" family squabbles. This encounter, like a scouring wind, set me on a new path. I resolved to dedicate my life to the protection and nurturing of children trapped in the whirlwind of familial strife.\n\nSocial justice is another tenet that burns brightly within me. Society lauds the individual, yet we are bound by ancient traditions that stifle our unique selves. Why mourn the loss of one who has been forced to conform, when we should celebrate the individual's defiance? I have always stood against this societal tide, painting my hair in unnatural hues, donning clothes that spoke to my soul, piercing my ears beyond tradition's dictate, and declaring my membership in the GSBA. I have fought against racism and discrimination, and I will continue to do so until the day I die.",
            "The following discourse examines the Biological and Sociocultural paradigms in the context of the affliction known as insomnia. The Biological model concentrates on inheritable genetic information and the physiological facets of health. The Sociocultural model, conversely, surveys environmental relationships and their implications for race, ethnicity, demographics, and socio-economic status. This analysis of insomnia delves into these models, selecting specific research to elucidate and elaborate upon them. Critiques of the research and its findings follow, highlighting their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias and Parasomnias; secondary disorders are those linked with Axis I or Axis II mental disorders; tertiary disorders are those arising from medical conditions or substance intake. Primary Dyssomnias include: Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-related Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Insomnia, a primary Dyssomnia, is marked by difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep. Hypersomnia, another primary Dyssomnia, is characterized by an inability to remain awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves symptoms such as cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Primary Parasomnias, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, are marked by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep. The focus of this review is primarily on insomnia, with some consideration given to primary sleep disorders generally, in the context of the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers on genes, inherited traits, and the physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, are pivotal in regulating sleep and wakefulness. This study utilized mice to demonstrate that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are integral to sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor induces sleep-promoting responses, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Administration of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that animal models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. Impairment or absence of this receptor could impact one’s ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration would naturally disrupt it. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as academic pursuits, career prospects, and daily tasks requiring monotonous focus.",
            "This treatise unfolds into three distinct arenas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) as it is sometimes denominated. Firstly, we offer a concise elucidation of the affliction itself. Then, we delve into the process of its diagnosis, identifying the common markers, or \"red flags,\" that signify its presence. Lastly, we conclude with strategies for a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment to aid a student grappling with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, a malady of the central nervous system, denotes the efficaciousness and efficacy with which the brain processes auditory information. More narrowly construed, it refers to the CNS's perceptual processing of sound and the neurobiologic underpinnings of that processing, resulting in electrophysiological auditory potentials. In simpler terms, it is a disorder wherein the brain fails to properly interpret what we hear, despite normal hearing. Those stricken with CAPD do not suffer from \"hearing impairment,\" but rather, the region of the brain tasked with translating sounds, particularly distinguishing words amidst background noise, malfunctions.\n\nThe first whispers of this disorder emerged in the mid-1950s, when researchers encountered children with communicative disorders. The Italian trio of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing diagnostic tests for these young ones in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to elucidate the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) underlying such perception. A seminal conference held in 1977 catalyzed further research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD vary widely: the afflicted may struggle to localize sounds in space, differentiate between multiple sound events, recognize sound patterns, discern changes in speech, or integrate sound clues. They may also be confounded by a subsequent sound blocking out the previous one, or be unable to determine the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosing CAPD involves \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" executed by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or other specialists employing an array of measures. No single tool or test guarantees a high rate of diagnostic success, and the cause of CAPD remains elusive. Tests often present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and request the identification of specific items. More advanced methods involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",

A disguise, once donned, becomes a prison, and the deceiver, a captive, forever haunted by the specter of their own making.\n\nThe question then arises: Why does Viola, in her plight, choose the guise of a man? Is it not a form of self-preservation, a shield against the harsh world she finds herself in? \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Yet, in assuming this new identity, she cuts herself off from the women she would normally turn to, depriving herself of a vital support system.\n\nMoreover, her disguise does not go unnoticed. Olivia, mistaking her for her brother, is smitten. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) And then there is Orsino, who, in his words, is drawn to her as a man would be to a woman. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nIn this tale, deception serves as a catalyst, forcing suppressed emotions to the surface. Olivia's affections for Cesario are they of a man, or a woman in disguise? Or does she harbor a secret longing for the same sex, a longing that Cesario's appearance forces her to confront? It is a question that lingers, a question that Shakespeare seems to leave unanswered, save for the ease with which Olivia shifts her affections, from Cesario to Sebastian, regarding Cesario/Viola as family rather than love interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "In the annals of colonial brutality, the German empire's reign over South West Africa stands as a grim testament, notably for the wholesale annihilation of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. Yet, such a monolithic description does scant justice to the empire's varied apparatus and methods. Educational endeavors, like the empire itself, varied widely across its colonial outposts. When the British took possession of German East Africa in 1919, they found a populace well-versed in the art of literacy and learning. Likewise, the educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were met with approbation from contemporaries. However, the terrain of South West Africa (now Namibia) bore a starkly different hue.\n\nUnlike in East Africa, where the state took a direct hand in the education of the natives, South West Africa's educational burden was largely shouldered by missionaries, receiving meager government aid. The colonial government, however, lavished resources on the education of Europeans, establishing a robust system of state schools and bolstering missionary efforts. These policies cast a long shadow, shaping the educational landscape long after the Germans' departure. While other colonies boasted significant numbers of literate natives, South West Africa's populace remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. A confluence of social, political, and economic factors birthed this divergent experience. This paper embarks on an investigation to elucidate these factors, with a keen eye on new research into the settlers' and authorities' attitudes towards the indigenous populace.\n\nA plethora of literature chronicles the educational landscape of the German colonial empire, most notably during its waning years. The majority of these sources are in the German tongue, penned during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works sought to describe the educational systems with a matter-of-factness, while later English-language studies broadened the discourse with comparative analyses and detailed examinations. Cohen's work, in particular, stands out, comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and positing the large settler population as a key factor in shaping South West Africa's educational landscape.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate, while moderately temperate, bore a stark contrast to the arid deserts that covered much of the territory. This relative hospitability was reflected in its European population, which, by 1913, numbered nearly 15,000, dwarfing the next largest settler population in East Africa, which stood at a mere 5,336.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded over the past century to encompass a multitude of genres, many of which have given birth to numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Arguably, the sub-genre of heavy metal, born from the crucible of rock and roll, has become one of the most diverse and expressive of them all. Its diversity stems from the realization that it held a flexibility unparalleled within the realm of popular music, allowing artists to forge their own path and spawn an innumerable array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has reached a point of such niche specialization that it is difficult to pin down what exactly constitutes heavy metal. It incorporates themes from various other genres, yet it is rooted in the darkness that has long been its hallmark. Metal is, in many ways, a \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It is less primitive, more skilled, the musicians displaying a mastery of their instruments that is unmistakable.\n\nMetal is also a movement steeped in the darker, more visceral qualities that have long been shunned by popular music. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to a wild, otherworldly sound that served as a release for the darker aspects of the human experience. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era, which embraced the darker, more melancholic emotions. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" display the darker side of music, a theme that resonates through the history of heavy metal. This song, considered one of the first heavy metal tracks, was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, darker sound. The Beatles sought to prove that they could match the Stones' intensity, leading to the creation of a track that would forever change the landscape of popular music.",
            "In the annals of time, ere the Surrealists took to canvas their fantastical visions, there walked among us an artist named Henri Rousseau. Born in the hamlet of Laval, northwest France, he was not of the educated sort, his father a humble tinsmith and hardware dealer, their prosperity but a shadow of the bourgeois life. From boy to man, he bore no brush nor palette, save for the requisite tools of his trade as a gabelou, a municipal toll collector. His life, a tapestry woven with threads of toil and strife, saw him widowed thrice, his heart a desolate plain save for his daughter Julia. To this world of sorrow, he turned to painting, a sanctuary from the storm of his grief.\n\nHis oils, they are not the product of a learned hand, but the unvarnished dreams of a man who yearned for acceptance, for praise. The Dream, his masterpiece of 1910, is not merely a woman lost in reverie, but Rousseau’s own heart laid bare, his dreams and fears entwined. To conform or to forge his own path, that was the dilemma that gnawed at him, a choice between mimicry and authenticity.\n\nTo fully comprehend The Dream, one must first know the man. Rousseau was a painter of the common folk, his hopes and dreams as ordinary as the men and women he painted. His struggle, it was not born of pride, but desperation, for he was an old man, uneducated, painting in an era where geniuses thronged the salons. Recognition came late, like a reluctant stranger, when Matisse had already begun to make his name. But while Matisse feared the trite, Rousseau craved the ordinary, for it was in the mundane that he found his voice.",
            "The great minds have long posited an intimate kinship between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty, a connection as profound as the roots entwined in the dark earth. It is a bond of the spirit, not the intellect, a dance of souls rather than a debate of minds. As Keats so pithily put it, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding of life is gleaned through education or experience, yet we seem to apprehend ethics and aesthetics without these overt guides. They are not prescribed, but described, not rules but explanations. We seek to comprehend why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than dictate how to create good art or moral behavior.\n\nMoreover, any critique of art or morality can never fully encapsulate the essence of that which it seeks to elucidate. A discourse on da Vinci's Mona Lisa might dwell on technical aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these do not illuminate why it is art. When queried about a beloved work of art or literature, one commonly hears, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more complex explication. This \"something\" defies description, a transcendent quality that imbues both art and morality with a power that cannot be quantified. As O'Connor aptly noted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"\n\nEthics, too, possesses this same evasive nature. Wittgenstein proclaimed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this \"something,\" this ineffable essence, that is art and morality's most potent attribute, and it is this transcendental nature that links them. We experience both morality and art at a level that is felt, yet elusive, a noumenal realm as Kant might describe. The art of literature, particularly, is steeped in this moral quality. As McKean observed, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the shadows of the Alps, from the frost-kissed peaks of München to the Baltic's icy embrace in Kiel, Germany stands united. A land of stark contrasts and ancient echoes, its culture a tapestry woven from the threads of the past. From Köln, with the Rhine's steady whisper, to the heart of the land and the Elbe's steady flow, the spirit of Germania pulses through the veins of this nation.\n\nThe origins of the name, Germania, are shrouded in the mists of history, a wrestling match between scholars and historians. Tacitus, in his 98 AD work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" spoke of the Germans as an aboriginal people, untouched by the hands of time. Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, a tale of conquest and blood, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish those he had not yet conquered from those he had. The origin, perhaps, a Gaulish word for neighbor, or a shout from the battlefield, a Ger, the ancient spear's cry.\n\nTacitus, in his account, noted the reluctance of the Romans to venture into the wilds of Germania, the icy lands with their sullen manners and harsh skies. The Germanic tribes, appearing on the borders of the empire in the first century, were a people of the land, their goods and skills traded for Roman gold and their warriors for the legions' ranks. They were a people of the borderlands, a people of the frontier, their existence a testament to the enduring spirit of a nation.",
            "I stared down, mind empty, eyes tracing the scene before me. Unmoved, silent, my senses acute yet unyielding, I observed the tableau with the cold, precise gaze of a man trained to see, not feel. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness, ephemeral as dust motes in sunlight, leaving no trace behind. It was as if my mind was a still lake, reflecting the world around me without judgment or distraction.\n\nOnce, a mentor gifted me a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since childhood, I'd yearned to capture what I saw, yet this task seemed as daunting as scaling a snowy peak. The book held the key, offering techniques to tame the wild chaos of perception. It taught me to frame my view, to simplify the complex into the manageable.\n\nYet, this day, I stood before a conundrum, a testament to human folly - a clogged toilet, a reminder of the mess we leave behind. I was no artist of the caliber of Picasso or Monet, but here, in this humble act, was my canvas, my story. My fingers tightened around the handle, my muscles tensing and releasing with practiced ease. I felt the power of creation, the thrill of imposing order on chaos.\n\nWater swirled, a serene dance of liquid, clear and clean. I struck the handle again, my frustration mounting with each futile attempt. The offending object remained, a stubborn rebuke to my efforts. I gripped the mop, my feet planted firmly, the green tie a noose around my neck. I was a man before a task, not a warrior, but a soldier nonetheless.\n\nThe wall's paper roll unraveled, wrapping my hand like an oven mitt. My mind wandered, the images of my would-be masterpieces dancing in the periphery of my vision. I dipped my hand into the cold water, the stark contrast jarring yet familiar. It was a ritual, a dance with the grotesque, a ballet of the banal. I was the artist, the janitor, the observer, the participant. I was, in that moment, everything.",
            "In the womb of concrete and steel, beneath the pallid glow of street lamps, the young die. A symphony of sterile statistics sings the same grim melody, echoing the deadly dance of the youngest drivers. The National Institutes of Health whisper in the language of science, their voices like the cold wind through the desert, that the teen brain is an untamed thing, unready for the perils of the open road. It is an inexperience that bites like a rattler, gnawing at the heart of the problem, spawning fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and roadsides where vehicles lie like fallen angels.\n\nThe company of peers, a vice that knows no age, clings to the young like a plague. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center reports that as the number of passengers increases, so too does the toll on the road. The shadows of the night grow long and dangerous, mirroring the shadows cast by the faces of youth.\n\nProvisional licenses, a mere bandage on a festering wound, are but a stopgap measure, a futile attempt to stem the tide. The truth is stark and unyielding: the youngest drivers, as a collective, are not yet fit to bear the risks and responsibilities. Marvin Zuckerman, a man who has delved into the depths of the human psyche, believes even 18 is too young. USA Today carries his words like a funeral procession, reporting that those under the age of 19-20 are drawn to the thrill of sensation, like moths to a flame.\n\nThe road awaits, yet the driver is not ready. The Baby Boomers' children, millions strong, stand at the precipice, ready to embrace the wheel. The tide of death will not be stemmed until the youngest drivers are given time to grow, to learn, to understand that the road is not a toy but a weapon, and that the thrill of speed is a dance with the devil.\n\nLegislation, a heavy hand upon the shoulder, must guide the young. Schools should keep their classrooms as sanctuaries, not graveyards. No motor vehicle shall be operated by one under the age of 18, save under the watchful eye of the law. A provisional permit, a stepping stone to the great highway, should be granted, but only after a certain number of hours, mirroring the practice of those states who have walked this path before. The law, uniform and unyielding, should protect the young across the nation, a shield against the deadly statistics.\n\nThis idea, this call for change, is not without precedence, a cry in the wilderness that has echoed before. Yet, it is a cry that must be heeded, a siren song in the face of the encroaching storm.",
            "In the dusty, labyrinthine halls of the Library of Congress's archives, I chanced upon a collection of Edison's early films, a collection that bore within it the seeds of illusion. Fifteen films, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901, these were trick films, each a testament to the ingenuity of their creators. My study delved into the poetics of these films, and the peculiarities that distinguished a few, later works.\n\nThe trick film of the turn of the century was a creature of its time, bound by the confines of the stage, framed by the proscenium, and bereft of the camera's movement. It was a world of long and medium shots, where the one shot equaled one film. Yet, a few dared to defy these boundaries, introducing the concept of multiple shots. The most striking feature these films shared was their setting: an interior stage, a proscenium, a frontality that echoed the theatre and vaudeville traditions.\n\nIn these films, actors moved side-to-side, like marionettes on a string, never venturing forth or retreating from the camera. The film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900) exemplifies this, with actors entering from the right, moving back and forth along the horizontal axis, always within the frame, the camera unmoving. Long and medium shots were the norm, close-ups absent, a nod to the theatre's practice of showing the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's borders.\n\nThe one shot equaling one film was the rule, limiting the films' length to a minute or less. This also limited their dramatic potential, reducing them to brief vaudeville-style tricks. Yet, a closer look at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) reveals the ruse: what appears to be one shot is actually many, joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance.",
            "In the verdant expanse of Caroline, John Taylor, a man of the soil and the soul, stood as an early and fervent champion of the Republican cause. Though his hands were stained with the earth and the ink of political discourse, it was his indomitable spirit that earned him renown, a spirit that burned bright with the flame of personal liberty and government accountability. His agrarian roots ran deep, and it was from this fertile ground that he drew the seeds of his convictions, nourished them with the waters of his political experience, and let them grow into a compendium of beliefs that embraced the sanctity of sovereignty, the sanctity of the Constitution, and the sanctity of the judicial system.\n\nTaylor, like a good farmer, saw in the new nation a field untill now, free from the weeds of native tradition that had choked the roots of old civilizations. Here, he believed, lay the opportunity to cultivate an ideal political system, a system born of natural rights, interdependent and indivisible. He saw these rights as the very essence of man, not to be trampled by the boot of government. In a world where strength and malice could easily flourish, he advocated for a civilization that shackled these dark tendencies, that tempered them with the light of justice and equity.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the inherent good and evil within man, a duality as old as time itself. He believed that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Taylor, pg. 167). His notion of good principles were those that safeguarded private property, fostered agriculture, and discouraged the rise of capitalism, for he saw in it the seeds of inequality and exploitation. A government founded on such principles, he argued, would function justly, regardless of the corrupting influence of avarice and self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many of his Republican brethren, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He saw in it a document that, if interpreted literally, could become a sword in the hands of the corrupt, a means for the federal government to grow fat and tyrannical. Yet, he also warned against a strictly literal interpretation, for it could easily become a rope, used to hang the intent of the founders. He held the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, for it more clearly described the nation as a union of sovereign states, not a single nation bound by the chains of federal power.",
            "Revisiting Figure 17, a stark decline in commuter log submissions occurred in the third month. This was a sobering sight, and the cause remains elusive. The New England winter, with its chilling grip, would account for some of the drop, as folks either pedal or stride less. The end of the fall semester, with its flurry of assignments and grading, may have led many to overlook the log. Additionally, December's festive flurry and ensuing month-long respite from campus duties diminished engagement. Classes resumed in late January, yet February's low log count remained unexplained. One might ponder the inevitable ebb in enthusiasm at the project's inception, countered by our Carpool Challenge Week in March, which spurred a renewed surge in submissions.\n\nBut a deeper challenge persists: the primacy of driving, a deeply ingrained cultural preference. To spur alternative modes of commuting, we offered inducements — gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, a bookstore, even national chains. Yet, larger prizes such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars might have incentivized more participation. A progressive scale of prizes, from modest to grand, could have sustained engagement. The gift cards we started with seemed sufficient, but an announcement of grander prizes in December and January could have reversed the drop in February.",
            "In the realm of investment, an ETF, or exchange-traded fund, doth represent a curious beast. Unlike its index fund kin, it doth not merely mimic an index or a basket of assets, but trades like a stock upon the exchange. The ETF, much like a single stock, offereth flexibility and the ability to be sold short or bought on margin, all with the benefit of the lowest expense ratios among mutual funds. Yet, like the trading of stock, a commission is paid for each transaction involving an ETF.\n\nThe allure of such an investment lies in the diversity of funds available, akin to the myriad of paths in a forest. However, as with any path, it is prudent for the discerning investor to evaluate the true worth of the promises made. In this instance, we shall examine the ETF IHF, comparing it against the top ten holdings that constitute the bulk of its assets.\n\nTo facilitate our examination, we shall consider only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below are listed the top ten holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge the efficacy of these holdings in representing the ETF IHF, we shall employ the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return. The following chart presents these calculations.\n\nUpon reviewing the chart, it is clear that a portfolio composed solely of the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. Furthermore, the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings may offer a superior return with a lower risk. However, it is necessary to ascertain if the means of these portfolios are indeed statistically different.\n\nTo accomplish this, we shall determine the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the realm of Edgar Allan Poe's literary canon, \"Dream-Land\" stands as a paragon of sorts, a work that bears the unmistakable mark of his genius. Within its hallowed pages, he employs the term \"Thulé\" in verses six and fifty-six, a reference that traces its origins back to the annals of Virgil. Whispers of this mystical isle, north of Britain and at the edge of the known world, have echoed through the ages, but Poe's use of it in his poem is not a mere echo, but a deliberate invocation, a call to the reader to consider the darker corners of the mind and the heart.\n\nIt is certain that Virgil did indeed utilize this term, but there exists a more contemporary source to which credit must be given, one that bears the imprimatur of Poe's own literary pursuits. For Poe, the lands beyond Thulé were not simply the domain of distant islands and ancient scribes, but a bridge to the works of the German masters. Karl J. Arndt, in his exhaustive study \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between the two poets' works, suggesting that Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is a homage, a profound imitation of Goethe's \"Mignon.\"\n\nGoethe, a celebrated writer of poetic drama, penned \"Faust\" in two parts—the first in 1808, the second in the year of his death, 1832. Within the second part, a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" unfolds, a tale of a king who loses his queen, his will to live, and ultimately, his kingdom. The parallels between the king of Thulé and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are stark, a dark doppelganger of Poe's own struggles with loss and his crutch of drinking. Faust, composed into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, would have been fresh in Poe's mind, a mere year before he invoked the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe's references to Thulé are not mere coincidences, but deliberate threads woven into the tapestry of his collected works. He employs the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but it is in \"Dream-Land\" that Thulé serves as a bookend, a frame for his poetic endeavors. \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" can be read as companion pieces, mirror images of each other, bound by the dark hues of loss and despair. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker's descent into the land of Thulé is a descent into the abyss of his own psyche, a realm haunted by the specters of dead friends and shrouded in a world without color. It is as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem, a testament to the profound influence of the German master on Poe's literary journey.\n\nGoethe, with his vast body of work, would have been a significant presence in Poe's literary life, even if only through the mediation of other writers. Poe's own words on Tennyson, a writer he admired, suggest a respect for German literature that transcended the boundaries of language and culture. The reproductions and translations of Goethe's works, which were proliferating in Poe's time, would have led him to the shores of Thulé and the dark heart of Faust.",
            "In the law of California, a patron who finds themselves laid low by an applesauce spill in a grocery store might well claim punitive damages, if the manager's actions were found wanting in the court's eye. The law demands that to secure such damages, the plaintiff must prove the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that would follow, and that the conduct was indeed despicable. For Jennifer Palmer, who slipped and fell, this is a reasonable case to make. Martin, the manager, had been warned thrice of the spill, yet held fast to his dinner, allowing the apple jelly to claim another victim.\n\nMartin's defense will be weak indeed. He had been informed of the slippery situation twice before, yet failed to act. Such inaction, when seen through the lens of six similar incidents in the year prior, does not bode well for his case. It is the kind of reckless disregard that courts do not take kindly to. For Palmer to win punitive damages, she need only prove that Martin knew the consequences of his inaction, and that his conduct was indeed despicable.\n\nConsider the events of October 13, 2009. At five o'clock, Wayne, an employee, notified Martin of the spill. The manager, midway through his repast, declared he had no time for such trivialities. Fifteen minutes later, Haddigan, another employee, relayed the same message. By half past five, Palmer was on the ground, her back forever changed. This is not a tale of simple negligence, but of willful disregard for the safety of others.\n\nIn this state, a plaintiff can seek punitive damages for conduct that is oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious, as defined by the law. The conduct in question must be despicable, and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. It is conduct that demonstrates a conscious disregard for the probable dangerous consequences of one's actions. And this, dear court, is precisely what Martin's conduct was.",
            "Four years hence, I undertook an examination of Islam at CBC, wherein the tumultuous debates centered on whether Islam harbored a hostility akin to that of a ravenous beast. The pertinence of this query seems to have only deepened in the annals of time since that fateful day of September eleventh. Observing the pendulum swing of media sentiment, I have witnessed a shift from the hostile to the tolerant, as if the lips of our nation had been kissed by a serpent's tongue and then by an angel's. In the year of our Lord 2001, could we have ever imagined a presidential candidate bearing the name Barack Obama, with a lineage that bore the mark of Islam?\n\nThe biography of our Prophet holds a peculiar allure, for it presents a tale of Muhammad that seems to defy the iron fist I had once believed him to wield. According to the annals of history, it was not the sword, but the word, that he used to convert the heathen tribes. His humility, it is said, was a beacon that drew the lost sheep to his flock. Yet, the contradiction gnaws at my soul like a rat at a carcass. For I am reminded of the Gospel, where the Son of Man performed miracles that were not mere parlor tricks, but demonstrations of His divinity. It is as if the chroniclers sought to mimic the lofty and divine, only to diminish the very essence of the Almighty.\n\nThe accounts are riddled with tales of converts, yet many of these narratives are secondhand, relayed through a chain of voices that grow fainter with each telling. This indirect approach, meant to validate the truth, serves only to cast doubt upon the veracity of the stories, like a shadow that darkens the light.\n\nWhat vexes me most is the effort to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal of godliness, a paragon of humility and wisdom. Yet, history, that unyielding chronicle, paints a portrait of a man of steel and fire, not the gentle lamb they portray. I cannot help but wonder if the adherents of Islam today are aware of the truth that lies buried beneath the sands of time.",
            "In the wake of His crucifixion, the teachings of the Nazarene were cast adrift, lost amidst the currents of Christian thought that flowed in the centuries to come. A cursory glance at history reveals a drift, a slow, steady drift from the original tenets of faith. The world today bears witness to a growing awareness, a progressive tendency that seems to know no bounds. While those who cling to tradition persist, their voice fades, their influence wanes. Yet, among the faithful, a hunger gnaws, a hunger to discern the doctrines that have been layered upon the religion as if it were a corpse, wrapped in cloths of dogma. This is not a fleeting fancy, but a tide that will sweep through the ages, reversing the clock of history. The clock that ticks backward, stripping away the accretions of time, will leave naught but a kernel, a core belief: the word of Jesus, the son of Mary, before any other hand wrote his name upon the scriptures.\n\nWhen this tide reaches the shores of the New World and the old, it will not be met by the resistance of tradition, but by the embrace of unity. For the church, as an institution, will stand tall and unyielding, a rock in the storm. But the clock will have reversed, and with it, the proliferation of diversity will give way to uniformity. The differences that once divided will give way to an echo of belief, a chorus of faith. History is a river, and it too has its reversals. From the persecution of the Christians by the Romans, to the rise of a Christian empire, to the transformation of a nation from the bonds of slavery to the hand of leadership, so shall it be in the arena of faith. The great reversion will unveil the source, and in its wake, it will undo the divisions that have festered like wounds. But this reversal will not be wrought by the literal interpretation of the Nazarene's words. No, it will be the metaphor that will lead us back to the heart of His message, to the wellspring of faith.\n\nAnd so, we must look back, far back, to the time before the Romans, to the time when the Jews were but a people, divided among themselves. For it was then that the foundation was laid, the core belief that would spark the fire, the monotheism that would be the light in the darkness. The Hebrew scriptures, divinely revealed, held the authority that would shape the world. But the people did not share one spirit, they were divided: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk. Yet, amidst these divisions, a seed was sown, a seed that would grow into the tree of faith we know today.",
            "In the grim heart of The Jungle, Upton Sinclair lays bare the cold, unyielding truth of human nature. It is a truth so stark and starkly bleak that it seems to cry out from the very gutters of Packingtown itself. The men who hold the reins of power, the owners and managers, they are but vultures, their eyes fixed on the horizon, hungering for more, more, always more. They care not for the wretched souls who toil in their factories, nor for the foul effluvium that chokes the air and poisons the earth. The factories stand like monstrous, blackened titans against the sky, their chimneys belching forth rivers of smoke, a constant, acrid testament to their disregard for life and nature. Sinclair paints a picture so vivid, so stark, that one can almost smell the acrid stench of the animals' waste and urine, and feel the bitter taste of the poisoned rain on one's tongue.\n\nThe men who wield power in this realm care not for the men who serve them. They are but cogs in a great, grinding machine, their worth measured in the dollars they generate. They work long hours in the stench and filth of the factories, their backs bent, their spirits broken, all for the fleeting promise of a dollar's worth of sustenance. And when the owners and managers deem it fit, they cast them aside like so much refuse, their lives and livelihoods discarded with as little concern as they would a used and torn rag. There were no protections then, no safety nets to catch the fallen. The unions, they were little more than bandits, preying on the weak and the desperate for a fraction of the crumbs that fell from the table of the mighty. The workers were slaves, in all but name, chained to their toil, their lives dictated by the whim of their masters. And so, they suffered, and they died, their bodies and their spirits broken, their lives snuffed out like the candles in the gloom of Packingtown. And still, the factories stood, and the owners and managers watched, their eyes ever fixed on the horizon, hungering for more, more, always more.",
            "In the vast tapestry of literature, authors employ manifold techniques to weave a particular atmosphere or tone around their subjects. Among these, F. Scott Fitzgerald's mastery in The Great Gatsby is a testament to the power of symbolism and the pairing of incongruous elements. Fitzgerald's use of color to evoke sentiment is particularly noteworthy. He imbues certain hues with profound significance, transforming them into vehicles for emotion and meaning.\n\nWhite and gray, in particular, are loaded with connotation in Fitzgerald's novel. White, often associated with purity and sophistication, is employed to signify the upper echelons of society, while gray, with its association to age and decay, represents the faded remnants of that upper class. This duality is evident from the outset. Daisy and Jordan, for instance, are consistently portrayed in white attire, while Nick's attire at Gatsby's party, a \"white flannel suit\" (41), underscores this theme of uniformity and privilege. Even the background, the \"white chasms\" (56) of lower New York, reinforces this idea. Conversely, the \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable and the \"gray cars\" (23) in the valley of ashes represent the ordinariness and transience of the lower class. The dog seller, too, is a \"gray old man\" (27), suggesting the decay and monotony of his life.\n\nFitzgerald builds upon this color imagery, subtly reinforcing their meanings throughout the novel. When Daisy is described as wearing a \"white dress\" (74), the reader is reminded of her uniform status as an object of Gatsby's affection, rather than a multifaceted character. The \"gray haze\" (18) of Daisy's fur collar further emphasizes this uniformity, as does her subsequent appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's altercation. This consistent use of white and gray to denote Daisy as a mere symbol of Gatsby's longing underscores Fitzgerald's ability to manipulate color to convey complex sentiments.",
            "In the arid expanse of San Diego County, the sun-baked earth yields a bounty of crops, nurtured by an unyielding climate. Tomatoes and citrus, leafy greens and squash, peppers and peaches, all flourish under the relentless sun. The land, a tapestry of chaparral and nonnative grasses, is a symphony of growth, where honeybees hum and birdsong echoes. The market for organic produce is robust, with a hunger for the pure and the natural, a niche that many have sought to fill, their waiting lists stretching on like a serpent's path.\n\nThe cost of this purity is steep, for the landowner must toil with hands and mind, not with the lazy reach of chemicals. Pests and weeds must be vanquished by the sweat of the brow, and the soil nourished with the wisdom of time and care. Losses are frequent, for the organic path is a winding one, fraught with uncertainty. But the rewards are manifold, for the land becomes a sanctuary, a haven for the wild, where the air is clear and the water pure. The landowner walks a tightrope, seeking balance between profit and preservation, between the needs of the market and the needs of the land.\n\nThe parcel in question sits on the edge of Potrero, a relic of a time long past, a testament to the tenacity of the human spirit. It is 160 acres of chaparral and oak woodland, next to the Cleveland National Forest, a haven for creatures great and small. The air is thick with the scent of pine and the whisper of wind through leaves, a symphony of life, where the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog still roam.\n\nThis land was once the domain of the indigenous people, their footprints echoing through the ages. Then came the ranchers, their cattle and their dreams, their axes and their fires. Now, the land lies fallow, a silent witness to the ebb and flow of time.\n\nThe landowner, a seeker of balance and a lover of the wild, has chosen this piece of earth as his canvas, his challenge. He scours the government's offerings, seeking aid and wisdom, a path to profitability and preservation. And so, he finds himself in the company of others, who have walked this path before, their farms nestled in the foothills, their fields a testament to the possibility of a different kind of future.",
            "Culture bears a certain weight on any discourse, like the ghost in the machine. It is not a singular thing, nor is it a simple equation. One must understand that culture is not a monolith, but a complex landscape, ever-shifting and ever-mystifying. It is as much about what it is not as what it is, and what it signifies. The notion that \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is as foolish as the man who believes the sun circles the earth.\n\nWhen one steps into the realm of another, they do not see a culture as an objective truth, but through the prism of their own. Comparisons are inevitable, and it is in these comparisons that understanding can begin. To grasp a foreign culture, one must first study its history, its prejudices, its ghosts. Not to judge or to change, but to accept, to respect, to work within its boundaries. For the negotiator who comes to the table with a weaker hand, the respect for tradition and belief is not just an adornment, but a lifeline.\n\nCulture is not confined to borders, but resides in the hearts and minds of men. Corporations, for instance, bear their own peculiar cultures, like islands in a sea. Some glorify long hours, others a more relaxed pace. It is in employee dress, communication style, hiring practices, even the charities they support, that a culture is revealed. The American corporate culture? It is a labyrinth, a landscape of diversity. Some cultures appear uniform, like a vast plain, but they too hide valleys and mountains.\n\nValues, they are the heart of a culture, the why behind the what. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, then the negotiator must tread lightly, lest he cause offense. If a hard-driven bargain is the order of the day, then patience is a virtue. Understanding these things before the negotiation begins is not just beneficial, it is essential. But a negotiator would be wise to learn something of his adversary, to peer into their soul, to make the negotiation more than just a dance of words.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.' So spake the Psalmist, and the same sentiment echoed in the mind of Saint Anselm, who sought to prove the existence of the divine through the lens of faith and introspection. As we traverse the path of these two learned men, we must first acknowledge their shared belief in the existence of the God of the Bible, lest we stray from the very essence of their arguments. To do otherwise would be like trying to compare night and day, for both men are firmly rooted in the belief that a single divine entity stands at the center of existence.\n\nAnselm's path is one of the spirit, a journey inward to find the proof of God within the confines of our own souls. He posits that the very notion of God's nonexistence is not something we can comprehend, for it lies beyond the realm of our understanding. The proof for God, then, is not to be found in the outside world, but within our own minds, where we innately know the truth. This is faith, the acceptance of that which cannot be proven by empirical means, yet is steadfastly believed.\n\nContrast this with the path of Saint Thomas Aquinas, who sought to prove the existence of God through reason and empirical evidence. He believed that no faith was necessary, for logic alone could persuade even the most skeptical. Five arguments he laid forth: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, each a logical necessity pointing to the existence of God. To him, the proof of God was as straightforward as knowing the missing piece of a puzzle, for the whole exists only because the missing piece is present.\n\nYet, both men, in their pursuit of truth, leave us with a question. For neither provides a holistic basis for belief in God. Their arguments, while strong and valid, fail to account for the complexity of faith and its role in our understanding of the divine.",
            "In the quietude of the fifth or sixth century before the common era, a prince was born, whom the world would come to know as Buddha. His journey led him to renounce the trappings of his birth and embrace enlightenment, birthing a creed that would become Buddhism—a faith that, in its Theravada iteration, boasts a history of nearly twenty-five hundred years. This path, however, is not static; it has evolved, much like the ancient Lanka where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a ritual that bears little resemblance to Buddha's teachings. This transformation is not confined to mere traditions but permeates the very essence of the religion, as both monks and laymen must adapt to new doctrinal principles, shaped by forces that are as varied as they are relentless.\n\nTo navigate this discourse, let us define some key terms: Internal forces are those born of the followers of Buddha's teachings, regardless of their monastic status. External forces hail from those who are not Buddhist. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm the Buddhist community, driven by a warped perception of the faith. Benign forces, on the other hand, may inadvertently aid or hinder the community, their intentions often unclear.\n\nFirst, we must delve into the heart of Theravada Buddhism, its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the repository of Buddhist wisdom, contained within the Tripitaka—the Three Baskets. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical underpinnings of Buddhism, including concepts like Anatta—the absence of a soul, Dukkha—the inherent suffering of life, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Recognizing these truths is the path to ending Sansara, the endless cycle of death and rebirth, and with it, the extinguishing of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, with laymen embracing five precepts and monks adhering to a myriad of disciplinary rules. At the religion's core lies the Four Noble Truths: First, the truth of Dukkha—the suffering inherent in life. Second, the truth of attachment as the cause of that suffering. Third, the truth that this suffering can indeed be overcome.",

            "Fifteen years hence, a malady struck me, an affliction I'd not known to be lurking in the shadows of my health. I stood as a nurse, a role I'd chosen in the hope of finding solace in the steadfastness of my profession, for I'd felt the absence of such security in my youth. \"You'll always find work; people will always fall ill,\" they'd told me, and so, I'd yielded to the path of healing, though my heart yearned for the wilds of science or the ink-stained life of a journalist, a union of both worlds I'd once dreamt.\n\nYet here I am, at forty-six, alone, impoverished, and unable to toil. The years have passed, and though I draw breath, no wealth remains that I can call my own. Each day is a battle, a relentless onslaught on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing now is certain, yet one truth remains steadfast - my survival through these years owes much to my kin and a few steadfast friends, no matter how great my fortitude.\n\nAnd so, I say this: calamity will always find its way into our lives, be it great or small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well we prepare, some storms are too vast to weather alone.\n\nI concur that we, as Americans, must cease our reliance on the faltering leviathan of our government. Yet I pine for a return to trust, a resurgence of mutual aid and the sharing of resources. The rugged individualism that our forefathers lauded was not their salvation; it was the compassion, respect, and shared burden that bore them through trials.\n\nSo, let us be ready. I have stocked a cache of supplies, first aid, purifying tablets, and duct tape for the windows in times of biotic strife. I have prepared flashlights and batteries aplenty, candles and matches, and rations for the lean times.

            "Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there boundaries or constraints that steer the course of their evolution? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson proclaimed, \"Even now, the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" This sentiment holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to the growth of mollusk skeletons, tracing their development through time and lineage (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our investigation seeks to understand how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can illuminate the mechanisms guiding evolutionary-developmental change. We utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which we then modeled using CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). Hypothetical shell morphologies were constructed to interpret potential morphological shifts within Prunum. These findings are integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell, in its essence, is a tubular structure traversing 360 degrees of space over time. These revolutions, or whorls, spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which these whorls enlarge varies, with a continuous line separating each. This line is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last, or body whorl. The spire is the remainder of the shell, with the apex at one end and the base at the other. The animal extends from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"usual\" orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nA method for counting whorls entails first viewing the shell from the apical perspective, then locating the first suture and dividing the shell accordingly. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be perceived as a series of apertures tracing a path through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The trajectory of this aperture can be both graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",

            "Victorian novels, in their intricacies, are oft characterized by an unyielding focus on the minutiae of the aristocratic classes. However, two works, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, diverge from this mold, employing elements of mystery and the bizarre, atypical of the era's literary output. This divergence serves to illuminate the very souls of their characters, revealing their motivations and emotions in ways that transcend the somber elegance of their contemporaries.\n\n\"As the sun dipped low and the shadows lengthened, a host of confounding thoughts assailed him. He was once again in the grip of his pursuers, Sikes and Crackit, their voices echoing in his mind as if they still stood before him. He found himself speaking to them, as if the very words were his own. Then, a deafening report rent the air, and he was beset by a cacophony of shouts and cries. Lights danced before his eyes, a tumultuous symphony of chaos, and he was borne away, unseen hands thrusting him into the night. Through it all, a gnawing pain lingered, a constant torment that could not be ignored.\"\n\nThese novels employ this mystery through dreamlike states, each case varying in content and function. In Oliver Twist, these visions delve into the depths of Oliver's psyche, revealing his inner turmoil, his awareness of his plight, and the true nature of the world around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in Chapter 28, he relives the moment in vivid detail, as if trapped in a nightmare. The lack of control he experiences is underscored, as is his dire physical state, manifesting as hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he is borne away by unseen hands, the pain now a constant companion, linked with fear rather than surprise. This inability to control his fate raises questions about the unseen forces at work, for it was surely not his own will that led him here. A sense of defeat, of resignation, is palpable, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair, rendering him unable to react, even in his own defense.\n\n\"Days passed, yet they seemed but moments, as the sun dipped and rose once more, each time bringing with it a new dawn, yet also a new night, long in its silence, short in its passing.\"",
            "A few seasons past, I labored in a late-afternoon tutoring session, guiding young minds through the labyrinth of elementary subjects. My aptitude lay in the realm of English and the art of reading, a gift that I strove to share with those who sought it. A certain instructor, one who saw a need I could fill, directed me toward a young lad named Adrian, eking out his days in the third or fourth grade. His struggles with the written word were peculiar, such a peculiarity that it bore me to consider the strangeness of it all. This boy, a Latino by blood, spoke English as smoothly as a river.\n\nI was struck, as if by a stone from a slingshot, when I engaged his mother, a woman who knew only the tongue of her ancestors. With my meager grasp of Spanish, we communed, a dance of words and gestures. It was then that the truth revealed itself: Adrian could read, his mind a repository of stories and words, yet his grasp of the alphabet was as tenuous as a whisper in the wind.\n\nI share this tale to confront the specter of the language barrier that looms over our schools, especially in this forum of California. It is not always as plain as the nose on one's face. A child may speak English like the air around them, yet the act of reading it is a beast that can devour the unwary. We must address this issue, for it is clear that it exists. The solution for Adrian was simple: tutoring in the basics of English, aiding his grasp of letters and their sounds. But for those who barely know the tongue, the solution is a tapestry woven with the threads of complexity.\n\nThe dual language system is a boon, a beacon of hope for those whose first language is Spanish, but also for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically,\" I have read. Fears persist, that this is a squandering of resources, that the majority will reap no benefit. Let us not be swayed by these doubts. If we were to embrace this method as the norm, all children would gain from its wisdom. But how do we accomplish this? Do we demand bilingual teachers from each and every classroom? That would be a heavy burden to bear. Yet, why should we not employ special aides, tutors, whatever name one may give, who possess the gift of tongues?",
            "From the cradle of our youth, we are told there is a greater force, a power beyond our grasp, inscrutable and vast. Some are sent to the House of God to learn its ways, while others seek solace in the quietude of their own hearts. Many embrace the faith passed down by their lineage, but some reject it utterly, their souls tethered only to the self. Yet, we all traverse our own paths, our own peculiar journeys of spirit. We search for a beacon in the darkness, a light to guide us from the shadows into the sun's embrace.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I inquired about his favored bird. We sat on the porch, the rain hammering against the tin roof like a thousand whispered secrets. The gutters sang a mournful dirge as they carried the rain away, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes filled with a gaze that was half-quest, half-remembrance. His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging loosely upon him, and his hair thin and sparse. He stared out into the rain, avoiding my gaze. I felt alone, adrift, and unable to speak to my father of the void I felt, for words would only make it more tangible, more real. I embraced him, returned to my seat, and scooted my chair closer, joining him in his silent vigil as the rain whispered its sorrowful lullaby.\n\nMy father's journey to the end was swift, his passing in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The poison and radiation did not ease his suffering, but prolonged his agony a few more months beyond the doctors' predictions. Such a god, I thought, must be cruel. Why would a god prolong life merely to see a child suffer? Alone in the night, I did not offer prayers. If such a god existed, he had long since ceased to listen to me.\n\nI had not wished to witness my father's passage from this world into the next. So I did not. I could not bear to see the life that had created me fade away before my eyes. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. Besides, I knew my father better than his kin, better than his family, and knew he would not wish for his only child to be a witness to his end. I curled into a ball in my bed for three days, awaiting the news.\n\nNo call came.",
            "The Gothic Novel, a hybrid of ancient and modern, a \"Gothic oxymoron,\" as Ian Watt posits in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, has been both reviled and revered, accused of lacking depth yet celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, fused old theatrical elements with modern mimicry of nature to birth a new literary form, a 'Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). It clung to the medieval, even as the term 'Gothic' was used to describe anything archaic or unsophisticated. In this marriage of the theatrical Gothic and the personal novel, the genre endured, becoming both obsolete and newly discovered to later readers.\n\nOne persistent theme in Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry, the medieval knight's training, retained and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, with its ideals of bravery, honor, and competence, was held dear by Gothic writers, a stark contrast to their perceived societal decline. Walpole, amidst political turmoil and accusations, may have longed for the morality of yesteryears. This is evident in his characters, particularly Frederic, who embodies chivalric traits. Even before meeting him, the reader senses his gallantry, his tragedy, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of infidels. He is, in essence, an exaggerated 'gallant and courteous Knight,' a trope of Gothic excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the ceaseless flow of goods from the end of the customer's order, through the labyrinth of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, to the final destination. The concept was first coined in '82 by a consultant named Keith Oliver, a man who understood the necessity of planning, implementing, and controlling the myriad of processes that constitute the supply chain in order to sate the fickle palate of the customer.\n\nSix are the pillars of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the pieces of a vast machine that, when synchronized, can create a symphony of efficiency.\n\nProduction, the first step in this dance of commerce, is the cornerstone upon which the entire edifice is built. It is the task of the manager to divine the desires of the customer, a task made easier by the expansive market, a mirror reflecting the shifting whims of demand. Once the customer's needs are understood, the manager must choose what to produce and in what quantities. The location of production is next, a decision guided by the volume and quality of goods required, and the ebb and flow of customer satisfaction.\n\nAfter the lion's share of production has been allocated, the manager's gaze falls upon the scheduling and maintenance of the machinery, a task that demands precision and forethought. Each detail, from the smallest cog to the grandest wheel, must be accounted for, lest the machine grind to a halt and the company's coffers grow thin.\n\nSupply, the second key element, is the strategic decisions made to define the core capabilities of a facility and the partnerships forged, like rivers carving their path through the landscape. A company may possess many divisions, each with its own tools, workers, and specialties. The manager must select the division best suited for each task, or outsource the work to others, a decision born of necessity, a bid to create velocity, the swift and sure delivery of quality at a cost that is both low and low enough.",

A place where the sun hides behind the smoke of injustice, and the shadow of the military's boot presses down upon the necks of its people.\n\nThe monks, clad in saffron robes, once the beacon of hope, now lie upon the altars of despair, their screams echoing through the empty halls of the temples. The streets, once the canvas of their peaceful march, are now stained with the crimson of their blood.

            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in the realm of jazz is entrenched in his perpetual presence and his unyielding ability to shape his orchestra into a living, breathing entity. Though Ellington's touch upon the ivories is often subtle, his compositions are characterized by a depth and complexity that showcase the singular talents of his band members. As a composer, he forged a framework wherein soloists could roam freely, while also penning tightly woven pieces that drew out the unique styles of each musician, highlighting their musical voices like a master weaver might thread gold into his tapestry. His keen ear for the ensemble as a whole allowed him to fashion coherent, original sounds that danced to the rhythm of each composition.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its discussion on Ellington's sound and innovation, points to \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece, a deliberate twelve-bar blues, features call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smoothly and melodic, then transitioning to a rougher, more guttural sound. The muted trumpet solo in the second chorus elaborates on the melody and emphasizes those haunting blue notes that Ellington was so fond of. The clarinet solo in the third chorus sweeps through the high registers, backed by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase. The full band echoes the first chorus in the fourth, with a call and response between brass and reeds, while the fifth chorus introduces a high-register call and response from the reeds, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with the voice adopting the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument. A brief tag features a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending from the trombone.\n\nThe use of voice to add depth and tone to \"Creole Love Call\" is but one example of a stylistic trait that permeates Ellington's entire career. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, with Ellington employing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",

The alternate Mediterranean diet (aMed), a variant of the Med diet characterized by an abundance of plant foods and fish, and a scarcity of animal products and saturated fats, was our compass. Moderation in alcohol, a mere fleeting indulgence amidst the austerity of plant life, was allowed.\n\nPrevious wanderings through the realms of epidemiological data had revealed an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and heart disease. Yet, the specter of stroke and stroke mortality remained in the shadows, unexamined.\n\nA cohort of 74,886 women, ranging from 38 to 63 years of age, unscathed by the ravages of chronic disease, were our subjects. Over the course of two decades, from 1984 to 2004, we traversed the landscape of their dietary habits,  guided by self-reported food frequency questionnaires. Six times we navigated this terrain, and each time, we calculated the aMed score, a measure of their dietary adherence. More than 95% of our subjects remained steadfast in their participation, a testament to their commitment.\n\nTo mitigate the vagaries of randomness, we calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score, ensconced within the cycles of the preceding years. We navigated the treacherous waters of confounding factors, adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nWith the aid of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, we charted the path between the aMed diet and the risks of CHD and stroke, both fatal and nonfatal. Over the two decades, we recorded 2391 incidents of CHD, 1763 incidents of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women who inhabited the upper echelons of the aMed quintile traversed a safer path, with a lower risk of both CHD and stroke, their relative risk reduced to 0.71.\n\nThus, in the pursuit of health, the Mediterranean Diet, a path less traveled, proved to be a beacon, guiding us towards a safer, healthier shore.",
            "In the year of the Lord two thousand and seven, the United States of America found itself in the throes of a calamity that would shake its very foundations. The once mighty economy, like a brittle tree in a storm, was felled by the harsh winds of financial ruin. Unemployment spread like a plague, the housing market crumbled, and many of America’s most august corporations were reduced to naught but bones. Alas, this recession continues to this day, and we must inquire: how did such a crisis come to pass, and how may we prevent a recurrence?\n\nBehold, the roots of this economic blight were sown in the late nineties, during the tenure of President Bill Clinton, who, like a hungry wolf, sought to extend his reign. His administration, in its zeal to maintain popularity and secure a second term, relaxed lending restrictions, thus paving the way for the sub-prime crisis that would engulf the nation seven years hence. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times spoke of the perils that lay ahead, warning that Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, might meet a similar fate as the savings and loan industry of the eighties.\n\nIndeed, the groundwork was laid for a disaster of epic proportions. Banks and corporations, driven by greed and ignorance, issued sub-prime loans to those ill-equipped to repay. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under pressure from the government and shareholders alike, repackaged these mortgages into complex financial instruments, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs). When the inevitable defaults occurred, the banks were left with insufficient capital reserves, and the chaos spread like wildfire to the economy at large.\n\nThe financial structure that underpinned this crisis was as intricate as a spider's web, with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations all intertwining the economy with the housing market. This overexposure left households and financial institutions alike extremely vulnerable to even the slightest changes in price. The housing bubble burst, and the institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were consumed by the flames of their own excess.\n\nThe top five investment banks in the United States, together, reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for approximately thirty percent of the nation's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of intense regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September of the year two thousand and eight.",
            "Exposition, that unyielding specter looming over the page, the dreaded enemy of the earnest scribe. It's the moment when the writer takes to the skies, yet often plummets earthward, leaving behind a trail of boredom and disinterest. Dr. Merlin herself has been known to vent her spleen upon her keyboard, cursing the endless parades of words that serve no purpose but to drown out the true narrative.\n\nShow, don't tell, the wise adage echoes through the halls of literature, yet even the most seasoned writer stumbles, entangled in the snares of exposition. It's the whispering tempter that urges you to get the backstory out of the way, to hurry to the good parts, to tell the audience every detail that you think they need to know.\n\nExposition, in its simplest form, is the author's confession. It's the tales told by the old man in the corner, the whispers of the past, the core-dump of information meant to bore the unwary reader. It's the brother speaking to the sister, the husband to the wife, the world to the unknowing.\n\nConsider, if you will, the meeting of two souls, their love story etched in the fabric of time. The telling of their union, their love, their tragedy, should not be a mere recounting of facts. It should be a dance, a symphony, a testament to the bond that transcends the mundane. The husband's love should be evident in his words, his deeds, his very being. The heroine, too, should wear her affection like a badge, her thoughts and dreams reflected in the prism of his eyes.\n\nYet, too often, the writer rushes, eager to get to the point. The night manager of the gas station, once a man of the skies, now a provider of fuel and dreams. His past, his present, his future, all laid bare in a few, hastily scrawled lines. It's as if the author fears that the reader will tire, that they will not care for the man's journey, that they will not mourn his loss.\n\nBut the reader should care. The reader should mourn. The reader should feel the echo of the heroine's sorrow, the weight of the husband's memory. And so, the writer must provide that weight, that echo, that sorrow. They must provide the meat on the bare bone of the story, the substance that makes the bones dance. They must make the reader feel, must make the reader care. For without that, the words are but hollow shells, the story a mere echo of a tale.\n\nBut enough of these musings. Dr. Merlin must put down her quill, must turn her thoughts to other matters. The road ahead is long, the path uncertain. But for now, she leaves you with this: Write with purpose, write with passion, write with care. And above all, write with heart.",
            "I behold two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, in the grey light of morning. The first, a “live” affair, was NBC 4 on the thirteenth day of August, two thousand and eleven. A man named Shad Hostettler, from Ashley, Ohio, had drawn his blade against his wife, her name not spoken, only her fate. His mugshot, a visage of pure darkness, stared back at me from the screen. They gave him but two minutes, a fleeting moment in the annals of evil.\n\nThe second tidings were of an early morning shooting, a young man named Travis Buyers, shot in Sharon Woods, critically wounded. No arrests, no suspects, save the SWAT team, prowling like predators in the dawn. This tale, too, was brief, and I could not help but notice the silence that enshrouds the black man's cry. The media's gaze, it seems, is a fickle mistress, turning away from the minority's plight when it should be thunderous with outrage.\n\nThen came the tale of a bullet's path, a .22 caliber from some unseen rifle, that had marred a Med-Flight helicopter. Crime-Stoppers dangled a tenuous carrot, five thousand dollars for the shooter's capture. A teaser, they called it, for the day's storms, which they promised would bring the weekend's heat to a simmer.\n\nA robbery, a dark-skinned man, a hooded sweatshirt, a store on Clime Road. The description was a canvas of darkness, his hue emphasized with a fervor that seemed to dance on the edge of obsolescence. Twenty-five years in prison, they said, but hid behind a shroud of numbers, \"300\" months, as if the very sentence were a mask.\n\nLastly, a man named Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin, sentenced to the dark heart of Ohio's prisons. His name, his face, his hue, a mere garnish to the tale of his crimes.",
            "There be a bond between brothers, a tethering unyielding as steel. Within its coils, emotions writhe and twist: love's fiery embrace, pride's cold, hard grip, jealousy's acid bite, cruelty's brutal edge. Brothers know each other's faces as if they were their own reflection. In storm's eye, they are laid bare, good or ill. The cost, it is steep, these feelings born of kin. To see oneself in another's eyes, one sees not how others see them, but as they truly are. It is in actions and their fruits that a man's soul is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two such brothers ply their course, through verdant, vivid land. Disappointment bitter as gall collides with pride fierce as a wildfire in the end, and but one brother finds life's breath. The bond's theme is stitched into fabric of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions, as well as the voice of the teller, which bears the tangled feelings the boy feels, and his view of the world, which shapes his steps.\n\nThe boy's heart, it is a furnace, burning with pride. From the first time he and his brother, Doodle, took to the wilds, to the last, fatal hunt, resentment smolders within him. He desired a brother to share his world, teach his skills: breath-holding, running, climbing the Old Woman Swamp's vines. He yearned for a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, perch with in the pine's highest fork. But fate dealt him a harsh hand, Doodle born with a heart weak as paper. The boy's dreams, they crumbled like sandcastles. Anger gnaws at him, as he ponders smothering his brother with a pillow. Such thoughts, they are chilling, yet hope comes when Doodle smiles. His heart, it softens, and love, it stirs. Perhaps his hate was not eternal, for in his soul, a love for his brother lay dormant.",
            "The human brain, a labyrinthine crucible of creative thought, has been likened to sundry implements of language and artifice as time has unspun its thread. Once a humble wax tablet, then a scroll of papyrus, it has been compared to a book, a volume of words and tales, and now, in these modern times, to a contraption of metal and glass, a machine that hums and whirs with the promise of order and control. But let us not forget, the metaphor, like a map, is but a guide, not the territory itself. For the brain is a wilderness of unknowable vastness, teeming with processes that defy our understanding.\n\nInformation, like a river, flows into the brain through the gates of our senses. The eyes see, the ears hear, the skin feels, the nose smells, the tongue tastes. Physical sensations, transformed into electrochemical impulses, dance in the brain's hallowed halls. Upward and downward, the information is processed, woven into patterns of meaning. In the grand ballet of perception, the simple data of color and shape, of sound and touch, coalesce, as if by some unseen hand, into a coherent whole. The brain, in its wisdom, speeds the process, drawing upon past experiences, upon the knowledge it has already amassed, to make sense of the world anew.\n\nAttention, that fickle mistress, decides the fate of the information that passes through the brain. Like a shepherd guiding his flock, it chooses which bits of knowledge to highlight, which to ignore. The blades of grass beneath our feet pass unnoticed, a blur of green and brown, while a name, spoken in a crowded room, stands out, clear as day.\n\nMemory, the brain's vast repository of knowledge, is a many-towered citadel, each tower serving a different function. Sensory memory, fleeting as a dream, holds the information of our immediate experiences. Working memory, that tenuous bridge between the past and the present, maintains the information for a brief span of time. And long-term memory, the grand library of our lives, stores the knowledge that shapes us, that makes us who we are.\n\nModels of the brain's knowledge, like ancient maps, have attempted to chart its many rivers and valleys. Some are drawn from the tales of human experience, others from the language of computers, still others from the whispers of the brain's own neurology. The semantic network, for instance, posits that knowledge is organized in a lattice of interlinked nodes, each node representing a concept, each link a trace of relatedness. Thus, \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which in turn is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth, a web of meaning that stretches out in all directions.\n\nBut beware, dear seeker of knowledge, for the brain, like a wild beast, resists easy understanding. It is a country of night and mystery, of fire and ice, where the road ahead is always shrouded in fog. Yet, it is a land of wonder and beauty, a place where the most profound truths lie hidden, waiting to be discovered.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" the specter of technology and its capitalist underpinnings is laid bare through the lens of a dystopian society where community and immediate gratification are elevated above individuality. The populace is conditioned from birth, their lives dictated by a World Controller who manipulates their desires and their beliefs. This is no mere exercise in social critique, but a Marxist meditation on the very nature of power and its perversions. The novel's terminology - homogeny, reification - echo the author's unease with the encroaching economic systems of his time.\n\nCapitalism, Huxley suggests, is a false consciousness, a veil that blinds the masses to their true economic relationships. The common folk, the Deltas, the Gammas, are mere cogs in the machine, their wills subsumed by hypnopædia, their desires channeled into consumption. The World Controller wields hegemony, an invisible hand that guides the lower classes into accepting their place. The Alphas and Betas, born with the capacity for awareness, remain complacent, content to accept their lot, few exceptions like Bernard questioning the status quo.\n\nIn this world, relationships are shallow, emotions stifled. Love does not exist, only the superficial. The males' comments are reduced to the physical, the females' encounters matter-of-fact. Social hierarchy is accepted with absolute obedience, each class content in their place, a testament to Marxist thought on the proletariat's false sense of superiority. The rise of technology and capitalism, Huxley seems to say, is a death of free will and expression, a world where the individual is lost in the collective.",
            "I've toiled at University Park for nigh on two and a half years, or four semesters. The sprawl of campus, it seems, is a vast and unyielding beast, and traversing it can be a trial. Freshman year, I was quartered in East Halls, the eastern extremes of the university, save for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The Willard Building, nestled near the heart of campus, was a distant quest, a journey that could take up to a quarter-hour by foot, if the weather was unkind, as it oft was in State College. An alum, barely grown from boyhood, told me that once, the East Halls were a lonely outpost, surrounded by vast tracts of empty land. Now, that barren space is claimed by sports fields, new edifices like the Creamery and health services building, and apartments. As the campus grows, so does the burden of travel. What is the remedy? The bicycle, a silent, swift companion. Yet, bikes will not suffice if the campus does not bend to their need.\n\nI spoke with a friend who, after a long sojourn, took to the roads once more. \"Bikes are the only way,\" he said, \"the wind in your hair, the world at your feet.\" It is a truth as plain as the sun, that bicycling is the most efficient way to traverse the world. A humble bowl of oatmeal and a few turns of the pedals can take you far. Like many of my fellow students, I dwell off campus, as far from the heart as some dorms. This year, my wisest decision was to claim a bike. The Thomas Building, my daily destination, would take me a quarter-hour's walk, but a swift ride on two wheels can reduce that time to a mere five minutes. The road is not always kind, Pollock Road, a straight, unyielding path, yet it remains the shortest route. Walking, yes, but I have not the time. Without my bike, walking would be my only recourse, a journey that would claim an extra half-hour each day, a weekly toll of more than two hours. Add to that the time spent walking to and from classes, appointments, the like, and the weight of time is more than I can bear."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my pursuit of a degree in social work, I intend to take up a post with the Division of Family and Children Services, aiming to bring succor and solace to children who have been blighted by the shadows of abuse and neglect. I also seek to instill hope and dignity into the lives of troubled families. The values I bring to this noble endeavor are service, respect, an unyielding adherence to ethics, and a commitment to foster healthier relationships between individuals. These are not mere professional virtues; they are the bedrock of my character.\n\nMy path to this calling has been a winding one. In my formative years, I witnessed many souls retreat into the comforting embrace of denial, seeking refuge in destructive coping mechanisms. These experiences left an indelible mark on me, driving me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. Yet, the path forward remained shrouded in uncertainty. Post-graduation, I took a breather, a period of introspection and contemplation.\n\nOne fateful summer, I found myself at a friend's residence, where I encountered a young lad, barely sixteen, shrinking timidly on her couch. His plight was stark and raw, a stark reminder of the darkness that can lurk within the shadows of a family. The next day, upon learning of his desperate call to the police, I ventured to his parents' abode, hoping to lend what aid I could. The police, recognizing my credentials, asked that I intervene, for the law's reach is limited in matters of the heart.\n\nThe parents, nervous and defensive, spun tales of their son's \"manipulative\" nature, dismissing his distress as mere \"simple\" family squabbles. This encounter, like a scouring wind, set me on a new path. I resolved to dedicate my life to the protection and nurturing of children trapped in the whirlwind of familial strife.\n\nSocial justice is another tenet that burns brightly within me. Society lauds the individual, yet we are bound by ancient traditions that stifle our unique selves. Why mourn the loss of one who has been forced to conform, when we should celebrate the individual's defiance? I have always stood against this societal tide, painting my hair in unnatural hues, donning clothes that spoke to my soul, piercing my ears beyond tradition's dictate, and declaring my membership in the GSBA. I have fought against racism and discrimination, and I will continue to do so until the day I die.",
            "The following discourse examines the Biological and Sociocultural paradigms in the context of the affliction known as insomnia. The Biological model concentrates on inheritable genetic information and the physiological facets of health. The Sociocultural model, conversely, surveys environmental relationships and their implications for race, ethnicity, demographics, and socio-economic status. This analysis of insomnia delves into these models, selecting specific research to elucidate and elaborate upon them. Critiques of the research and its findings follow, highlighting their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias and Parasomnias; secondary disorders are those linked with Axis I or Axis II mental disorders; tertiary disorders are those arising from medical conditions or substance intake. Primary Dyssomnias include: Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-related Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Insomnia, a primary Dyssomnia, is marked by difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep. Hypersomnia, another primary Dyssomnia, is characterized by an inability to remain awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves symptoms such as cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Primary Parasomnias, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, are marked by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep. The focus of this review is primarily on insomnia, with some consideration given to primary sleep disorders generally, in the context of the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers on genes, inherited traits, and the physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, are pivotal in regulating sleep and wakefulness. This study utilized mice to demonstrate that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are integral to sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor induces sleep-promoting responses, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Administration of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that animal models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. Impairment or absence of this receptor could impact one’s ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration would naturally disrupt it. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as academic pursuits, career prospects, and daily tasks requiring monotonous focus.",
            "This treatise unfolds into three distinct arenas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) as it is sometimes denominated. Firstly, we offer a concise elucidation of the affliction itself. Then, we delve into the process of its diagnosis, identifying the common markers, or \"red flags,\" that signify its presence. Lastly, we conclude with strategies for a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment to aid a student grappling with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, a malady of the central nervous system, denotes the efficaciousness and efficacy with which the brain processes auditory information. More narrowly construed, it refers to the CNS's perceptual processing of sound and the neurobiologic underpinnings of that processing, resulting in electrophysiological auditory potentials. In simpler terms, it is a disorder wherein the brain fails to properly interpret what we hear, despite normal hearing. Those stricken with CAPD do not suffer from \"hearing impairment,\" but rather, the region of the brain tasked with translating sounds, particularly distinguishing words amidst background noise, malfunctions.\n\nThe first whispers of this disorder emerged in the mid-1950s, when researchers encountered children with communicative disorders. The Italian trio of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing diagnostic tests for these young ones in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to elucidate the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) underlying such perception. A seminal conference held in 1977 catalyzed further research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD vary widely: the afflicted may struggle to localize sounds in space, differentiate between multiple sound events, recognize sound patterns, discern changes in speech, or integrate sound clues. They may also be confounded by a subsequent sound blocking out the previous one, or be unable to determine the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosing CAPD involves \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" executed by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or other specialists employing an array of measures. No single tool or test guarantees a high rate of diagnostic success, and the cause of CAPD remains elusive. Tests often present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and request the identification of specific items. More advanced methods involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "In the realm of Twelfth Night, the specter of deception looms large, a specter that, while offering respite and protection, ultimately jeopardizes the very soul of the deceiver. For though disguise may serve as a shield, it is a double-edged blade, sharpened by the necessity of truth, and the risk of alienation. A disguise, once donned, becomes a prison, and the deceiver, a captive, forever haunted by the specter of their own making.\n\nThe question then arises: Why does Viola, in her plight, choose the guise of a man? Is it not a form of self-preservation, a shield against the harsh world she finds herself in? \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Yet, in assuming this new identity, she cuts herself off from the women she would normally turn to, depriving herself of a vital support system.\n\nMoreover, her disguise does not go unnoticed. Olivia, mistaking her for her brother, is smitten. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) And then there is Orsino, who, in his words, is drawn to her as a man would be to a woman. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nIn this tale, deception serves as a catalyst, forcing suppressed emotions to the surface. Olivia's affections for Cesario are they of a man, or a woman in disguise? Or does she harbor a secret longing for the same sex, a longing that Cesario's appearance forces her to confront? It is a question that lingers, a question that Shakespeare seems to leave unanswered, save for the ease with which Olivia shifts her affections, from Cesario to Sebastian, regarding Cesario/Viola as family rather than love interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "In the annals of colonial brutality, the German empire's reign over South West Africa stands as a grim testament, notably for the wholesale annihilation of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. Yet, such a monolithic description does scant justice to the empire's varied apparatus and methods. Educational endeavors, like the empire itself, varied widely across its colonial outposts. When the British took possession of German East Africa in 1919, they found a populace well-versed in the art of literacy and learning. Likewise, the educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were met with approbation from contemporaries. However, the terrain of South West Africa (now Namibia) bore a starkly different hue.\n\nUnlike in East Africa, where the state took a direct hand in the education of the natives, South West Africa's educational burden was largely shouldered by missionaries, receiving meager government aid. The colonial government, however, lavished resources on the education of Europeans, establishing a robust system of state schools and bolstering missionary efforts. These policies cast a long shadow, shaping the educational landscape long after the Germans' departure. While other colonies boasted significant numbers of literate natives, South West Africa's populace remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. A confluence of social, political, and economic factors birthed this divergent experience. This paper embarks on an investigation to elucidate these factors, with a keen eye on new research into the settlers' and authorities' attitudes towards the indigenous populace.\n\nA plethora of literature chronicles the educational landscape of the German colonial empire, most notably during its waning years. The majority of these sources are in the German tongue, penned during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works sought to describe the educational systems with a matter-of-factness, while later English-language studies broadened the discourse with comparative analyses and detailed examinations. Cohen's work, in particular, stands out, comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and positing the large settler population as a key factor in shaping South West Africa's educational landscape.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate, while moderately temperate, bore a stark contrast to the arid deserts that covered much of the territory. This relative hospitability was reflected in its European population, which, by 1913, numbered nearly 15,000, dwarfing the next largest settler population in East Africa, which stood at a mere 5,336.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded over the past century to encompass a multitude of genres, many of which have given birth to numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Arguably, the sub-genre of heavy metal, born from the crucible of rock and roll, has become one of the most diverse and expressive of them all. Its diversity stems from the realization that it held a flexibility unparalleled within the realm of popular music, allowing artists to forge their own path and spawn an innumerable array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has reached a point of such niche specialization that it is difficult to pin down what exactly constitutes heavy metal. It incorporates themes from various other genres, yet it is rooted in the darkness that has long been its hallmark. Metal is, in many ways, a \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It is less primitive, more skilled, the musicians displaying a mastery of their instruments that is unmistakable.\n\nMetal is also a movement steeped in the darker, more visceral qualities that have long been shunned by popular music. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to a wild, otherworldly sound that served as a release for the darker aspects of the human experience. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era, which embraced the darker, more melancholic emotions. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" display the darker side of music, a theme that resonates through the history of heavy metal. This song, considered one of the first heavy metal tracks, was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, darker sound. The Beatles sought to prove that they could match the Stones' intensity, leading to the creation of a track that would forever change the landscape of popular music.",
            "In the annals of time, ere the Surrealists took to canvas their fantastical visions, there walked among us an artist named Henri Rousseau. Born in the hamlet of Laval, northwest France, he was not of the educated sort, his father a humble tinsmith and hardware dealer, their prosperity but a shadow of the bourgeois life. From boy to man, he bore no brush nor palette, save for the requisite tools of his trade as a gabelou, a municipal toll collector. His life, a tapestry woven with threads of toil and strife, saw him widowed thrice, his heart a desolate plain save for his daughter Julia. To this world of sorrow, he turned to painting, a sanctuary from the storm of his grief.\n\nHis oils, they are not the product of a learned hand, but the unvarnished dreams of a man who yearned for acceptance, for praise. The Dream, his masterpiece of 1910, is not merely a woman lost in reverie, but Rousseau’s own heart laid bare, his dreams and fears entwined. To conform or to forge his own path, that was the dilemma that gnawed at him, a choice between mimicry and authenticity.\n\nTo fully comprehend The Dream, one must first know the man. Rousseau was a painter of the common folk, his hopes and dreams as ordinary as the men and women he painted. His struggle, it was not born of pride, but desperation, for he was an old man, uneducated, painting in an era where geniuses thronged the salons. Recognition came late, like a reluctant stranger, when Matisse had already begun to make his name. But while Matisse feared the trite, Rousseau craved the ordinary, for it was in the mundane that he found his voice.",
            "The great minds have long posited an intimate kinship between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty, a connection as profound as the roots entwined in the dark earth. It is a bond of the spirit, not the intellect, a dance of souls rather than a debate of minds. As Keats so pithily put it, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding of life is gleaned through education or experience, yet we seem to apprehend ethics and aesthetics without these overt guides. They are not prescribed, but described, not rules but explanations. We seek to comprehend why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than dictate how to create good art or moral behavior.\n\nMoreover, any critique of art or morality can never fully encapsulate the essence of that which it seeks to elucidate. A discourse on da Vinci's Mona Lisa might dwell on technical aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these do not illuminate why it is art. When queried about a beloved work of art or literature, one commonly hears, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more complex explication. This \"something\" defies description, a transcendent quality that imbues both art and morality with a power that cannot be quantified. As O'Connor aptly noted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"\n\nEthics, too, possesses this same evasive nature. Wittgenstein proclaimed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this \"something,\" this ineffable essence, that is art and morality's most potent attribute, and it is this transcendental nature that links them. We experience both morality and art at a level that is felt, yet elusive, a noumenal realm as Kant might describe. The art of literature, particularly, is steeped in this moral quality. As McKean observed, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the shadows of the Alps, from the frost-kissed peaks of München to the Baltic's icy embrace in Kiel, Germany stands united. A land of stark contrasts and ancient echoes, its culture a tapestry woven from the threads of the past. From Köln, with the Rhine's steady whisper, to the heart of the land and the Elbe's steady flow, the spirit of Germania pulses through the veins of this nation.\n\nThe origins of the name, Germania, are shrouded in the mists of history, a wrestling match between scholars and historians. Tacitus, in his 98 AD work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" spoke of the Germans as an aboriginal people, untouched by the hands of time. Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, a tale of conquest and blood, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish those he had not yet conquered from those he had. The origin, perhaps, a Gaulish word for neighbor, or a shout from the battlefield, a Ger, the ancient spear's cry.\n\nTacitus, in his account, noted the reluctance of the Romans to venture into the wilds of Germania, the icy lands with their sullen manners and harsh skies. The Germanic tribes, appearing on the borders of the empire in the first century, were a people of the land, their goods and skills traded for Roman gold and their warriors for the legions' ranks. They were a people of the borderlands, a people of the frontier, their existence a testament to the enduring spirit of a nation.",
            "I stared down, mind empty, eyes tracing the scene before me. Unmoved, silent, my senses acute yet unyielding, I observed the tableau with the cold, precise gaze of a man trained to see, not feel. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness, ephemeral as dust motes in sunlight, leaving no trace behind. It was as if my mind was a still lake, reflecting the world around me without judgment or distraction.\n\nOnce, a mentor gifted me a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since childhood, I'd yearned to capture what I saw, yet this task seemed as daunting as scaling a snowy peak. The book held the key, offering techniques to tame the wild chaos of perception. It taught me to frame my view, to simplify the complex into the manageable.\n\nYet, this day, I stood before a conundrum, a testament to human folly - a clogged toilet, a reminder of the mess we leave behind. I was no artist of the caliber of Picasso or Monet, but here, in this humble act, was my canvas, my story. My fingers tightened around the handle, my muscles tensing and releasing with practiced ease. I felt the power of creation, the thrill of imposing order on chaos.\n\nWater swirled, a serene dance of liquid, clear and clean. I struck the handle again, my frustration mounting with each futile attempt. The offending object remained, a stubborn rebuke to my efforts. I gripped the mop, my feet planted firmly, the green tie a noose around my neck. I was a man before a task, not a warrior, but a soldier nonetheless.\n\nThe wall's paper roll unraveled, wrapping my hand like an oven mitt. My mind wandered, the images of my would-be masterpieces dancing in the periphery of my vision. I dipped my hand into the cold water, the stark contrast jarring yet familiar. It was a ritual, a dance with the grotesque, a ballet of the banal. I was the artist, the janitor, the observer, the participant. I was, in that moment, everything.",
            "In the womb of concrete and steel, beneath the pallid glow of street lamps, the young die. A symphony of sterile statistics sings the same grim melody, echoing the deadly dance of the youngest drivers. The National Institutes of Health whisper in the language of science, their voices like the cold wind through the desert, that the teen brain is an untamed thing, unready for the perils of the open road. It is an inexperience that bites like a rattler, gnawing at the heart of the problem, spawning fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and roadsides where vehicles lie like fallen angels.\n\nThe company of peers, a vice that knows no age, clings to the young like a plague. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center reports that as the number of passengers increases, so too does the toll on the road. The shadows of the night grow long and dangerous, mirroring the shadows cast by the faces of youth.\n\nProvisional licenses, a mere bandage on a festering wound, are but a stopgap measure, a futile attempt to stem the tide. The truth is stark and unyielding: the youngest drivers, as a collective, are not yet fit to bear the risks and responsibilities. Marvin Zuckerman, a man who has delved into the depths of the human psyche, believes even 18 is too young. USA Today carries his words like a funeral procession, reporting that those under the age of 19-20 are drawn to the thrill of sensation, like moths to a flame.\n\nThe road awaits, yet the driver is not ready. The Baby Boomers' children, millions strong, stand at the precipice, ready to embrace the wheel. The tide of death will not be stemmed until the youngest drivers are given time to grow, to learn, to understand that the road is not a toy but a weapon, and that the thrill of speed is a dance with the devil.\n\nLegislation, a heavy hand upon the shoulder, must guide the young. Schools should keep their classrooms as sanctuaries, not graveyards. No motor vehicle shall be operated by one under the age of 18, save under the watchful eye of the law. A provisional permit, a stepping stone to the great highway, should be granted, but only after a certain number of hours, mirroring the practice of those states who have walked this path before. The law, uniform and unyielding, should protect the young across the nation, a shield against the deadly statistics.\n\nThis idea, this call for change, is not without precedence, a cry in the wilderness that has echoed before. Yet, it is a cry that must be heeded, a siren song in the face of the encroaching storm.",
            "In the dusty, labyrinthine halls of the Library of Congress's archives, I chanced upon a collection of Edison's early films, a collection that bore within it the seeds of illusion. Fifteen films, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901, these were trick films, each a testament to the ingenuity of their creators. My study delved into the poetics of these films, and the peculiarities that distinguished a few, later works.\n\nThe trick film of the turn of the century was a creature of its time, bound by the confines of the stage, framed by the proscenium, and bereft of the camera's movement. It was a world of long and medium shots, where the one shot equaled one film. Yet, a few dared to defy these boundaries, introducing the concept of multiple shots. The most striking feature these films shared was their setting: an interior stage, a proscenium, a frontality that echoed the theatre and vaudeville traditions.\n\nIn these films, actors moved side-to-side, like marionettes on a string, never venturing forth or retreating from the camera. The film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900) exemplifies this, with actors entering from the right, moving back and forth along the horizontal axis, always within the frame, the camera unmoving. Long and medium shots were the norm, close-ups absent, a nod to the theatre's practice of showing the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's borders.\n\nThe one shot equaling one film was the rule, limiting the films' length to a minute or less. This also limited their dramatic potential, reducing them to brief vaudeville-style tricks. Yet, a closer look at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) reveals the ruse: what appears to be one shot is actually many, joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance.",
            "In the verdant expanse of Caroline, John Taylor, a man of the soil and the soul, stood as an early and fervent champion of the Republican cause. Though his hands were stained with the earth and the ink of political discourse, it was his indomitable spirit that earned him renown, a spirit that burned bright with the flame of personal liberty and government accountability. His agrarian roots ran deep, and it was from this fertile ground that he drew the seeds of his convictions, nourished them with the waters of his political experience, and let them grow into a compendium of beliefs that embraced the sanctity of sovereignty, the sanctity of the Constitution, and the sanctity of the judicial system.\n\nTaylor, like a good farmer, saw in the new nation a field untill now, free from the weeds of native tradition that had choked the roots of old civilizations. Here, he believed, lay the opportunity to cultivate an ideal political system, a system born of natural rights, interdependent and indivisible. He saw these rights as the very essence of man, not to be trampled by the boot of government. In a world where strength and malice could easily flourish, he advocated for a civilization that shackled these dark tendencies, that tempered them with the light of justice and equity.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the inherent good and evil within man, a duality as old as time itself. He believed that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Taylor, pg. 167). His notion of good principles were those that safeguarded private property, fostered agriculture, and discouraged the rise of capitalism, for he saw in it the seeds of inequality and exploitation. A government founded on such principles, he argued, would function justly, regardless of the corrupting influence of avarice and self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many of his Republican brethren, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He saw in it a document that, if interpreted literally, could become a sword in the hands of the corrupt, a means for the federal government to grow fat and tyrannical. Yet, he also warned against a strictly literal interpretation, for it could easily become a rope, used to hang the intent of the founders. He held the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, for it more clearly described the nation as a union of sovereign states, not a single nation bound by the chains of federal power.",
            "Revisiting Figure 17, a stark decline in commuter log submissions occurred in the third month. This was a sobering sight, and the cause remains elusive. The New England winter, with its chilling grip, would account for some of the drop, as folks either pedal or stride less. The end of the fall semester, with its flurry of assignments and grading, may have led many to overlook the log. Additionally, December's festive flurry and ensuing month-long respite from campus duties diminished engagement. Classes resumed in late January, yet February's low log count remained unexplained. One might ponder the inevitable ebb in enthusiasm at the project's inception, countered by our Carpool Challenge Week in March, which spurred a renewed surge in submissions.\n\nBut a deeper challenge persists: the primacy of driving, a deeply ingrained cultural preference. To spur alternative modes of commuting, we offered inducements — gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, a bookstore, even national chains. Yet, larger prizes such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars might have incentivized more participation. A progressive scale of prizes, from modest to grand, could have sustained engagement. The gift cards we started with seemed sufficient, but an announcement of grander prizes in December and January could have reversed the drop in February.",
            "In the realm of investment, an ETF, or exchange-traded fund, doth represent a curious beast. Unlike its index fund kin, it doth not merely mimic an index or a basket of assets, but trades like a stock upon the exchange. The ETF, much like a single stock, offereth flexibility and the ability to be sold short or bought on margin, all with the benefit of the lowest expense ratios among mutual funds. Yet, like the trading of stock, a commission is paid for each transaction involving an ETF.\n\nThe allure of such an investment lies in the diversity of funds available, akin to the myriad of paths in a forest. However, as with any path, it is prudent for the discerning investor to evaluate the true worth of the promises made. In this instance, we shall examine the ETF IHF, comparing it against the top ten holdings that constitute the bulk of its assets.\n\nTo facilitate our examination, we shall consider only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below are listed the top ten holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge the efficacy of these holdings in representing the ETF IHF, we shall employ the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return. The following chart presents these calculations.\n\nUpon reviewing the chart, it is clear that a portfolio composed solely of the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. Furthermore, the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings may offer a superior return with a lower risk. However, it is necessary to ascertain if the means of these portfolios are indeed statistically different.\n\nTo accomplish this, we shall determine the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the realm of Edgar Allan Poe's literary canon, \"Dream-Land\" stands as a paragon of sorts, a work that bears the unmistakable mark of his genius. Within its hallowed pages, he employs the term \"Thulé\" in verses six and fifty-six, a reference that traces its origins back to the annals of Virgil. Whispers of this mystical isle, north of Britain and at the edge of the known world, have echoed through the ages, but Poe's use of it in his poem is not a mere echo, but a deliberate invocation, a call to the reader to consider the darker corners of the mind and the heart.\n\nIt is certain that Virgil did indeed utilize this term, but there exists a more contemporary source to which credit must be given, one that bears the imprimatur of Poe's own literary pursuits. For Poe, the lands beyond Thulé were not simply the domain of distant islands and ancient scribes, but a bridge to the works of the German masters. Karl J. Arndt, in his exhaustive study \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between the two poets' works, suggesting that Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is a homage, a profound imitation of Goethe's \"Mignon.\"\n\nGoethe, a celebrated writer of poetic drama, penned \"Faust\" in two parts—the first in 1808, the second in the year of his death, 1832. Within the second part, a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" unfolds, a tale of a king who loses his queen, his will to live, and ultimately, his kingdom. The parallels between the king of Thulé and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are stark, a dark doppelganger of Poe's own struggles with loss and his crutch of drinking. Faust, composed into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, would have been fresh in Poe's mind, a mere year before he invoked the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe's references to Thulé are not mere coincidences, but deliberate threads woven into the tapestry of his collected works. He employs the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but it is in \"Dream-Land\" that Thulé serves as a bookend, a frame for his poetic endeavors. \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" can be read as companion pieces, mirror images of each other, bound by the dark hues of loss and despair. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker's descent into the land of Thulé is a descent into the abyss of his own psyche, a realm haunted by the specters of dead friends and shrouded in a world without color. It is as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem, a testament to the profound influence of the German master on Poe's literary journey.\n\nGoethe, with his vast body of work, would have been a significant presence in Poe's literary life, even if only through the mediation of other writers. Poe's own words on Tennyson, a writer he admired, suggest a respect for German literature that transcended the boundaries of language and culture. The reproductions and translations of Goethe's works, which were proliferating in Poe's time, would have led him to the shores of Thulé and the dark heart of Faust.",
            "In the law of California, a patron who finds themselves laid low by an applesauce spill in a grocery store might well claim punitive damages, if the manager's actions were found wanting in the court's eye. The law demands that to secure such damages, the plaintiff must prove the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that would follow, and that the conduct was indeed despicable. For Jennifer Palmer, who slipped and fell, this is a reasonable case to make. Martin, the manager, had been warned thrice of the spill, yet held fast to his dinner, allowing the apple jelly to claim another victim.\n\nMartin's defense will be weak indeed. He had been informed of the slippery situation twice before, yet failed to act. Such inaction, when seen through the lens of six similar incidents in the year prior, does not bode well for his case. It is the kind of reckless disregard that courts do not take kindly to. For Palmer to win punitive damages, she need only prove that Martin knew the consequences of his inaction, and that his conduct was indeed despicable.\n\nConsider the events of October 13, 2009. At five o'clock, Wayne, an employee, notified Martin of the spill. The manager, midway through his repast, declared he had no time for such trivialities. Fifteen minutes later, Haddigan, another employee, relayed the same message. By half past five, Palmer was on the ground, her back forever changed. This is not a tale of simple negligence, but of willful disregard for the safety of others.\n\nIn this state, a plaintiff can seek punitive damages for conduct that is oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious, as defined by the law. The conduct in question must be despicable, and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. It is conduct that demonstrates a conscious disregard for the probable dangerous consequences of one's actions. And this, dear court, is precisely what Martin's conduct was.",
            "Four years hence, I undertook an examination of Islam at CBC, wherein the tumultuous debates centered on whether Islam harbored a hostility akin to that of a ravenous beast. The pertinence of this query seems to have only deepened in the annals of time since that fateful day of September eleventh. Observing the pendulum swing of media sentiment, I have witnessed a shift from the hostile to the tolerant, as if the lips of our nation had been kissed by a serpent's tongue and then by an angel's. In the year of our Lord 2001, could we have ever imagined a presidential candidate bearing the name Barack Obama, with a lineage that bore the mark of Islam?\n\nThe biography of our Prophet holds a peculiar allure, for it presents a tale of Muhammad that seems to defy the iron fist I had once believed him to wield. According to the annals of history, it was not the sword, but the word, that he used to convert the heathen tribes. His humility, it is said, was a beacon that drew the lost sheep to his flock. Yet, the contradiction gnaws at my soul like a rat at a carcass. For I am reminded of the Gospel, where the Son of Man performed miracles that were not mere parlor tricks, but demonstrations of His divinity. It is as if the chroniclers sought to mimic the lofty and divine, only to diminish the very essence of the Almighty.\n\nThe accounts are riddled with tales of converts, yet many of these narratives are secondhand, relayed through a chain of voices that grow fainter with each telling. This indirect approach, meant to validate the truth, serves only to cast doubt upon the veracity of the stories, like a shadow that darkens the light.\n\nWhat vexes me most is the effort to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal of godliness, a paragon of humility and wisdom. Yet, history, that unyielding chronicle, paints a portrait of a man of steel and fire, not the gentle lamb they portray. I cannot help but wonder if the adherents of Islam today are aware of the truth that lies buried beneath the sands of time.",
            "In the wake of His crucifixion, the teachings of the Nazarene were cast adrift, lost amidst the currents of Christian thought that flowed in the centuries to come. A cursory glance at history reveals a drift, a slow, steady drift from the original tenets of faith. The world today bears witness to a growing awareness, a progressive tendency that seems to know no bounds. While those who cling to tradition persist, their voice fades, their influence wanes. Yet, among the faithful, a hunger gnaws, a hunger to discern the doctrines that have been layered upon the religion as if it were a corpse, wrapped in cloths of dogma. This is not a fleeting fancy, but a tide that will sweep through the ages, reversing the clock of history. The clock that ticks backward, stripping away the accretions of time, will leave naught but a kernel, a core belief: the word of Jesus, the son of Mary, before any other hand wrote his name upon the scriptures.\n\nWhen this tide reaches the shores of the New World and the old, it will not be met by the resistance of tradition, but by the embrace of unity. For the church, as an institution, will stand tall and unyielding, a rock in the storm. But the clock will have reversed, and with it, the proliferation of diversity will give way to uniformity. The differences that once divided will give way to an echo of belief, a chorus of faith. History is a river, and it too has its reversals. From the persecution of the Christians by the Romans, to the rise of a Christian empire, to the transformation of a nation from the bonds of slavery to the hand of leadership, so shall it be in the arena of faith. The great reversion will unveil the source, and in its wake, it will undo the divisions that have festered like wounds. But this reversal will not be wrought by the literal interpretation of the Nazarene's words. No, it will be the metaphor that will lead us back to the heart of His message, to the wellspring of faith.\n\nAnd so, we must look back, far back, to the time before the Romans, to the time when the Jews were but a people, divided among themselves. For it was then that the foundation was laid, the core belief that would spark the fire, the monotheism that would be the light in the darkness. The Hebrew scriptures, divinely revealed, held the authority that would shape the world. But the people did not share one spirit, they were divided: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk. Yet, amidst these divisions, a seed was sown, a seed that would grow into the tree of faith we know today.",
            "In the grim heart of The Jungle, Upton Sinclair lays bare the cold, unyielding truth of human nature. It is a truth so stark and starkly bleak that it seems to cry out from the very gutters of Packingtown itself. The men who hold the reins of power, the owners and managers, they are but vultures, their eyes fixed on the horizon, hungering for more, more, always more. They care not for the wretched souls who toil in their factories, nor for the foul effluvium that chokes the air and poisons the earth. The factories stand like monstrous, blackened titans against the sky, their chimneys belching forth rivers of smoke, a constant, acrid testament to their disregard for life and nature. Sinclair paints a picture so vivid, so stark, that one can almost smell the acrid stench of the animals' waste and urine, and feel the bitter taste of the poisoned rain on one's tongue.\n\nThe men who wield power in this realm care not for the men who serve them. They are but cogs in a great, grinding machine, their worth measured in the dollars they generate. They work long hours in the stench and filth of the factories, their backs bent, their spirits broken, all for the fleeting promise of a dollar's worth of sustenance. And when the owners and managers deem it fit, they cast them aside like so much refuse, their lives and livelihoods discarded with as little concern as they would a used and torn rag. There were no protections then, no safety nets to catch the fallen. The unions, they were little more than bandits, preying on the weak and the desperate for a fraction of the crumbs that fell from the table of the mighty. The workers were slaves, in all but name, chained to their toil, their lives dictated by the whim of their masters. And so, they suffered, and they died, their bodies and their spirits broken, their lives snuffed out like the candles in the gloom of Packingtown. And still, the factories stood, and the owners and managers watched, their eyes ever fixed on the horizon, hungering for more, more, always more.",
            "In the vast tapestry of literature, authors employ manifold techniques to weave a particular atmosphere or tone around their subjects. Among these, F. Scott Fitzgerald's mastery in The Great Gatsby is a testament to the power of symbolism and the pairing of incongruous elements. Fitzgerald's use of color to evoke sentiment is particularly noteworthy. He imbues certain hues with profound significance, transforming them into vehicles for emotion and meaning.\n\nWhite and gray, in particular, are loaded with connotation in Fitzgerald's novel. White, often associated with purity and sophistication, is employed to signify the upper echelons of society, while gray, with its association to age and decay, represents the faded remnants of that upper class. This duality is evident from the outset. Daisy and Jordan, for instance, are consistently portrayed in white attire, while Nick's attire at Gatsby's party, a \"white flannel suit\" (41), underscores this theme of uniformity and privilege. Even the background, the \"white chasms\" (56) of lower New York, reinforces this idea. Conversely, the \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable and the \"gray cars\" (23) in the valley of ashes represent the ordinariness and transience of the lower class. The dog seller, too, is a \"gray old man\" (27), suggesting the decay and monotony of his life.\n\nFitzgerald builds upon this color imagery, subtly reinforcing their meanings throughout the novel. When Daisy is described as wearing a \"white dress\" (74), the reader is reminded of her uniform status as an object of Gatsby's affection, rather than a multifaceted character. The \"gray haze\" (18) of Daisy's fur collar further emphasizes this uniformity, as does her subsequent appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's altercation. This consistent use of white and gray to denote Daisy as a mere symbol of Gatsby's longing underscores Fitzgerald's ability to manipulate color to convey complex sentiments.",
            "In the arid expanse of San Diego County, the sun-baked earth yields a bounty of crops, nurtured by an unyielding climate. Tomatoes and citrus, leafy greens and squash, peppers and peaches, all flourish under the relentless sun. The land, a tapestry of chaparral and nonnative grasses, is a symphony of growth, where honeybees hum and birdsong echoes. The market for organic produce is robust, with a hunger for the pure and the natural, a niche that many have sought to fill, their waiting lists stretching on like a serpent's path.\n\nThe cost of this purity is steep, for the landowner must toil with hands and mind, not with the lazy reach of chemicals. Pests and weeds must be vanquished by the sweat of the brow, and the soil nourished with the wisdom of time and care. Losses are frequent, for the organic path is a winding one, fraught with uncertainty. But the rewards are manifold, for the land becomes a sanctuary, a haven for the wild, where the air is clear and the water pure. The landowner walks a tightrope, seeking balance between profit and preservation, between the needs of the market and the needs of the land.\n\nThe parcel in question sits on the edge of Potrero, a relic of a time long past, a testament to the tenacity of the human spirit. It is 160 acres of chaparral and oak woodland, next to the Cleveland National Forest, a haven for creatures great and small. The air is thick with the scent of pine and the whisper of wind through leaves, a symphony of life, where the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog still roam.\n\nThis land was once the domain of the indigenous people, their footprints echoing through the ages. Then came the ranchers, their cattle and their dreams, their axes and their fires. Now, the land lies fallow, a silent witness to the ebb and flow of time.\n\nThe landowner, a seeker of balance and a lover of the wild, has chosen this piece of earth as his canvas, his challenge. He scours the government's offerings, seeking aid and wisdom, a path to profitability and preservation. And so, he finds himself in the company of others, who have walked this path before, their farms nestled in the foothills, their fields a testament to the possibility of a different kind of future.",
            "Culture bears a certain weight on any discourse, like the ghost in the machine. It is not a singular thing, nor is it a simple equation. One must understand that culture is not a monolith, but a complex landscape, ever-shifting and ever-mystifying. It is as much about what it is not as what it is, and what it signifies. The notion that \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is as foolish as the man who believes the sun circles the earth.\n\nWhen one steps into the realm of another, they do not see a culture as an objective truth, but through the prism of their own. Comparisons are inevitable, and it is in these comparisons that understanding can begin. To grasp a foreign culture, one must first study its history, its prejudices, its ghosts. Not to judge or to change, but to accept, to respect, to work within its boundaries. For the negotiator who comes to the table with a weaker hand, the respect for tradition and belief is not just an adornment, but a lifeline.\n\nCulture is not confined to borders, but resides in the hearts and minds of men. Corporations, for instance, bear their own peculiar cultures, like islands in a sea. Some glorify long hours, others a more relaxed pace. It is in employee dress, communication style, hiring practices, even the charities they support, that a culture is revealed. The American corporate culture? It is a labyrinth, a landscape of diversity. Some cultures appear uniform, like a vast plain, but they too hide valleys and mountains.\n\nValues, they are the heart of a culture, the why behind the what. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, then the negotiator must tread lightly, lest he cause offense. If a hard-driven bargain is the order of the day, then patience is a virtue. Understanding these things before the negotiation begins is not just beneficial, it is essential. But a negotiator would be wise to learn something of his adversary, to peer into their soul, to make the negotiation more than just a dance of words.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.' So spake the Psalmist, and the same sentiment echoed in the mind of Saint Anselm, who sought to prove the existence of the divine through the lens of faith and introspection. As we traverse the path of these two learned men, we must first acknowledge their shared belief in the existence of the God of the Bible, lest we stray from the very essence of their arguments. To do otherwise would be like trying to compare night and day, for both men are firmly rooted in the belief that a single divine entity stands at the center of existence.\n\nAnselm's path is one of the spirit, a journey inward to find the proof of God within the confines of our own souls. He posits that the very notion of God's nonexistence is not something we can comprehend, for it lies beyond the realm of our understanding. The proof for God, then, is not to be found in the outside world, but within our own minds, where we innately know the truth. This is faith, the acceptance of that which cannot be proven by empirical means, yet is steadfastly believed.\n\nContrast this with the path of Saint Thomas Aquinas, who sought to prove the existence of God through reason and empirical evidence. He believed that no faith was necessary, for logic alone could persuade even the most skeptical. Five arguments he laid forth: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, each a logical necessity pointing to the existence of God. To him, the proof of God was as straightforward as knowing the missing piece of a puzzle, for the whole exists only because the missing piece is present.\n\nYet, both men, in their pursuit of truth, leave us with a question. For neither provides a holistic basis for belief in God. Their arguments, while strong and valid, fail to account for the complexity of faith and its role in our understanding of the divine.",
            "In the quietude of the fifth or sixth century before the common era, a prince was born, whom the world would come to know as Buddha. His journey led him to renounce the trappings of his birth and embrace enlightenment, birthing a creed that would become Buddhism—a faith that, in its Theravada iteration, boasts a history of nearly twenty-five hundred years. This path, however, is not static; it has evolved, much like the ancient Lanka where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a ritual that bears little resemblance to Buddha's teachings. This transformation is not confined to mere traditions but permeates the very essence of the religion, as both monks and laymen must adapt to new doctrinal principles, shaped by forces that are as varied as they are relentless.\n\nTo navigate this discourse, let us define some key terms: Internal forces are those born of the followers of Buddha's teachings, regardless of their monastic status. External forces hail from those who are not Buddhist. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm the Buddhist community, driven by a warped perception of the faith. Benign forces, on the other hand, may inadvertently aid or hinder the community, their intentions often unclear.\n\nFirst, we must delve into the heart of Theravada Buddhism, its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the repository of Buddhist wisdom, contained within the Tripitaka—the Three Baskets. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical underpinnings of Buddhism, including concepts like Anatta—the absence of a soul, Dukkha—the inherent suffering of life, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Recognizing these truths is the path to ending Sansara, the endless cycle of death and rebirth, and with it, the extinguishing of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, with laymen embracing five precepts and monks adhering to a myriad of disciplinary rules. At the religion's core lies the Four Noble Truths: First, the truth of Dukkha—the suffering inherent in life. Second, the truth of attachment as the cause of that suffering. Third, the truth that this suffering can indeed be overcome.",

[REDACTED] between these two nations continued, finally [REDACTED] just before the First World War. The [REDACTED] between the United States and Mexico began over [REDACTED] issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, and a [REDACTED] of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). This [REDACTED] is not uncommon among nations sharing a [REDACTED], as David M.

            "Fifteen years hence, a malady struck me, an affliction I'd not known to be lurking in the shadows of my health. I stood as a nurse, a role I'd chosen in the hope of finding solace in the steadfastness of my profession, for I'd felt the absence of such security in my youth. \"You'll always find work; people will always fall ill,\" they'd told me, and so, I'd yielded to the path of healing, though my heart yearned for the wilds of science or the ink-stained life of a journalist, a union of both worlds I'd once dreamt.\n\nYet here I am, at forty-six, alone, impoverished, and unable to toil. The years have passed, and though I draw breath, no wealth remains that I can call my own. Each day is a battle, a relentless onslaught on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing now is certain, yet one truth remains steadfast - my survival through these years owes much to my kin and a few steadfast friends, no matter how great my fortitude.\n\nAnd so, I say this: calamity will always find its way into our lives, be it great or small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well we prepare, some storms are too vast to weather alone.\n\nI concur that we, as Americans, must cease our reliance on the faltering leviathan of our government. Yet I pine for a return to trust, a resurgence of mutual aid and the sharing of resources. The rugged individualism that our forefathers lauded was not their salvation; it was the compassion, respect, and shared burden that bore them through trials.\n\nSo, let us be ready. I have stocked a cache of supplies, first aid, purifying tablets, and duct tape for the windows in times of biotic strife. I have prepared flashlights and batteries aplenty, candles and matches, and rations for the lean times. Should you possess the land and means for a farm, do so; preserve your own food, and if you live in a dwelling, consider a wood stove. But while you gather your provisions, take the time to acquaint yourself with your neighbors.",
            "Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there boundaries or constraints that steer the course of their evolution? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson proclaimed, \"Even now, the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" This sentiment holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to the growth of mollusk skeletons, tracing their development through time and lineage (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our investigation seeks to understand how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can illuminate the mechanisms guiding evolutionary-developmental change. We utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which we then modeled using CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). Hypothetical shell morphologies were constructed to interpret potential morphological shifts within Prunum. These findings are integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell, in its essence, is a tubular structure traversing 360 degrees of space over time. These revolutions, or whorls, spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which these whorls enlarge varies, with a continuous line separating each. This line is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last, or body whorl. The spire is the remainder of the shell, with the apex at one end and the base at the other. The animal extends from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"usual\" orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nA method for counting whorls entails first viewing the shell from the apical perspective, then locating the first suture and dividing the shell accordingly. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be perceived as a series of apertures tracing a path through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The trajectory of this aperture can be both graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia, a sprawling land of stark contrasts, has remained steadfastly stagnant over the past decade. While the archipelago nation finds itself on a trajectory to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in regards to water and sanitation, the progress towards improving child and maternal health lags woefully behind the targets set for 2015. This disheartening state is a stark reminder of a system in need of fortification, rather than disparate programmatic interventions.",
            "Victorian novels, in their intricacies, are oft characterized by an unyielding focus on the minutiae of the aristocratic classes. However, two works, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, diverge from this mold, employing elements of mystery and the bizarre, atypical of the era's literary output. This divergence serves to illuminate the very souls of their characters, revealing their motivations and emotions in ways that transcend the somber elegance of their contemporaries.\n\n\"As the sun dipped low and the shadows lengthened, a host of confounding thoughts assailed him. He was once again in the grip of his pursuers, Sikes and Crackit, their voices echoing in his mind as if they still stood before him. He found himself speaking to them, as if the very words were his own. Then, a deafening report rent the air, and he was beset by a cacophony of shouts and cries. Lights danced before his eyes, a tumultuous symphony of chaos, and he was borne away, unseen hands thrusting him into the night. Through it all, a gnawing pain lingered, a constant torment that could not be ignored.\"\n\nThese novels employ this mystery through dreamlike states, each case varying in content and function. In Oliver Twist, these visions delve into the depths of Oliver's psyche, revealing his inner turmoil, his awareness of his plight, and the true nature of the world around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in Chapter 28, he relives the moment in vivid detail, as if trapped in a nightmare. The lack of control he experiences is underscored, as is his dire physical state, manifesting as hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he is borne away by unseen hands, the pain now a constant companion, linked with fear rather than surprise. This inability to control his fate raises questions about the unseen forces at work, for it was surely not his own will that led him here. A sense of defeat, of resignation, is palpable, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair, rendering him unable to react, even in his own defense.\n\n\"Days passed, yet they seemed but moments, as the sun dipped and rose once more, each time bringing with it a new dawn, yet also a new night, long in its silence, short in its passing.\"",
            "A few seasons past, I labored in a late-afternoon tutoring session, guiding young minds through the labyrinth of elementary subjects. My aptitude lay in the realm of English and the art of reading, a gift that I strove to share with those who sought it. A certain instructor, one who saw a need I could fill, directed me toward a young lad named Adrian, eking out his days in the third or fourth grade. His struggles with the written word were peculiar, such a peculiarity that it bore me to consider the strangeness of it all. This boy, a Latino by blood, spoke English as smoothly as a river.\n\nI was struck, as if by a stone from a slingshot, when I engaged his mother, a woman who knew only the tongue of her ancestors. With my meager grasp of Spanish, we communed, a dance of words and gestures. It was then that the truth revealed itself: Adrian could read, his mind a repository of stories and words, yet his grasp of the alphabet was as tenuous as a whisper in the wind.\n\nI share this tale to confront the specter of the language barrier that looms over our schools, especially in this forum of California. It is not always as plain as the nose on one's face. A child may speak English like the air around them, yet the act of reading it is a beast that can devour the unwary. We must address this issue, for it is clear that it exists. The solution for Adrian was simple: tutoring in the basics of English, aiding his grasp of letters and their sounds. But for those who barely know the tongue, the solution is a tapestry woven with the threads of complexity.\n\nThe dual language system is a boon, a beacon of hope for those whose first language is Spanish, but also for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically,\" I have read. Fears persist, that this is a squandering of resources, that the majority will reap no benefit. Let us not be swayed by these doubts. If we were to embrace this method as the norm, all children would gain from its wisdom. But how do we accomplish this? Do we demand bilingual teachers from each and every classroom? That would be a heavy burden to bear. Yet, why should we not employ special aides, tutors, whatever name one may give, who possess the gift of tongues?",
            "From the cradle of our youth, we are told there is a greater force, a power beyond our grasp, inscrutable and vast. Some are sent to the House of God to learn its ways, while others seek solace in the quietude of their own hearts. Many embrace the faith passed down by their lineage, but some reject it utterly, their souls tethered only to the self. Yet, we all traverse our own paths, our own peculiar journeys of spirit. We search for a beacon in the darkness, a light to guide us from the shadows into the sun's embrace.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I inquired about his favored bird. We sat on the porch, the rain hammering against the tin roof like a thousand whispered secrets. The gutters sang a mournful dirge as they carried the rain away, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes filled with a gaze that was half-quest, half-remembrance. His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging loosely upon him, and his hair thin and sparse. He stared out into the rain, avoiding my gaze. I felt alone, adrift, and unable to speak to my father of the void I felt, for words would only make it more tangible, more real. I embraced him, returned to my seat, and scooted my chair closer, joining him in his silent vigil as the rain whispered its sorrowful lullaby.\n\nMy father's journey to the end was swift, his passing in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The poison and radiation did not ease his suffering, but prolonged his agony a few more months beyond the doctors' predictions. Such a god, I thought, must be cruel. Why would a god prolong life merely to see a child suffer? Alone in the night, I did not offer prayers. If such a god existed, he had long since ceased to listen to me.\n\nI had not wished to witness my father's passage from this world into the next. So I did not. I could not bear to see the life that had created me fade away before my eyes. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. Besides, I knew my father better than his kin, better than his family, and knew he would not wish for his only child to be a witness to his end. I curled into a ball in my bed for three days, awaiting the news.\n\nNo call came.",
            "The Gothic Novel, a hybrid of ancient and modern, a \"Gothic oxymoron,\" as Ian Watt posits in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, has been both reviled and revered, accused of lacking depth yet celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, fused old theatrical elements with modern mimicry of nature to birth a new literary form, a 'Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). It clung to the medieval, even as the term 'Gothic' was used to describe anything archaic or unsophisticated. In this marriage of the theatrical Gothic and the personal novel, the genre endured, becoming both obsolete and newly discovered to later readers.\n\nOne persistent theme in Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry, the medieval knight's training, retained and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, with its ideals of bravery, honor, and competence, was held dear by Gothic writers, a stark contrast to their perceived societal decline. Walpole, amidst political turmoil and accusations, may have longed for the morality of yesteryears. This is evident in his characters, particularly Frederic, who embodies chivalric traits. Even before meeting him, the reader senses his gallantry, his tragedy, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of infidels. He is, in essence, an exaggerated 'gallant and courteous Knight,' a trope of Gothic excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the ceaseless flow of goods from the end of the customer's order, through the labyrinth of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, to the final destination. The concept was first coined in '82 by a consultant named Keith Oliver, a man who understood the necessity of planning, implementing, and controlling the myriad of processes that constitute the supply chain in order to sate the fickle palate of the customer.\n\nSix are the pillars of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the pieces of a vast machine that, when synchronized, can create a symphony of efficiency.\n\nProduction, the first step in this dance of commerce, is the cornerstone upon which the entire edifice is built. It is the task of the manager to divine the desires of the customer, a task made easier by the expansive market, a mirror reflecting the shifting whims of demand. Once the customer's needs are understood, the manager must choose what to produce and in what quantities. The location of production is next, a decision guided by the volume and quality of goods required, and the ebb and flow of customer satisfaction.\n\nAfter the lion's share of production has been allocated, the manager's gaze falls upon the scheduling and maintenance of the machinery, a task that demands precision and forethought. Each detail, from the smallest cog to the grandest wheel, must be accounted for, lest the machine grind to a halt and the company's coffers grow thin.\n\nSupply, the second key element, is the strategic decisions made to define the core capabilities of a facility and the partnerships forged, like rivers carving their path through the landscape. A company may possess many divisions, each with its own tools, workers, and specialties. The manager must select the division best suited for each task, or outsource the work to others, a decision born of necessity, a bid to create velocity, the swift and sure delivery of quality at a cost that is both low and low enough.",
            "In the sullen streets of a land veiled by the mist of tyranny, a lone figure stands, a card in hand, a message scrawled in haste. Burma, a land not so distant, yet bound by shackles of iron and blood. A place where the sun hides behind the smoke of injustice, and the shadow of the military's boot presses down upon the necks of its people.\n\nThe monks, clad in saffron robes, once the beacon of hope, now lie upon the altars of despair, their screams echoing through the empty halls of the temples. The streets, once the canvas of their peaceful march, are now stained with the crimson of their blood. The air, thick with the stench of death and the smell of burned parchment, bears witness to the silence of the defiant.\n\nThe signs of their oppression are as old as the mountains that surround them. From the Roman tyrants to the gods of Japan's throne, the thirst for power has always run deep in the veins of the ruling class. The echoes of their atrocities resonate through history like a funeral dirge, a symphony of oppression played out in the crucible of time.\n\nThe ghosts of the past, the specters of the fallen, gather around the present, their whispers a lament for the innocents lost. The streets of Burma, once the stage for their defiance, now stand as a testament to their struggle, a silent cry for justice that reverberates through the halls of power.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in the realm of jazz is entrenched in his perpetual presence and his unyielding ability to shape his orchestra into a living, breathing entity. Though Ellington's touch upon the ivories is often subtle, his compositions are characterized by a depth and complexity that showcase the singular talents of his band members. As a composer, he forged a framework wherein soloists could roam freely, while also penning tightly woven pieces that drew out the unique styles of each musician, highlighting their musical voices like a master weaver might thread gold into his tapestry. His keen ear for the ensemble as a whole allowed him to fashion coherent, original sounds that danced to the rhythm of each composition.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its discussion on Ellington's sound and innovation, points to \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece, a deliberate twelve-bar blues, features call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smoothly and melodic, then transitioning to a rougher, more guttural sound. The muted trumpet solo in the second chorus elaborates on the melody and emphasizes those haunting blue notes that Ellington was so fond of. The clarinet solo in the third chorus sweeps through the high registers, backed by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase. The full band echoes the first chorus in the fourth, with a call and response between brass and reeds, while the fifth chorus introduces a high-register call and response from the reeds, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with the voice adopting the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument. A brief tag features a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending from the trombone.\n\nThe use of voice to add depth and tone to \"Creole Love Call\" is but one example of a stylistic trait that permeates Ellington's entire career. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, with Ellington employing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She'd always felt an insatiable hunger, a gnawing void that refused to be filled. It began when she was but a young buck, barely thirteen, and the hunger still hounded her at seventeen. 'Twas not for things she craved, but a presence, a being to fill the emptiness within. Yet, no youth seemed to stir her heart. They'd tried, God bless 'em, with their awkward wooing, but none had captivated her. She'd pondered this strange affliction, conjuring theories, yet none satisfied her curiosity. So, she lived, a wanderer in search of a haven.\n\nIn her home, she was a whirlwind, her parents' calm demeanor a stark contrast to her. They'd never argued, not even with their spirited daughter. She was a force to be reckoned with, their lively, likable girl, a beacon of their otherwise placid home.\n\nBut today, peace was shattered. As she prowled her abode, seeking inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. She rushed in, heart pounding, \"Mother?! Mother, what's amiss?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, moaning, \"Ow... sweet... take me... to the hospital.\" She lifted her, her strength tested, and bore her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's stench of death and illness permeated, but she barely noted it, her thoughts consumed by her mother's plight.

            "In the desolation of the epidemiological expanse, a study was undertaken to illuminate the shadowed path between the Mediterranean Diet (Med diet) and the scourge of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The alternate Mediterranean diet (aMed), a variant of the Med diet characterized by an abundance of plant foods and fish, and a scarcity of animal products and saturated fats, was our compass. Moderation in alcohol, a mere fleeting indulgence amidst the austerity of plant life, was allowed.\n\nPrevious wanderings through the realms of epidemiological data had revealed an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and heart disease. Yet, the specter of stroke and stroke mortality remained in the shadows, unexamined.\n\nA cohort of 74,886 women, ranging from 38 to 63 years of age, unscathed by the ravages of chronic disease, were our subjects. Over the course of two decades, from 1984 to 2004, we traversed the landscape of their dietary habits,  guided by self-reported food frequency questionnaires. Six times we navigated this terrain, and each time, we calculated the aMed score, a measure of their dietary adherence. More than 95% of our subjects remained steadfast in their participation, a testament to their commitment.\n\nTo mitigate the vagaries of randomness, we calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score, ensconced within the cycles of the preceding years. We navigated the treacherous waters of confounding factors, adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nWith the aid of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, we charted the path between the aMed diet and the risks of CHD and stroke, both fatal and nonfatal. Over the two decades, we recorded 2391 incidents of CHD, 1763 incidents of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women who inhabited the upper echelons of the aMed quintile traversed a safer path, with a lower risk of both CHD and stroke, their relative risk reduced to 0.71.\n\nThus, in the pursuit of health, the Mediterranean Diet, a path less traveled, proved to be a beacon, guiding us towards a safer, healthier shore.",
            "In the year of the Lord two thousand and seven, the United States of America found itself in the throes of a calamity that would shake its very foundations. The once mighty economy, like a brittle tree in a storm, was felled by the harsh winds of financial ruin. Unemployment spread like a plague, the housing market crumbled, and many of America’s most august corporations were reduced to naught but bones. Alas, this recession continues to this day, and we must inquire: how did such a crisis come to pass, and how may we prevent a recurrence?\n\nBehold, the roots of this economic blight were sown in the late nineties, during the tenure of President Bill Clinton, who, like a hungry wolf, sought to extend his reign. His administration, in its zeal to maintain popularity and secure a second term, relaxed lending restrictions, thus paving the way for the sub-prime crisis that would engulf the nation seven years hence. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times spoke of the perils that lay ahead, warning that Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, might meet a similar fate as the savings and loan industry of the eighties.\n\nIndeed, the groundwork was laid for a disaster of epic proportions. Banks and corporations, driven by greed and ignorance, issued sub-prime loans to those ill-equipped to repay. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under pressure from the government and shareholders alike, repackaged these mortgages into complex financial instruments, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs). When the inevitable defaults occurred, the banks were left with insufficient capital reserves, and the chaos spread like wildfire to the economy at large.\n\nThe financial structure that underpinned this crisis was as intricate as a spider's web, with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations all intertwining the economy with the housing market. This overexposure left households and financial institutions alike extremely vulnerable to even the slightest changes in price. The housing bubble burst, and the institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were consumed by the flames of their own excess.\n\nThe top five investment banks in the United States, together, reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for approximately thirty percent of the nation's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of intense regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September of the year two thousand and eight.",

Dr. Merlin herself has been known to vent her spleen upon her keyboard, cursing the endless parades of words that serve no purpose but to drown out the true narrative.\n\nShow, don't tell, the wise adage echoes through the halls of literature, yet even the most seasoned writer stumbles, entangled in the snares of exposition. It's the whispering tempter that urges you to get the backstory out of the way, to hurry to the good parts, to tell the audience every detail that you think they need to know.\n\nExposition, in its simplest form, is the author's confession. It's the tales told by the old man in the corner, the whispers of the past, the core-dump of information meant to bore the unwary reader. It's the brother speaking to the sister, the husband to the wife, the world to the unknowing.\n\nConsider, if you will, the meeting of two souls, their love story etched in the fabric of time. The telling of their union, their love, their tragedy, should not be a mere recounting of facts. It should be a dance, a symphony, a testament to the bond that transcends the mundane. The husband's love should be evident in his words, his deeds, his very being. The heroine, too, should wear her affection like a badge, her thoughts and dreams reflected in the prism of his eyes.\n\nYet, too often, the writer rushes, eager to get to the point. The night manager of the gas station, once a man of the skies, now a provider of fuel and dreams. His past, his present, his future, all laid bare in a few, hastily scrawled lines.

The reader should feel the echo of the heroine's sorrow, the weight of the husband's memory. And so, the writer must provide that weight, that echo, that sorrow. They must provide the meat on the bare bone of the story, the substance that makes the bones dance. They must make the reader feel, must make the reader care. For without that, the words are but hollow shells, the story a mere echo of a tale.\n\nBut enough of these musings. Dr. Merlin must put down her quill, must turn her thoughts to other matters.

They gave him but two minutes, a fleeting moment in the annals of evil.\n\nThe second tidings were of an early morning shooting, a young man named Travis Buyers, shot in Sharon Woods, critically wounded. No arrests, no suspects, save the SWAT team, prowling like predators in the dawn. This tale, too, was brief, and I could not help but notice the silence that enshrouds the black man's cry. The media's gaze, it seems, is a fickle mistress, turning away from the minority's plight when it should be thunderous with outrage.\n\nThen came the tale of a bullet's path, a .22 caliber from some unseen rifle, that had marred a Med-Flight helicopter.

Within its coils, emotions writhe and twist: love's fiery embrace, pride's cold, hard grip, jealousy's acid bite, cruelty's brutal edge. Brothers know each other's faces as if they were their own reflection. In storm's eye, they are laid bare, good or ill. The cost, it is steep, these feelings born of kin. To see oneself in another's eyes, one sees not how others see them, but as they truly are. It is in actions and their fruits that a man's soul is laid bare.

Disappointment bitter as gall collides with pride fierce as a wildfire in the end, and but one brother finds life's breath. The bond's theme is stitched into fabric of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions, as well as the voice of the teller, which bears the tangled feelings the boy feels, and his view of the world, which shapes his steps.\n\nThe boy's heart, it is a furnace, burning with pride. From the first time he and his brother, Doodle, took to the wilds, to the last, fatal hunt, resentment smolders within him. He desired a brother to share his world, teach his skills: breath-holding, running, climbing the Old Woman Swamp's vines. He yearned for a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, perch with in the pine's highest fork. But fate dealt him a harsh hand, Doodle born with a heart weak as paper. The boy's dreams, they crumbled like sandcastles. Anger gnaws at him, as he ponders smothering his brother with a pillow. Such thoughts, they are chilling, yet hope comes when Doodle smiles. His heart, it softens, and love, it stirs. Perhaps his hate was not eternal, for in his soul, a love for his brother lay dormant.",
            "The human brain, a labyrinthine crucible of creative thought, has been likened to sundry implements of language and artifice as time has unspun its thread. Once a humble wax tablet, then a scroll of papyrus, it has been compared to a book, a volume of words and tales, and now, in these modern times, to a contraption of metal and glass, a machine that hums and whirs with the promise of order and control. But let us not forget, the metaphor, like a map, is but a guide, not the territory itself. For the brain is a wilderness of unknowable vastness, teeming with processes that defy our understanding.\n\nInformation, like a river, flows into the brain through the gates of our senses. The eyes see, the ears hear, the skin feels, the nose smells, the tongue tastes. Physical sensations, transformed into electrochemical impulses, dance in the brain's hallowed halls. Upward and downward, the information is processed, woven into patterns of meaning. In the grand ballet of perception, the simple data of color and shape, of sound and touch, coalesce, as if by some unseen hand, into a coherent whole. The brain, in its wisdom, speeds the process, drawing upon past experiences, upon the knowledge it has already amassed, to make sense of the world anew.\n\nAttention, that fickle mistress, decides the fate of the information that passes through the brain. Like a shepherd guiding his flock, it chooses which bits of knowledge to highlight, which to ignore. The blades of grass beneath our feet pass unnoticed, a blur of green and brown, while a name, spoken in a crowded room, stands out, clear as day.\n\nMemory, the brain's vast repository of knowledge, is a many-towered citadel, each tower serving a different function. Sensory memory, fleeting as a dream, holds the information of our immediate experiences. Working memory, that tenuous bridge between the past and the present, maintains the information for a brief span of time. And long-term memory, the grand library of our lives, stores the knowledge that shapes us, that makes us who we are.\n\nModels of the brain's knowledge, like ancient maps, have attempted to chart its many rivers and valleys. Some are drawn from the tales of human experience, others from the language of computers, still others from the whispers of the brain's own neurology. The semantic network, for instance, posits that knowledge is organized in a lattice of interlinked nodes, each node representing a concept, each link a trace of relatedness. Thus, \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which in turn is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth, a web of meaning that stretches out in all directions.\n\nBut beware, dear seeker of knowledge, for the brain, like a wild beast, resists easy understanding. It is a country of night and mystery, of fire and ice, where the road ahead is always shrouded in fog. Yet, it is a land of wonder and beauty, a place where the most profound truths lie hidden, waiting to be discovered.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" the specter of technology and its capitalist underpinnings is laid bare through the lens of a dystopian society where community and immediate gratification are elevated above individuality. The populace is conditioned from birth, their lives dictated by a World Controller who manipulates their desires and their beliefs. This is no mere exercise in social critique, but a Marxist meditation on the very nature of power and its perversions. The novel's terminology - homogeny, reification - echo the author's unease with the encroaching economic systems of his time.\n\nCapitalism, Huxley suggests, is a false consciousness, a veil that blinds the masses to their true economic relationships. The common folk, the Deltas, the Gammas, are mere cogs in the machine, their wills subsumed by hypnopædia, their desires channeled into consumption. The World Controller wields hegemony, an invisible hand that guides the lower classes into accepting their place. The Alphas and Betas, born with the capacity for awareness, remain complacent, content to accept their lot, few exceptions like Bernard questioning the status quo.\n\nIn this world, relationships are shallow, emotions stifled. Love does not exist, only the superficial. The males' comments are reduced to the physical, the females' encounters matter-of-fact. Social hierarchy is accepted with absolute obedience, each class content in their place, a testament to Marxist thought on the proletariat's false sense of superiority. The rise of technology and capitalism, Huxley seems to say, is a death of free will and expression, a world where the individual is lost in the collective.",
            "I've toiled at University Park for nigh on two and a half years, or four semesters. The sprawl of campus, it seems, is a vast and unyielding beast, and traversing it can be a trial. Freshman year, I was quartered in East Halls, the eastern extremes of the university, save for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The Willard Building, nestled near the heart of campus, was a distant quest, a journey that could take up to a quarter-hour by foot, if the weather was unkind, as it oft was in State College. An alum, barely grown from boyhood, told me that once, the East Halls were a lonely outpost, surrounded by vast tracts of empty land. Now, that barren space is claimed by sports fields, new edifices like the Creamery and health services building, and apartments. As the campus grows, so does the burden of travel. What is the remedy? The bicycle, a silent, swift companion. Yet, bikes will not suffice if the campus does not bend to their need.\n\nI spoke with a friend who, after a long sojourn, took to the roads once more. \"Bikes are the only way,\" he said, \"the wind in your hair, the world at your feet.\" It is a truth as plain as the sun, that bicycling is the most efficient way to traverse the world. A humble bowl of oatmeal and a few turns of the pedals can take you far. Like many of my fellow students, I dwell off campus, as far from the heart as some dorms. This year, my wisest decision was to claim a bike. The Thomas Building, my daily destination, would take me a quarter-hour's walk, but a swift ride on two wheels can reduce that time to a mere five minutes. The road is not always kind, Pollock Road, a straight, unyielding path, yet it remains the shortest route. Walking, yes, but I have not the time. Without my bike, walking would be my only recourse, a journey that would claim an extra half-hour each day, a weekly toll of more than two hours. Add to that the time spent walking to and from classes, appointments, the like, and the weight of time is more than I can bear."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies.

            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

The values I bring to this noble endeavor are service, respect, an unyielding adherence to ethics, and a commitment to foster healthier relationships between individuals.

Post-graduation, I took a breather, a period of introspection and contemplation.\n\nOne fateful summer, I found myself at a friend's residence, where I encountered a young lad, barely sixteen, shrinking timidly on her couch. His plight was stark and raw, a stark reminder of the darkness that can lurk within the shadows of a family. The next day, upon learning of his desperate call to the police, I ventured to his parents' abode, hoping to lend what aid I could. The police, recognizing my credentials, asked that I intervene, for the law's reach is limited in matters of the heart.\n\nThe parents, nervous and defensive, spun tales of their son's \"manipulative\" nature, dismissing his distress as mere \"simple\" family squabbles.

            "The following discourse examines the Biological and Sociocultural paradigms in the context of the affliction known as insomnia. The Biological model concentrates on inheritable genetic information and the physiological facets of health. The Sociocultural model, conversely, surveys environmental relationships and their implications for race, ethnicity, demographics, and socio-economic status. This analysis of insomnia delves into these models, selecting specific research to elucidate and elaborate upon them. Critiques of the research and its findings follow, highlighting their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias and Parasomnias; secondary disorders are those linked with Axis I or Axis II mental disorders; tertiary disorders are those arising from medical conditions or substance intake. Primary Dyssomnias include: Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-related Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Insomnia, a primary Dyssomnia, is marked by difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep. Hypersomnia, another primary Dyssomnia, is characterized by an inability to remain awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves symptoms such as cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Primary Parasomnias, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, are marked by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep. The focus of this review is primarily on insomnia, with some consideration given to primary sleep disorders generally, in the context of the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers on genes, inherited traits, and the physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, are pivotal in regulating sleep and wakefulness. This study utilized mice to demonstrate that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are integral to sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor induces sleep-promoting responses, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Administration of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that animal models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. Impairment or absence of this receptor could impact one’s ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration would naturally disrupt it. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as academic pursuits, career prospects, and daily tasks requiring monotonous focus.",
            "This treatise unfolds into three distinct arenas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) as it is sometimes denominated. Firstly, we offer a concise elucidation of the affliction itself. Then, we delve into the process of its diagnosis, identifying the common markers, or \"red flags,\" that signify its presence. Lastly, we conclude with strategies for a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment to aid a student grappling with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, a malady of the central nervous system, denotes the efficaciousness and efficacy with which the brain processes auditory information. More narrowly construed, it refers to the CNS's perceptual processing of sound and the neurobiologic underpinnings of that processing, resulting in electrophysiological auditory potentials. In simpler terms, it is a disorder wherein the brain fails to properly interpret what we hear, despite normal hearing. Those stricken with CAPD do not suffer from \"hearing impairment,\" but rather, the region of the brain tasked with translating sounds, particularly distinguishing words amidst background noise, malfunctions.\n\nThe first whispers of this disorder emerged in the mid-1950s, when researchers encountered children with communicative disorders. The Italian trio of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing diagnostic tests for these young ones in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to elucidate the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) underlying such perception. A seminal conference held in 1977 catalyzed further research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD vary widely: the afflicted may struggle to localize sounds in space, differentiate between multiple sound events, recognize sound patterns, discern changes in speech, or integrate sound clues. They may also be confounded by a subsequent sound blocking out the previous one, or be unable to determine the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosing CAPD involves \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" executed by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or other specialists employing an array of measures. No single tool or test guarantees a high rate of diagnostic success, and the cause of CAPD remains elusive. Tests often present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and request the identification of specific items. More advanced methods involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "In the realm of Twelfth Night, the specter of deception looms large, a specter that, while offering respite and protection, ultimately jeopardizes the very soul of the deceiver. For though disguise may serve as a shield, it is a double-edged blade, sharpened by the necessity of truth, and the risk of alienation. A disguise, once donned, becomes a prison, and the deceiver, a captive, forever haunted by the specter of their own making.\n\nThe question then arises: Why does Viola, in her plight, choose the guise of a man? Is it not a form of self-preservation, a shield against the harsh world she finds herself in? \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Yet, in assuming this new identity, she cuts herself off from the women she would normally turn to, depriving herself of a vital support system.\n\nMoreover, her disguise does not go unnoticed. Olivia, mistaking her for her brother, is smitten. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) And then there is Orsino, who, in his words, is drawn to her as a man would be to a woman. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nIn this tale, deception serves as a catalyst, forcing suppressed emotions to the surface. Olivia's affections for Cesario are they of a man, or a woman in disguise? Or does she harbor a secret longing for the same sex, a longing that Cesario's appearance forces her to confront? It is a question that lingers, a question that Shakespeare seems to leave unanswered, save for the ease with which Olivia shifts her affections, from Cesario to Sebastian, regarding Cesario/Viola as family rather than love interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "In the annals of colonial brutality, the German empire's reign over South West Africa stands as a grim testament, notably for the wholesale annihilation of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. Yet, such a monolithic description does scant justice to the empire's varied apparatus and methods. Educational endeavors, like the empire itself, varied widely across its colonial outposts. When the British took possession of German East Africa in 1919, they found a populace well-versed in the art of literacy and learning. Likewise, the educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were met with approbation from contemporaries. However, the terrain of South West Africa (now Namibia) bore a starkly different hue.\n\nUnlike in East Africa, where the state took a direct hand in the education of the natives, South West Africa's educational burden was largely shouldered by missionaries, receiving meager government aid. The colonial government, however, lavished resources on the education of Europeans, establishing a robust system of state schools and bolstering missionary efforts. These policies cast a long shadow, shaping the educational landscape long after the Germans' departure. While other colonies boasted significant numbers of literate natives, South West Africa's populace remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. A confluence of social, political, and economic factors birthed this divergent experience. This paper embarks on an investigation to elucidate these factors, with a keen eye on new research into the settlers' and authorities' attitudes towards the indigenous populace.\n\nA plethora of literature chronicles the educational landscape of the German colonial empire, most notably during its waning years. The majority of these sources are in the German tongue, penned during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works sought to describe the educational systems with a matter-of-factness, while later English-language studies broadened the discourse with comparative analyses and detailed examinations. Cohen's work, in particular, stands out, comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and positing the large settler population as a key factor in shaping South West Africa's educational landscape.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate, while moderately temperate, bore a stark contrast to the arid deserts that covered much of the territory. This relative hospitability was reflected in its European population, which, by 1913, numbered nearly 15,000, dwarfing the next largest settler population in East Africa, which stood at a mere 5,336.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded over the past century to encompass a multitude of genres, many of which have given birth to numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Arguably, the sub-genre of heavy metal, born from the crucible of rock and roll, has become one of the most diverse and expressive of them all. Its diversity stems from the realization that it held a flexibility unparalleled within the realm of popular music, allowing artists to forge their own path and spawn an innumerable array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has reached a point of such niche specialization that it is difficult to pin down what exactly constitutes heavy metal. It incorporates themes from various other genres, yet it is rooted in the darkness that has long been its hallmark. Metal is, in many ways, a \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It is less primitive, more skilled, the musicians displaying a mastery of their instruments that is unmistakable.\n\nMetal is also a movement steeped in the darker, more visceral qualities that have long been shunned by popular music. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to a wild, otherworldly sound that served as a release for the darker aspects of the human experience. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era, which embraced the darker, more melancholic emotions. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" display the darker side of music, a theme that resonates through the history of heavy metal. This song, considered one of the first heavy metal tracks, was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, darker sound. The Beatles sought to prove that they could match the Stones' intensity, leading to the creation of a track that would forever change the landscape of popular music.",
            "In the annals of time, ere the Surrealists took to canvas their fantastical visions, there walked among us an artist named Henri Rousseau. Born in the hamlet of Laval, northwest France, he was not of the educated sort, his father a humble tinsmith and hardware dealer, their prosperity but a shadow of the bourgeois life. From boy to man, he bore no brush nor palette, save for the requisite tools of his trade as a gabelou, a municipal toll collector. His life, a tapestry woven with threads of toil and strife, saw him widowed thrice, his heart a desolate plain save for his daughter Julia. To this world of sorrow, he turned to painting, a sanctuary from the storm of his grief.\n\nHis oils, they are not the product of a learned hand, but the unvarnished dreams of a man who yearned for acceptance, for praise. The Dream, his masterpiece of 1910, is not merely a woman lost in reverie, but Rousseau’s own heart laid bare, his dreams and fears entwined. To conform or to forge his own path, that was the dilemma that gnawed at him, a choice between mimicry and authenticity.\n\nTo fully comprehend The Dream, one must first know the man. Rousseau was a painter of the common folk, his hopes and dreams as ordinary as the men and women he painted. His struggle, it was not born of pride, but desperation, for he was an old man, uneducated, painting in an era where geniuses thronged the salons. Recognition came late, like a reluctant stranger, when Matisse had already begun to make his name. But while Matisse feared the trite, Rousseau craved the ordinary, for it was in the mundane that he found his voice.",
            "The great minds have long posited an intimate kinship between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty, a connection as profound as the roots entwined in the dark earth. It is a bond of the spirit, not the intellect, a dance of souls rather than a debate of minds. As Keats so pithily put it, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding of life is gleaned through education or experience, yet we seem to apprehend ethics and aesthetics without these overt guides. They are not prescribed, but described, not rules but explanations. We seek to comprehend why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than dictate how to create good art or moral behavior.\n\nMoreover, any critique of art or morality can never fully encapsulate the essence of that which it seeks to elucidate. A discourse on da Vinci's Mona Lisa might dwell on technical aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these do not illuminate why it is art. When queried about a beloved work of art or literature, one commonly hears, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more complex explication. This \"something\" defies description, a transcendent quality that imbues both art and morality with a power that cannot be quantified. As O'Connor aptly noted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"\n\nEthics, too, possesses this same evasive nature. Wittgenstein proclaimed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this \"something,\" this ineffable essence, that is art and morality's most potent attribute, and it is this transcendental nature that links them. We experience both morality and art at a level that is felt, yet elusive, a noumenal realm as Kant might describe. The art of literature, particularly, is steeped in this moral quality. As McKean observed, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "In the shadows of the Alps, from the frost-kissed peaks of München to the Baltic's icy embrace in Kiel, Germany stands united. A land of stark contrasts and ancient echoes, its culture a tapestry woven from the threads of the past. From Köln, with the Rhine's steady whisper, to the heart of the land and the Elbe's steady flow, the spirit of Germania pulses through the veins of this nation.\n\nThe origins of the name, Germania, are shrouded in the mists of history, a wrestling match between scholars and historians. Tacitus, in his 98 AD work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" spoke of the Germans as an aboriginal people, untouched by the hands of time. Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, a tale of conquest and blood, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish those he had not yet conquered from those he had. The origin, perhaps, a Gaulish word for neighbor, or a shout from the battlefield, a Ger, the ancient spear's cry.\n\nTacitus, in his account, noted the reluctance of the Romans to venture into the wilds of Germania, the icy lands with their sullen manners and harsh skies. The Germanic tribes, appearing on the borders of the empire in the first century, were a people of the land, their goods and skills traded for Roman gold and their warriors for the legions' ranks. They were a people of the borderlands, a people of the frontier, their existence a testament to the enduring spirit of a nation.",
            "I stared down, mind empty, eyes tracing the scene before me. Unmoved, silent, my senses acute yet unyielding, I observed the tableau with the cold, precise gaze of a man trained to see, not feel. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness, ephemeral as dust motes in sunlight, leaving no trace behind. It was as if my mind was a still lake, reflecting the world around me without judgment or distraction.\n\nOnce, a mentor gifted me a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" Since childhood, I'd yearned to capture what I saw, yet this task seemed as daunting as scaling a snowy peak. The book held the key, offering techniques to tame the wild chaos of perception. It taught me to frame my view, to simplify the complex into the manageable.\n\nYet, this day, I stood before a conundrum, a testament to human folly - a clogged toilet, a reminder of the mess we leave behind. I was no artist of the caliber of Picasso or Monet, but here, in this humble act, was my canvas, my story. My fingers tightened around the handle, my muscles tensing and releasing with practiced ease. I felt the power of creation, the thrill of imposing order on chaos.\n\nWater swirled, a serene dance of liquid, clear and clean. I struck the handle again, my frustration mounting with each futile attempt. The offending object remained, a stubborn rebuke to my efforts. I gripped the mop, my feet planted firmly, the green tie a noose around my neck. I was a man before a task, not a warrior, but a soldier nonetheless.\n\nThe wall's paper roll unraveled, wrapping my hand like an oven mitt. My mind wandered, the images of my would-be masterpieces dancing in the periphery of my vision. I dipped my hand into the cold water, the stark contrast jarring yet familiar. It was a ritual, a dance with the grotesque, a ballet of the banal. I was the artist, the janitor, the observer, the participant. I was, in that moment, everything.",
            "In the womb of concrete and steel, beneath the pallid glow of street lamps, the young die. A symphony of sterile statistics sings the same grim melody, echoing the deadly dance of the youngest drivers. The National Institutes of Health whisper in the language of science, their voices like the cold wind through the desert, that the teen brain is an untamed thing, unready for the perils of the open road. It is an inexperience that bites like a rattler, gnawing at the heart of the problem, spawning fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and roadsides where vehicles lie like fallen angels.\n\nThe company of peers, a vice that knows no age, clings to the young like a plague. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center reports that as the number of passengers increases, so too does the toll on the road. The shadows of the night grow long and dangerous, mirroring the shadows cast by the faces of youth.\n\nProvisional licenses, a mere bandage on a festering wound, are but a stopgap measure, a futile attempt to stem the tide. The truth is stark and unyielding: the youngest drivers, as a collective, are not yet fit to bear the risks and responsibilities. Marvin Zuckerman, a man who has delved into the depths of the human psyche, believes even 18 is too young. USA Today carries his words like a funeral procession, reporting that those under the age of 19-20 are drawn to the thrill of sensation, like moths to a flame.\n\nThe road awaits, yet the driver is not ready. The Baby Boomers' children, millions strong, stand at the precipice, ready to embrace the wheel. The tide of death will not be stemmed until the youngest drivers are given time to grow, to learn, to understand that the road is not a toy but a weapon, and that the thrill of speed is a dance with the devil.\n\nLegislation, a heavy hand upon the shoulder, must guide the young. Schools should keep their classrooms as sanctuaries, not graveyards. No motor vehicle shall be operated by one under the age of 18, save under the watchful eye of the law. A provisional permit, a stepping stone to the great highway, should be granted, but only after a certain number of hours, mirroring the practice of those states who have walked this path before. The law, uniform and unyielding, should protect the young across the nation, a shield against the deadly statistics.\n\nThis idea, this call for change, is not without precedence, a cry in the wilderness that has echoed before. Yet, it is a cry that must be heeded, a siren song in the face of the encroaching storm.",
            "In the dusty, labyrinthine halls of the Library of Congress's archives, I chanced upon a collection of Edison's early films, a collection that bore within it the seeds of illusion. Fifteen films, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901, these were trick films, each a testament to the ingenuity of their creators. My study delved into the poetics of these films, and the peculiarities that distinguished a few, later works.\n\nThe trick film of the turn of the century was a creature of its time, bound by the confines of the stage, framed by the proscenium, and bereft of the camera's movement. It was a world of long and medium shots, where the one shot equaled one film. Yet, a few dared to defy these boundaries, introducing the concept of multiple shots. The most striking feature these films shared was their setting: an interior stage, a proscenium, a frontality that echoed the theatre and vaudeville traditions.\n\nIn these films, actors moved side-to-side, like marionettes on a string, never venturing forth or retreating from the camera. The film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900) exemplifies this, with actors entering from the right, moving back and forth along the horizontal axis, always within the frame, the camera unmoving. Long and medium shots were the norm, close-ups absent, a nod to the theatre's practice of showing the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's borders.\n\nThe one shot equaling one film was the rule, limiting the films' length to a minute or less. This also limited their dramatic potential, reducing them to brief vaudeville-style tricks. Yet, a closer look at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) reveals the ruse: what appears to be one shot is actually many, joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance.",
            "In the verdant expanse of Caroline, John Taylor, a man of the soil and the soul, stood as an early and fervent champion of the Republican cause. Though his hands were stained with the earth and the ink of political discourse, it was his indomitable spirit that earned him renown, a spirit that burned bright with the flame of personal liberty and government accountability. His agrarian roots ran deep, and it was from this fertile ground that he drew the seeds of his convictions, nourished them with the waters of his political experience, and let them grow into a compendium of beliefs that embraced the sanctity of sovereignty, the sanctity of the Constitution, and the sanctity of the judicial system.\n\nTaylor, like a good farmer, saw in the new nation a field untill now, free from the weeds of native tradition that had choked the roots of old civilizations. Here, he believed, lay the opportunity to cultivate an ideal political system, a system born of natural rights, interdependent and indivisible. He saw these rights as the very essence of man, not to be trampled by the boot of government. In a world where strength and malice could easily flourish, he advocated for a civilization that shackled these dark tendencies, that tempered them with the light of justice and equity.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the inherent good and evil within man, a duality as old as time itself. He believed that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Taylor, pg. 167). His notion of good principles were those that safeguarded private property, fostered agriculture, and discouraged the rise of capitalism, for he saw in it the seeds of inequality and exploitation. A government founded on such principles, he argued, would function justly, regardless of the corrupting influence of avarice and self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many of his Republican brethren, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He saw in it a document that, if interpreted literally, could become a sword in the hands of the corrupt, a means for the federal government to grow fat and tyrannical. Yet, he also warned against a strictly literal interpretation, for it could easily become a rope, used to hang the intent of the founders. He held the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, for it more clearly described the nation as a union of sovereign states, not a single nation bound by the chains of federal power.",
            "Revisiting Figure 17, a stark decline in commuter log submissions occurred in the third month. This was a sobering sight, and the cause remains elusive. The New England winter, with its chilling grip, would account for some of the drop, as folks either pedal or stride less. The end of the fall semester, with its flurry of assignments and grading, may have led many to overlook the log. Additionally, December's festive flurry and ensuing month-long respite from campus duties diminished engagement. Classes resumed in late January, yet February's low log count remained unexplained. One might ponder the inevitable ebb in enthusiasm at the project's inception, countered by our Carpool Challenge Week in March, which spurred a renewed surge in submissions.\n\nBut a deeper challenge persists: the primacy of driving, a deeply ingrained cultural preference. To spur alternative modes of commuting, we offered inducements — gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, a bookstore, even national chains. Yet, larger prizes such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars might have incentivized more participation. A progressive scale of prizes, from modest to grand, could have sustained engagement. The gift cards we started with seemed sufficient, but an announcement of grander prizes in December and January could have reversed the drop in February.",
            "In the realm of investment, an ETF, or exchange-traded fund, doth represent a curious beast. Unlike its index fund kin, it doth not merely mimic an index or a basket of assets, but trades like a stock upon the exchange. The ETF, much like a single stock, offereth flexibility and the ability to be sold short or bought on margin, all with the benefit of the lowest expense ratios among mutual funds. Yet, like the trading of stock, a commission is paid for each transaction involving an ETF.\n\nThe allure of such an investment lies in the diversity of funds available, akin to the myriad of paths in a forest. However, as with any path, it is prudent for the discerning investor to evaluate the true worth of the promises made. In this instance, we shall examine the ETF IHF, comparing it against the top ten holdings that constitute the bulk of its assets.\n\nTo facilitate our examination, we shall consider only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below are listed the top ten holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge the efficacy of these holdings in representing the ETF IHF, we shall employ the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return. The following chart presents these calculations.\n\nUpon reviewing the chart, it is clear that a portfolio composed solely of the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. Furthermore, the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings may offer a superior return with a lower risk. However, it is necessary to ascertain if the means of these portfolios are indeed statistically different.\n\nTo accomplish this, we shall determine the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the realm of Edgar Allan Poe's literary canon, \"Dream-Land\" stands as a paragon of sorts, a work that bears the unmistakable mark of his genius. Within its hallowed pages, he employs the term \"Thulé\" in verses six and fifty-six, a reference that traces its origins back to the annals of Virgil. Whispers of this mystical isle, north of Britain and at the edge of the known world, have echoed through the ages, but Poe's use of it in his poem is not a mere echo, but a deliberate invocation, a call to the reader to consider the darker corners of the mind and the heart.\n\nIt is certain that Virgil did indeed utilize this term, but there exists a more contemporary source to which credit must be given, one that bears the imprimatur of Poe's own literary pursuits. For Poe, the lands beyond Thulé were not simply the domain of distant islands and ancient scribes, but a bridge to the works of the German masters. Karl J. Arndt, in his exhaustive study \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between the two poets' works, suggesting that Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is a homage, a profound imitation of Goethe's \"Mignon.\"\n\nGoethe, a celebrated writer of poetic drama, penned \"Faust\" in two parts—the first in 1808, the second in the year of his death, 1832. Within the second part, a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" unfolds, a tale of a king who loses his queen, his will to live, and ultimately, his kingdom. The parallels between the king of Thulé and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are stark, a dark doppelganger of Poe's own struggles with loss and his crutch of drinking. Faust, composed into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, would have been fresh in Poe's mind, a mere year before he invoked the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe's references to Thulé are not mere coincidences, but deliberate threads woven into the tapestry of his collected works. He employs the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but it is in \"Dream-Land\" that Thulé serves as a bookend, a frame for his poetic endeavors. \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" can be read as companion pieces, mirror images of each other, bound by the dark hues of loss and despair. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker's descent into the land of Thulé is a descent into the abyss of his own psyche, a realm haunted by the specters of dead friends and shrouded in a world without color. It is as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem, a testament to the profound influence of the German master on Poe's literary journey.\n\nGoethe, with his vast body of work, would have been a significant presence in Poe's literary life, even if only through the mediation of other writers. Poe's own words on Tennyson, a writer he admired, suggest a respect for German literature that transcended the boundaries of language and culture. The reproductions and translations of Goethe's works, which were proliferating in Poe's time, would have led him to the shores of Thulé and the dark heart of Faust.",
            "In the law of California, a patron who finds themselves laid low by an applesauce spill in a grocery store might well claim punitive damages, if the manager's actions were found wanting in the court's eye. The law demands that to secure such damages, the plaintiff must prove the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the harm that would follow, and that the conduct was indeed despicable. For Jennifer Palmer, who slipped and fell, this is a reasonable case to make. Martin, the manager, had been warned thrice of the spill, yet held fast to his dinner, allowing the apple jelly to claim another victim.\n\nMartin's defense will be weak indeed. He had been informed of the slippery situation twice before, yet failed to act. Such inaction, when seen through the lens of six similar incidents in the year prior, does not bode well for his case. It is the kind of reckless disregard that courts do not take kindly to. For Palmer to win punitive damages, she need only prove that Martin knew the consequences of his inaction, and that his conduct was indeed despicable.\n\nConsider the events of October 13, 2009. At five o'clock, Wayne, an employee, notified Martin of the spill. The manager, midway through his repast, declared he had no time for such trivialities. Fifteen minutes later, Haddigan, another employee, relayed the same message. By half past five, Palmer was on the ground, her back forever changed. This is not a tale of simple negligence, but of willful disregard for the safety of others.\n\nIn this state, a plaintiff can seek punitive damages for conduct that is oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious, as defined by the law. The conduct in question must be despicable, and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. It is conduct that demonstrates a conscious disregard for the probable dangerous consequences of one's actions. And this, dear court, is precisely what Martin's conduct was.",
            "Four years hence, I undertook an examination of Islam at CBC, wherein the tumultuous debates centered on whether Islam harbored a hostility akin to that of a ravenous beast. The pertinence of this query seems to have only deepened in the annals of time since that fateful day of September eleventh. Observing the pendulum swing of media sentiment, I have witnessed a shift from the hostile to the tolerant, as if the lips of our nation had been kissed by a serpent's tongue and then by an angel's. In the year of our Lord 2001, could we have ever imagined a presidential candidate bearing the name Barack Obama, with a lineage that bore the mark of Islam?\n\nThe biography of our Prophet holds a peculiar allure, for it presents a tale of Muhammad that seems to defy the iron fist I had once believed him to wield. According to the annals of history, it was not the sword, but the word, that he used to convert the heathen tribes. His humility, it is said, was a beacon that drew the lost sheep to his flock. Yet, the contradiction gnaws at my soul like a rat at a carcass. For I am reminded of the Gospel, where the Son of Man performed miracles that were not mere parlor tricks, but demonstrations of His divinity. It is as if the chroniclers sought to mimic the lofty and divine, only to diminish the very essence of the Almighty.\n\nThe accounts are riddled with tales of converts, yet many of these narratives are secondhand, relayed through a chain of voices that grow fainter with each telling. This indirect approach, meant to validate the truth, serves only to cast doubt upon the veracity of the stories, like a shadow that darkens the light.\n\nWhat vexes me most is the effort to elevate Muhammad to a pedestal of godliness, a paragon of humility and wisdom. Yet, history, that unyielding chronicle, paints a portrait of a man of steel and fire, not the gentle lamb they portray. I cannot help but wonder if the adherents of Islam today are aware of the truth that lies buried beneath the sands of time.",
            "In the wake of His crucifixion, the teachings of the Nazarene were cast adrift, lost amidst the currents of Christian thought that flowed in the centuries to come. A cursory glance at history reveals a drift, a slow, steady drift from the original tenets of faith. The world today bears witness to a growing awareness, a progressive tendency that seems to know no bounds. While those who cling to tradition persist, their voice fades, their influence wanes. Yet, among the faithful, a hunger gnaws, a hunger to discern the doctrines that have been layered upon the religion as if it were a corpse, wrapped in cloths of dogma. This is not a fleeting fancy, but a tide that will sweep through the ages, reversing the clock of history. The clock that ticks backward, stripping away the accretions of time, will leave naught but a kernel, a core belief: the word of Jesus, the son of Mary, before any other hand wrote his name upon the scriptures.\n\nWhen this tide reaches the shores of the New World and the old, it will not be met by the resistance of tradition, but by the embrace of unity. For the church, as an institution, will stand tall and unyielding, a rock in the storm. But the clock will have reversed, and with it, the proliferation of diversity will give way to uniformity. The differences that once divided will give way to an echo of belief, a chorus of faith. History is a river, and it too has its reversals. From the persecution of the Christians by the Romans, to the rise of a Christian empire, to the transformation of a nation from the bonds of slavery to the hand of leadership, so shall it be in the arena of faith. The great reversion will unveil the source, and in its wake, it will undo the divisions that have festered like wounds. But this reversal will not be wrought by the literal interpretation of the Nazarene's words. No, it will be the metaphor that will lead us back to the heart of His message, to the wellspring of faith.\n\nAnd so, we must look back, far back, to the time before the Romans, to the time when the Jews were but a people, divided among themselves. For it was then that the foundation was laid, the core belief that would spark the fire, the monotheism that would be the light in the darkness. The Hebrew scriptures, divinely revealed, held the authority that would shape the world. But the people did not share one spirit, they were divided: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk. Yet, amidst these divisions, a seed was sown, a seed that would grow into the tree of faith we know today.",
            "In the grim heart of The Jungle, Upton Sinclair lays bare the cold, unyielding truth of human nature. It is a truth so stark and starkly bleak that it seems to cry out from the very gutters of Packingtown itself. The men who hold the reins of power, the owners and managers, they are but vultures, their eyes fixed on the horizon, hungering for more, more, always more. They care not for the wretched souls who toil in their factories, nor for the foul effluvium that chokes the air and poisons the earth. The factories stand like monstrous, blackened titans against the sky, their chimneys belching forth rivers of smoke, a constant, acrid testament to their disregard for life and nature. Sinclair paints a picture so vivid, so stark, that one can almost smell the acrid stench of the animals' waste and urine, and feel the bitter taste of the poisoned rain on one's tongue.\n\nThe men who wield power in this realm care not for the men who serve them. They are but cogs in a great, grinding machine, their worth measured in the dollars they generate. They work long hours in the stench and filth of the factories, their backs bent, their spirits broken, all for the fleeting promise of a dollar's worth of sustenance. And when the owners and managers deem it fit, they cast them aside like so much refuse, their lives and livelihoods discarded with as little concern as they would a used and torn rag. There were no protections then, no safety nets to catch the fallen. The unions, they were little more than bandits, preying on the weak and the desperate for a fraction of the crumbs that fell from the table of the mighty. The workers were slaves, in all but name, chained to their toil, their lives dictated by the whim of their masters. And so, they suffered, and they died, their bodies and their spirits broken, their lives snuffed out like the candles in the gloom of Packingtown. And still, the factories stood, and the owners and managers watched, their eyes ever fixed on the horizon, hungering for more, more, always more.",
            "In the vast tapestry of literature, authors employ manifold techniques to weave a particular atmosphere or tone around their subjects. Among these, F. Scott Fitzgerald's mastery in The Great Gatsby is a testament to the power of symbolism and the pairing of incongruous elements. Fitzgerald's use of color to evoke sentiment is particularly noteworthy. He imbues certain hues with profound significance, transforming them into vehicles for emotion and meaning.\n\nWhite and gray, in particular, are loaded with connotation in Fitzgerald's novel. White, often associated with purity and sophistication, is employed to signify the upper echelons of society, while gray, with its association to age and decay, represents the faded remnants of that upper class. This duality is evident from the outset. Daisy and Jordan, for instance, are consistently portrayed in white attire, while Nick's attire at Gatsby's party, a \"white flannel suit\" (41), underscores this theme of uniformity and privilege. Even the background, the \"white chasms\" (56) of lower New York, reinforces this idea. Conversely, the \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable and the \"gray cars\" (23) in the valley of ashes represent the ordinariness and transience of the lower class. The dog seller, too, is a \"gray old man\" (27), suggesting the decay and monotony of his life.\n\nFitzgerald builds upon this color imagery, subtly reinforcing their meanings throughout the novel. When Daisy is described as wearing a \"white dress\" (74), the reader is reminded of her uniform status as an object of Gatsby's affection, rather than a multifaceted character. The \"gray haze\" (18) of Daisy's fur collar further emphasizes this uniformity, as does her subsequent appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's altercation. This consistent use of white and gray to denote Daisy as a mere symbol of Gatsby's longing underscores Fitzgerald's ability to manipulate color to convey complex sentiments.",
            "In the arid expanse of San Diego County, the sun-baked earth yields a bounty of crops, nurtured by an unyielding climate. Tomatoes and citrus, leafy greens and squash, peppers and peaches, all flourish under the relentless sun. The land, a tapestry of chaparral and nonnative grasses, is a symphony of growth, where honeybees hum and birdsong echoes. The market for organic produce is robust, with a hunger for the pure and the natural, a niche that many have sought to fill, their waiting lists stretching on like a serpent's path.\n\nThe cost of this purity is steep, for the landowner must toil with hands and mind, not with the lazy reach of chemicals. Pests and weeds must be vanquished by the sweat of the brow, and the soil nourished with the wisdom of time and care. Losses are frequent, for the organic path is a winding one, fraught with uncertainty. But the rewards are manifold, for the land becomes a sanctuary, a haven for the wild, where the air is clear and the water pure. The landowner walks a tightrope, seeking balance between profit and preservation, between the needs of the market and the needs of the land.\n\nThe parcel in question sits on the edge of Potrero, a relic of a time long past, a testament to the tenacity of the human spirit. It is 160 acres of chaparral and oak woodland, next to the Cleveland National Forest, a haven for creatures great and small. The air is thick with the scent of pine and the whisper of wind through leaves, a symphony of life, where the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog still roam.\n\nThis land was once the domain of the indigenous people, their footprints echoing through the ages. Then came the ranchers, their cattle and their dreams, their axes and their fires. Now, the land lies fallow, a silent witness to the ebb and flow of time.\n\nThe landowner, a seeker of balance and a lover of the wild, has chosen this piece of earth as his canvas, his challenge. He scours the government's offerings, seeking aid and wisdom, a path to profitability and preservation. And so, he finds himself in the company of others, who have walked this path before, their farms nestled in the foothills, their fields a testament to the possibility of a different kind of future.",
            "Culture bears a certain weight on any discourse, like the ghost in the machine. It is not a singular thing, nor is it a simple equation. One must understand that culture is not a monolith, but a complex landscape, ever-shifting and ever-mystifying. It is as much about what it is not as what it is, and what it signifies. The notion that \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is as foolish as the man who believes the sun circles the earth.\n\nWhen one steps into the realm of another, they do not see a culture as an objective truth, but through the prism of their own. Comparisons are inevitable, and it is in these comparisons that understanding can begin. To grasp a foreign culture, one must first study its history, its prejudices, its ghosts. Not to judge or to change, but to accept, to respect, to work within its boundaries. For the negotiator who comes to the table with a weaker hand, the respect for tradition and belief is not just an adornment, but a lifeline.\n\nCulture is not confined to borders, but resides in the hearts and minds of men. Corporations, for instance, bear their own peculiar cultures, like islands in a sea. Some glorify long hours, others a more relaxed pace. It is in employee dress, communication style, hiring practices, even the charities they support, that a culture is revealed. The American corporate culture? It is a labyrinth, a landscape of diversity. Some cultures appear uniform, like a vast plain, but they too hide valleys and mountains.\n\nValues, they are the heart of a culture, the why behind the what. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, then the negotiator must tread lightly, lest he cause offense. If a hard-driven bargain is the order of the day, then patience is a virtue. Understanding these things before the negotiation begins is not just beneficial, it is essential. But a negotiator would be wise to learn something of his adversary, to peer into their soul, to make the negotiation more than just a dance of words.",
            "\"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.' So spake the Psalmist, and the same sentiment echoed in the mind of Saint Anselm, who sought to prove the existence of the divine through the lens of faith and introspection. As we traverse the path of these two learned men, we must first acknowledge their shared belief in the existence of the God of the Bible, lest we stray from the very essence of their arguments. To do otherwise would be like trying to compare night and day, for both men are firmly rooted in the belief that a single divine entity stands at the center of existence.\n\nAnselm's path is one of the spirit, a journey inward to find the proof of God within the confines of our own souls. He posits that the very notion of God's nonexistence is not something we can comprehend, for it lies beyond the realm of our understanding. The proof for God, then, is not to be found in the outside world, but within our own minds, where we innately know the truth. This is faith, the acceptance of that which cannot be proven by empirical means, yet is steadfastly believed.\n\nContrast this with the path of Saint Thomas Aquinas, who sought to prove the existence of God through reason and empirical evidence. He believed that no faith was necessary, for logic alone could persuade even the most skeptical. Five arguments he laid forth: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, each a logical necessity pointing to the existence of God. To him, the proof of God was as straightforward as knowing the missing piece of a puzzle, for the whole exists only because the missing piece is present.\n\nYet, both men, in their pursuit of truth, leave us with a question. For neither provides a holistic basis for belief in God. Their arguments, while strong and valid, fail to account for the complexity of faith and its role in our understanding of the divine.",
            "In the quietude of the fifth or sixth century before the common era, a prince was born, whom the world would come to know as Buddha. His journey led him to renounce the trappings of his birth and embrace enlightenment, birthing a creed that would become Buddhism—a faith that, in its Theravada iteration, boasts a history of nearly twenty-five hundred years. This path, however, is not static; it has evolved, much like the ancient Lanka where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, a ritual that bears little resemblance to Buddha's teachings. This transformation is not confined to mere traditions but permeates the very essence of the religion, as both monks and laymen must adapt to new doctrinal principles, shaped by forces that are as varied as they are relentless.\n\nTo navigate this discourse, let us define some key terms: Internal forces are those born of the followers of Buddha's teachings, regardless of their monastic status. External forces hail from those who are not Buddhist. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm the Buddhist community, driven by a warped perception of the faith. Benign forces, on the other hand, may inadvertently aid or hinder the community, their intentions often unclear.\n\nFirst, we must delve into the heart of Theravada Buddhism, its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the repository of Buddhist wisdom, contained within the Tripitaka—the Three Baskets. The Sutta Pitaka holds the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical underpinnings of Buddhism, including concepts like Anatta—the absence of a soul, Dukkha—the inherent suffering of life, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Recognizing these truths is the path to ending Sansara, the endless cycle of death and rebirth, and with it, the extinguishing of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, with laymen embracing five precepts and monks adhering to a myriad of disciplinary rules. At the religion's core lies the Four Noble Truths: First, the truth of Dukkha—the suffering inherent in life. Second, the truth of attachment as the cause of that suffering. Third, the truth that this suffering can indeed be overcome.",

[REDACTED] between these two nations continued, finally [REDACTED] just before the First World War. The [REDACTED] between the United States and Mexico began over [REDACTED] issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, and a [REDACTED] of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).

            "Fifteen years hence, a malady struck me, an affliction I'd not known to be lurking in the shadows of my health. I stood as a nurse, a role I'd chosen in the hope of finding solace in the steadfastness of my profession, for I'd felt the absence of such security in my youth. \"You'll always find work; people will always fall ill,\" they'd told me, and so, I'd yielded to the path of healing, though my heart yearned for the wilds of science or the ink-stained life of a journalist, a union of both worlds I'd once dreamt.\n\nYet here I am, at forty-six, alone, impoverished, and unable to toil. The years have passed, and though I draw breath, no wealth remains that I can call my own. Each day is a battle, a relentless onslaught on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing now is certain, yet one truth remains steadfast - my survival through these years owes much to my kin and a few steadfast friends, no matter how great my fortitude.\n\nAnd so, I say this: calamity will always find its way into our lives, be it great or small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well we prepare, some storms are too vast to weather alone.\n\nI concur that we, as Americans, must cease our reliance on the faltering leviathan of our government. Yet I pine for a return to trust, a resurgence of mutual aid and the sharing of resources. The rugged individualism that our forefathers lauded was not their salvation; it was the compassion, respect, and shared burden that bore them through trials.\n\nSo, let us be ready. I have stocked a cache of supplies, first aid, purifying tablets, and duct tape for the windows in times of biotic strife. I have prepared flashlights and batteries aplenty, candles and matches, and rations for the lean times.

            "Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there boundaries or constraints that steer the course of their evolution? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson proclaimed, \"Even now, the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" This sentiment holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to the growth of mollusk skeletons, tracing their development through time and lineage (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our investigation seeks to understand how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can illuminate the mechanisms guiding evolutionary-developmental change. We utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which we then modeled using CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). Hypothetical shell morphologies were constructed to interpret potential morphological shifts within Prunum. These findings are integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell, in its essence, is a tubular structure traversing 360 degrees of space over time. These revolutions, or whorls, spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which these whorls enlarge varies, with a continuous line separating each. This line is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last, or body whorl. The spire is the remainder of the shell, with the apex at one end and the base at the other. The animal extends from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"usual\" orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nA method for counting whorls entails first viewing the shell from the apical perspective, then locating the first suture and dividing the shell accordingly. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be perceived as a series of apertures tracing a path through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The trajectory of this aperture can be both graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",

            "Victorian novels, in their intricacies, are oft characterized by an unyielding focus on the minutiae of the aristocratic classes. However, two works, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, diverge from this mold, employing elements of mystery and the bizarre, atypical of the era's literary output. This divergence serves to illuminate the very souls of their characters, revealing their motivations and emotions in ways that transcend the somber elegance of their contemporaries.\n\n\"As the sun dipped low and the shadows lengthened, a host of confounding thoughts assailed him. He was once again in the grip of his pursuers, Sikes and Crackit, their voices echoing in his mind as if they still stood before him. He found himself speaking to them, as if the very words were his own. Then, a deafening report rent the air, and he was beset by a cacophony of shouts and cries. Lights danced before his eyes, a tumultuous symphony of chaos, and he was borne away, unseen hands thrusting him into the night. Through it all, a gnawing pain lingered, a constant torment that could not be ignored.\"\n\nThese novels employ this mystery through dreamlike states, each case varying in content and function. In Oliver Twist, these visions delve into the depths of Oliver's psyche, revealing his inner turmoil, his awareness of his plight, and the true nature of the world around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in Chapter 28, he relives the moment in vivid detail, as if trapped in a nightmare. The lack of control he experiences is underscored, as is his dire physical state, manifesting as hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he is borne away by unseen hands, the pain now a constant companion, linked with fear rather than surprise. This inability to control his fate raises questions about the unseen forces at work, for it was surely not his own will that led him here. A sense of defeat, of resignation, is palpable, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair, rendering him unable to react, even in his own defense.\n\n\"Days passed, yet they seemed but moments, as the sun dipped and rose once more, each time bringing with it a new dawn, yet also a new night, long in its silence, short in its passing.\"",
            "A few seasons past, I labored in a late-afternoon tutoring session, guiding young minds through the labyrinth of elementary subjects. My aptitude lay in the realm of English and the art of reading, a gift that I strove to share with those who sought it. A certain instructor, one who saw a need I could fill, directed me toward a young lad named Adrian, eking out his days in the third or fourth grade. His struggles with the written word were peculiar, such a peculiarity that it bore me to consider the strangeness of it all. This boy, a Latino by blood, spoke English as smoothly as a river.\n\nI was struck, as if by a stone from a slingshot, when I engaged his mother, a woman who knew only the tongue of her ancestors. With my meager grasp of Spanish, we communed, a dance of words and gestures. It was then that the truth revealed itself: Adrian could read, his mind a repository of stories and words, yet his grasp of the alphabet was as tenuous as a whisper in the wind.\n\nI share this tale to confront the specter of the language barrier that looms over our schools, especially in this forum of California. It is not always as plain as the nose on one's face. A child may speak English like the air around them, yet the act of reading it is a beast that can devour the unwary. We must address this issue, for it is clear that it exists. The solution for Adrian was simple: tutoring in the basics of English, aiding his grasp of letters and their sounds. But for those who barely know the tongue, the solution is a tapestry woven with the threads of complexity.\n\nThe dual language system is a boon, a beacon of hope for those whose first language is Spanish, but also for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically,\" I have read. Fears persist, that this is a squandering of resources, that the majority will reap no benefit. Let us not be swayed by these doubts. If we were to embrace this method as the norm, all children would gain from its wisdom. But how do we accomplish this? Do we demand bilingual teachers from each and every classroom? That would be a heavy burden to bear. Yet, why should we not employ special aides, tutors, whatever name one may give, who possess the gift of tongues?",

Some are sent to the House of God to learn its ways, while others seek solace in the quietude of their own hearts. Many embrace the faith passed down by their lineage, but some reject it utterly, their souls tethered only to the self. Yet, we all traverse our own paths, our own peculiar journeys of spirit. We search for a beacon in the darkness, a light to guide us from the shadows into the sun's embrace.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I inquired about his favored bird. We sat on the porch, the rain hammering against the tin roof like a thousand whispered secrets. The gutters sang a mournful dirge as they carried the rain away, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes filled with a gaze that was half-quest, half-remembrance. His frame had grown gaunt, his clothes hanging loosely upon him, and his hair thin and sparse. He stared out into the rain, avoiding my gaze. I felt alone, adrift, and unable to speak to my father of the void I felt, for words would only make it more tangible, more real. I embraced him, returned to my seat, and scooted my chair closer, joining him in his silent vigil as the rain whispered its sorrowful lullaby.\n\nMy father's journey to the end was swift, his passing in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The poison and radiation did not ease his suffering, but prolonged his agony a few more months beyond the doctors' predictions. Such a god, I thought, must be cruel.

If such a god existed, he had long since ceased to listen to me.\n\nI had not wished to witness my father's passage from this world into the next. So I did not. I could not bear to see the life that had created me fade away before my eyes. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not as he died. Besides, I knew my father better than his kin, better than his family, and knew he would not wish for his only child to be a witness to his end. I curled into a ball in my bed for three days, awaiting the news.\n\nNo call came.",
            "The Gothic Novel, a hybrid of ancient and modern, a \"Gothic oxymoron,\" as Ian Watt posits in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, has been both reviled and revered, accused of lacking depth yet celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, fused old theatrical elements with modern mimicry of nature to birth a new literary form, a 'Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). It clung to the medieval, even as the term 'Gothic' was used to describe anything archaic or unsophisticated. In this marriage of the theatrical Gothic and the personal novel, the genre endured, becoming both obsolete and newly discovered to later readers.\n\nOne persistent theme in Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry, the medieval knight's training, retained and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, with its ideals of bravery, honor, and competence, was held dear by Gothic writers, a stark contrast to their perceived societal decline. Walpole, amidst political turmoil and accusations, may have longed for the morality of yesteryears. This is evident in his characters, particularly Frederic, who embodies chivalric traits. Even before meeting him, the reader senses his gallantry, his tragedy, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of infidels. He is, in essence, an exaggerated 'gallant and courteous Knight,' a trope of Gothic excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the ceaseless flow of goods from the end of the customer's order, through the labyrinth of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, to the final destination. The concept was first coined in '82 by a consultant named Keith Oliver, a man who understood the necessity of planning, implementing, and controlling the myriad of processes that constitute the supply chain in order to sate the fickle palate of the customer.\n\nSix are the pillars of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the pieces of a vast machine that, when synchronized, can create a symphony of efficiency.\n\nProduction, the first step in this dance of commerce, is the cornerstone upon which the entire edifice is built. It is the task of the manager to divine the desires of the customer, a task made easier by the expansive market, a mirror reflecting the shifting whims of demand. Once the customer's needs are understood, the manager must choose what to produce and in what quantities. The location of production is next, a decision guided by the volume and quality of goods required, and the ebb and flow of customer satisfaction.\n\nAfter the lion's share of production has been allocated, the manager's gaze falls upon the scheduling and maintenance of the machinery, a task that demands precision and forethought. Each detail, from the smallest cog to the grandest wheel, must be accounted for, lest the machine grind to a halt and the company's coffers grow thin.\n\nSupply, the second key element, is the strategic decisions made to define the core capabilities of a facility and the partnerships forged, like rivers carving their path through the landscape. A company may possess many divisions, each with its own tools, workers, and specialties. The manager must select the division best suited for each task, or outsource the work to others, a decision born of necessity, a bid to create velocity, the swift and sure delivery of quality at a cost that is both low and low enough.",

            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in the realm of jazz is entrenched in his perpetual presence and his unyielding ability to shape his orchestra into a living, breathing entity. Though Ellington's touch upon the ivories is often subtle, his compositions are characterized by a depth and complexity that showcase the singular talents of his band members. As a composer, he forged a framework wherein soloists could roam freely, while also penning tightly woven pieces that drew out the unique styles of each musician, highlighting their musical voices like a master weaver might thread gold into his tapestry. His keen ear for the ensemble as a whole allowed him to fashion coherent, original sounds that danced to the rhythm of each composition.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its discussion on Ellington's sound and innovation, points to \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece, a deliberate twelve-bar blues, features call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smoothly and melodic, then transitioning to a rougher, more guttural sound. The muted trumpet solo in the second chorus elaborates on the melody and emphasizes those haunting blue notes that Ellington was so fond of. The clarinet solo in the third chorus sweeps through the high registers, backed by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase. The full band echoes the first chorus in the fourth, with a call and response between brass and reeds, while the fifth chorus introduces a high-register call and response from the reeds, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with the voice adopting the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument. A brief tag features a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending from the trombone.\n\nThe use of voice to add depth and tone to \"Creole Love Call\" is but one example of a stylistic trait that permeates Ellington's entire career. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, with Ellington employing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She'd always felt an insatiable hunger, a gnawing void that refused to be filled. It began when she was but a young buck, barely thirteen, and the hunger still hounded her at seventeen. 'Twas not for things she craved, but a presence, a being to fill the emptiness within. Yet, no youth seemed to stir her heart. They'd tried, God bless 'em, with their awkward wooing, but none had captivated her. She'd pondered this strange affliction, conjuring theories, yet none satisfied her curiosity. So, she lived, a wanderer in search of a haven.\n\nIn her home, she was a whirlwind, her parents' calm demeanor a stark contrast to her. They'd never argued, not even with their spirited daughter. She was a force to be reckoned with, their lively, likable girl, a beacon of their otherwise placid home.\n\nBut today, peace was shattered. As she prowled her abode, seeking inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. She rushed in, heart pounding, \"Mother?! Mother, what's amiss?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, moaning, \"Ow... sweet... take me... to the hospital.\" She lifted her, her strength tested, and bore her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's stench of death and illness permeated, but she barely noted it, her thoughts consumed by her mother's plight. She carried her in, called for aid, and left her to the doctors' mercy. Her mother had climbed atop a stool, reaching for a vase from the highest shelf, and tumbled down.",
            "In the desolation of the epidemiological expanse, a study was undertaken to illuminate the shadowed path between the Mediterranean Diet (Med diet) and the scourge of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The alternate Mediterranean diet (aMed), a variant of the Med diet characterized by an abundance of plant foods and fish, and a scarcity of animal products and saturated fats, was our compass. Moderation in alcohol, a mere fleeting indulgence amidst the austerity of plant life, was allowed.\n\nPrevious wanderings through the realms of epidemiological data had revealed an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and heart disease. Yet, the specter of stroke and stroke mortality remained in the shadows, unexamined.\n\nA cohort of 74,886 women, ranging from 38 to 63 years of age, unscathed by the ravages of chronic disease, were our subjects. Over the course of two decades, from 1984 to 2004, we traversed the landscape of their dietary habits,  guided by self-reported food frequency questionnaires. Six times we navigated this terrain, and each time, we calculated the aMed score, a measure of their dietary adherence. More than 95% of our subjects remained steadfast in their participation, a testament to their commitment.\n\nTo mitigate the vagaries of randomness, we calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score, ensconced within the cycles of the preceding years. We navigated the treacherous waters of confounding factors, adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nWith the aid of Cox proportional-hazard modeling, we charted the path between the aMed diet and the risks of CHD and stroke, both fatal and nonfatal. Over the two decades, we recorded 2391 incidents of CHD, 1763 incidents of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women who inhabited the upper echelons of the aMed quintile traversed a safer path, with a lower risk of both CHD and stroke, their relative risk reduced to 0.71.\n\nThus, in the pursuit of health, the Mediterranean Diet, a path less traveled, proved to be a beacon, guiding us towards a safer, healthier shore.",
            "In the year of the Lord two thousand and seven, the United States of America found itself in the throes of a calamity that would shake its very foundations. The once mighty economy, like a brittle tree in a storm, was felled by the harsh winds of financial ruin. Unemployment spread like a plague, the housing market crumbled, and many of America’s most august corporations were reduced to naught but bones. Alas, this recession continues to this day, and we must inquire: how did such a crisis come to pass, and how may we prevent a recurrence?\n\nBehold, the roots of this economic blight were sown in the late nineties, during the tenure of President Bill Clinton, who, like a hungry wolf, sought to extend his reign. His administration, in its zeal to maintain popularity and secure a second term, relaxed lending restrictions, thus paving the way for the sub-prime crisis that would engulf the nation seven years hence. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times spoke of the perils that lay ahead, warning that Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, might meet a similar fate as the savings and loan industry of the eighties.\n\nIndeed, the groundwork was laid for a disaster of epic proportions. Banks and corporations, driven by greed and ignorance, issued sub-prime loans to those ill-equipped to repay. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under pressure from the government and shareholders alike, repackaged these mortgages into complex financial instruments, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs). When the inevitable defaults occurred, the banks were left with insufficient capital reserves, and the chaos spread like wildfire to the economy at large.\n\nThe financial structure that underpinned this crisis was as intricate as a spider's web, with adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations all intertwining the economy with the housing market. This overexposure left households and financial institutions alike extremely vulnerable to even the slightest changes in price. The housing bubble burst, and the institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were consumed by the flames of their own excess.\n\nThe top five investment banks in the United States, together, reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for approximately thirty percent of the nation's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a pittance, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to submit to the yoke of intense regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September of the year two thousand and eight.",
            "Exposition, that unyielding specter looming over the page, the dreaded enemy of the earnest scribe. It's the moment when the writer takes to the skies, yet often plummets earthward, leaving behind a trail of boredom and disinterest. Dr. Merlin herself has been known to vent her spleen upon her keyboard, cursing the endless parades of words that serve no purpose but to drown out the true narrative.\n\nShow, don't tell, the wise adage echoes through the halls of literature, yet even the most seasoned writer stumbles, entangled in the snares of exposition. It's the whispering tempter that urges you to get the backstory out of the way, to hurry to the good parts, to tell the audience every detail that you think they need to know.\n\nExposition, in its simplest form, is the author's confession. It's the tales told by the old man in the corner, the whispers of the past, the core-dump of information meant to bore the unwary reader. It's the brother speaking to the sister, the husband to the wife, the world to the unknowing.\n\nConsider, if you will, the meeting of two souls, their love story etched in the fabric of time. The telling of their union, their love, their tragedy, should not be a mere recounting of facts. It should be a dance, a symphony, a testament to the bond that transcends the mundane. The husband's love should be evident in his words, his deeds, his very being. The heroine, too, should wear her affection like a badge, her thoughts and dreams reflected in the prism of his eyes.\n\nYet, too often, the writer rushes, eager to get to the point. The night manager of the gas station, once a man of the skies, now a provider of fuel and dreams. His past, his present, his future, all laid bare in a few, hastily scrawled lines. It's as if the author fears that the reader will tire, that they will not care for the man's journey, that they will not mourn his loss.\n\nBut the reader should care. The reader should mourn. The reader should feel the echo of the heroine's sorrow, the weight of the husband's memory. And so, the writer must provide that weight, that echo, that sorrow. They must provide the meat on the bare bone of the story, the substance that makes the bones dance. They must make the reader feel, must make the reader care. For without that, the words are but hollow shells, the story a mere echo of a tale.\n\nBut enough of these musings. Dr. Merlin must put down her quill, must turn her thoughts to other matters. The road ahead is long, the path uncertain. But for now, she leaves you with this: Write with purpose, write with passion, write with care. And above all, write with heart.",
            "I behold two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, in the grey light of morning. The first, a “live” affair, was NBC 4 on the thirteenth day of August, two thousand and eleven. A man named Shad Hostettler, from Ashley, Ohio, had drawn his blade against his wife, her name not spoken, only her fate. His mugshot, a visage of pure darkness, stared back at me from the screen. They gave him but two minutes, a fleeting moment in the annals of evil.\n\nThe second tidings were of an early morning shooting, a young man named Travis Buyers, shot in Sharon Woods, critically wounded. No arrests, no suspects, save the SWAT team, prowling like predators in the dawn. This tale, too, was brief, and I could not help but notice the silence that enshrouds the black man's cry. The media's gaze, it seems, is a fickle mistress, turning away from the minority's plight when it should be thunderous with outrage.\n\nThen came the tale of a bullet's path, a .22 caliber from some unseen rifle, that had marred a Med-Flight helicopter. Crime-Stoppers dangled a tenuous carrot, five thousand dollars for the shooter's capture. A teaser, they called it, for the day's storms, which they promised would bring the weekend's heat to a simmer.\n\nA robbery, a dark-skinned man, a hooded sweatshirt, a store on Clime Road. The description was a canvas of darkness, his hue emphasized with a fervor that seemed to dance on the edge of obsolescence. Twenty-five years in prison, they said, but hid behind a shroud of numbers, \"300\" months, as if the very sentence were a mask.\n\nLastly, a man named Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin, sentenced to the dark heart of Ohio's prisons. His name, his face, his hue, a mere garnish to the tale of his crimes.",
            "There be a bond between brothers, a tethering unyielding as steel. Within its coils, emotions writhe and twist: love's fiery embrace, pride's cold, hard grip, jealousy's acid bite, cruelty's brutal edge. Brothers know each other's faces as if they were their own reflection. In storm's eye, they are laid bare, good or ill. The cost, it is steep, these feelings born of kin. To see oneself in another's eyes, one sees not how others see them, but as they truly are. It is in actions and their fruits that a man's soul is laid bare. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two such brothers ply their course, through verdant, vivid land. Disappointment bitter as gall collides with pride fierce as a wildfire in the end, and but one brother finds life's breath. The bond's theme is stitched into fabric of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions, as well as the voice of the teller, which bears the tangled feelings the boy feels, and his view of the world, which shapes his steps.\n\nThe boy's heart, it is a furnace, burning with pride. From the first time he and his brother, Doodle, took to the wilds, to the last, fatal hunt, resentment smolders within him. He desired a brother to share his world, teach his skills: breath-holding, running, climbing the Old Woman Swamp's vines. He yearned for a companion to race to Horsehead Landing, perch with in the pine's highest fork. But fate dealt him a harsh hand, Doodle born with a heart weak as paper. The boy's dreams, they crumbled like sandcastles. Anger gnaws at him, as he ponders smothering his brother with a pillow. Such thoughts, they are chilling, yet hope comes when Doodle smiles. His heart, it softens, and love, it stirs. Perhaps his hate was not eternal, for in his soul, a love for his brother lay dormant.",
            "The human brain, a labyrinthine crucible of creative thought, has been likened to sundry implements of language and artifice as time has unspun its thread. Once a humble wax tablet, then a scroll of papyrus, it has been compared to a book, a volume of words and tales, and now, in these modern times, to a contraption of metal and glass, a machine that hums and whirs with the promise of order and control. But let us not forget, the metaphor, like a map, is but a guide, not the territory itself. For the brain is a wilderness of unknowable vastness, teeming with processes that defy our understanding.\n\nInformation, like a river, flows into the brain through the gates of our senses. The eyes see, the ears hear, the skin feels, the nose smells, the tongue tastes. Physical sensations, transformed into electrochemical impulses, dance in the brain's hallowed halls. Upward and downward, the information is processed, woven into patterns of meaning. In the grand ballet of perception, the simple data of color and shape, of sound and touch, coalesce, as if by some unseen hand, into a coherent whole. The brain, in its wisdom, speeds the process, drawing upon past experiences, upon the knowledge it has already amassed, to make sense of the world anew.\n\nAttention, that fickle mistress, decides the fate of the information that passes through the brain. Like a shepherd guiding his flock, it chooses which bits of knowledge to highlight, which to ignore. The blades of grass beneath our feet pass unnoticed, a blur of green and brown, while a name, spoken in a crowded room, stands out, clear as day.\n\nMemory, the brain's vast repository of knowledge, is a many-towered citadel, each tower serving a different function. Sensory memory, fleeting as a dream, holds the information of our immediate experiences. Working memory, that tenuous bridge between the past and the present, maintains the information for a brief span of time. And long-term memory, the grand library of our lives, stores the knowledge that shapes us, that makes us who we are.\n\nModels of the brain's knowledge, like ancient maps, have attempted to chart its many rivers and valleys. Some are drawn from the tales of human experience, others from the language of computers, still others from the whispers of the brain's own neurology. The semantic network, for instance, posits that knowledge is organized in a lattice of interlinked nodes, each node representing a concept, each link a trace of relatedness. Thus, \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which in turn is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth, a web of meaning that stretches out in all directions.\n\nBut beware, dear seeker of knowledge, for the brain, like a wild beast, resists easy understanding. It is a country of night and mystery, of fire and ice, where the road ahead is always shrouded in fog. Yet, it is a land of wonder and beauty, a place where the most profound truths lie hidden, waiting to be discovered.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" the specter of technology and its capitalist underpinnings is laid bare through the lens of a dystopian society where community and immediate gratification are elevated above individuality. The populace is conditioned from birth, their lives dictated by a World Controller who manipulates their desires and their beliefs. This is no mere exercise in social critique, but a Marxist meditation on the very nature of power and its perversions. The novel's terminology - homogeny, reification - echo the author's unease with the encroaching economic systems of his time.\n\nCapitalism, Huxley suggests, is a false consciousness, a veil that blinds the masses to their true economic relationships. The common folk, the Deltas, the Gammas, are mere cogs in the machine, their wills subsumed by hypnopædia, their desires channeled into consumption. The World Controller wields hegemony, an invisible hand that guides the lower classes into accepting their place. The Alphas and Betas, born with the capacity for awareness, remain complacent, content to accept their lot, few exceptions like Bernard questioning the status quo.\n\nIn this world, relationships are shallow, emotions stifled. Love does not exist, only the superficial. The males' comments are reduced to the physical, the females' encounters matter-of-fact. Social hierarchy is accepted with absolute obedience, each class content in their place, a testament to Marxist thought on the proletariat's false sense of superiority. The rise of technology and capitalism, Huxley seems to say, is a death of free will and expression, a world where the individual is lost in the collective.",
            "I've toiled at University Park for nigh on two and a half years, or four semesters. The sprawl of campus, it seems, is a vast and unyielding beast, and traversing it can be a trial. Freshman year, I was quartered in East Halls, the eastern extremes of the university, save for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The Willard Building, nestled near the heart of campus, was a distant quest, a journey that could take up to a quarter-hour by foot, if the weather was unkind, as it oft was in State College. An alum, barely grown from boyhood, told me that once, the East Halls were a lonely outpost, surrounded by vast tracts of empty land. Now, that barren space is claimed by sports fields, new edifices like the Creamery and health services building, and apartments. As the campus grows, so does the burden of travel. What is the remedy? The bicycle, a silent, swift companion. Yet, bikes will not suffice if the campus does not bend to their need.\n\nI spoke with a friend who, after a long sojourn, took to the roads once more. \"Bikes are the only way,\" he said, \"the wind in your hair, the world at your feet.\" It is a truth as plain as the sun, that bicycling is the most efficient way to traverse the world. A humble bowl of oatmeal and a few turns of the pedals can take you far. Like many of my fellow students, I dwell off campus, as far from the heart as some dorms. This year, my wisest decision was to claim a bike. The Thomas Building, my daily destination, would take me a quarter-hour's walk, but a swift ride on two wheels can reduce that time to a mere five minutes. The road is not always kind, Pollock Road, a straight, unyielding path, yet it remains the shortest route. Walking, yes, but I have not the time. Without my bike, walking would be my only recourse, a journey that would claim an extra half-hour each day, a weekly toll of more than two hours. Add to that the time spent walking to and from classes, appointments, the like, and the weight of time is more than I can bear."
