            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

Service. Respect. Ethics. These are the stones upon which the house of social work is built.  Not just for the work, but for the man I wish to be.  Always, there was a pull towards helping. But the path remained shrouded. I saw too many souls fleeing their shadows, others seeking solace in hollow bargains. Witnessing these things, I turned to psychology. A degree earned, but the path still unclear. A summer stretched before me, a time for reckoning. A friend, a couch, a boy of sixteen, eyes wide with fear. He spoke of parents, of shadows in the home. The next day, the boy called for help, a bridge thrown across the chasm of his despair. I drove to the house, a tremor in my hands. I spoke to the officers, shared what I knew, the weight of my recent studies pressing upon me. But the law, it held its hands. They needed a different kind of truth. I spoke to the parents, their eyes flickering like dying embers. Evasive words, excuses wrapped in the cloak of blame. A child’s pain, dismissed as manipulation. That day, the path hardened, etched in the dust of their denial. \n\nJustice. A word whispered in the wind, but seldom heard.

A shipwreck, a perilous journey, and a world that offered no solace to a woman alone.  \n\n\"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\" she says, \"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" Her words hang in the air, a testament to the fragility of her existence.\n\nBut the mask, it takes hold. It becomes a fortress, shielding her from harm, but also cutting her off from the solace of her own kind.  And in this twisted labyrinth of deception, she finds herself entangled with the nobleman Orsino, his heart drawn to the phantom she has become.\n\n\"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times,\" he sighs, \"Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nThe play dances with ambiguity.  Is Olivia drawn to Cesario because he is a man, or is there a deeper truth lurking beneath the surface?  Is this a reflection of the times, a mockery of societal constraints?  \n\nThe answer, perhaps, lies in the shadows.  \"A sister, you are she,\" Olivia declares at the end. The mask has fallen, the truth revealed. But the question remains: what price has been paid for this unveiling?",
            "The German hand, it left a mark on the land. A harsh one. The whispers speak of the Nama and the Ovaherero, wiped clean. A stain on the empire's ledger, a testament to the cruelty it could wield. But empires are not singular things. They breathe a multitude of airs, wear many masks. The German reach, it stretched far and wide, its policies as varied as the dust and the sun that beat upon its colonies. Education, that seed of knowledge, found fertile ground in some places, a barren waste in others. The Brits, when they took hold of East Africa, they found a people already touched by learning, their minds aflame with the torch of literacy. In Kamerun and beyond, the Germans, they too, spoke of progress, of the educating hand.\n\nBut South West Africa, that land of harsh beauty, it held a different tale. No state-sanctioned schools there, no grand structures of learning. The burden of education, it fell upon the shoulders of the missionaries, their meager efforts funded by a government that turned its gaze elsewhere. The white man, he was the recipient of a different kind of care. The Germans, they built schools for their own, nurtured their minds, their tongues, their souls. A double standard, etched in stone and dust.\n\nThe echoes of this divide, they linger still. While other lands boasted a tapestry of literate minds, South West Africa remained cloaked in darkness. The majority, they remained untouched, uneducated, their voices lost in the wind. The reasons, they are many, woven into the fabric of history. This paper, it seeks to unravel those threads, to shed light on the hearts and minds of the settlers, the colonial masters, and the natives they sought to control. \n\nThe past, it whispers, and we must listen.  Little has been written about the German empire, but what exists, it speaks volumes. The early accounts, they are like ghosts, their voices faint, their words written in a language that once held sway. They describe the systems, the methods, the failures. Later voices, they emerged from the shadows, comparing, contrasting, dissecting. They tell a story of disparity, of two colonies on a single continent, their fates entwined yet forever separate. Cohen, his name rings out, his work a beacon in the darkness. He saw the truth, the stark reality of South West Africa, a colony where education was a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe land itself, it offered a different kind of solace. Not a paradise, no. But a land of moderate temper, a respite from the scorching sun that blistered other lands.  Whites, they flocked to its shores, drawn by the promise of a new life. By 1913, they were fifteen thousand strong, a small army of settlers, a testament to the allure of the unknown.",
            "The music they call popular, it’s swelled like a river over a century, branching into a thousand tributaries.  Names for these branches, names for the music, they’re hard to catch, they slip through your fingers like water.  Rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – all of them, names just to make sense of the flood. And each one, they’ve spun their own webs of sub-streams, sub-sub-streams, a tangled delta of sound.\n\nHeavy metal, that’s one branch that’s grown thick and wild.  Forty years, maybe more, it’s been churning, churning up the darkness, churning out emotion raw and unfiltered. It’s not pretty, not always. It’s the kind of music that claws at you, that bleeds from the cracks in the world.\n\nThey’ve carved out niches in it, more than you can count.  A thousand shades of black, a thousand ways to scream.  What is metal then? Where does one branch end and another begin? It’s a question that hangs in the air, heavy as the guitar riffs.\n\nIt’s a movement, not just a genre. Metal is born of darkness, of the things we keep buried deep. More bass, more volume, more dissonance. It’s the music of excess, the music of the primal scream.  Skill, too, there’s a kind of mastery in the way they wield their instruments. They know how to play, and they play hard.\n\nAnd it’s fueled by something else, something dark and ancient. Drugs, they whisper, they were the fuel for the fire.  A fever dream in the seventies, a haze of possibility and despair. They say it’s in the music, the echoes of a lost world, the screams of a generation.\n\nBut it’s more than just drugs. Metal’s roots run deep, back to the Romantics, to the poets who sang of the night and the shadows. It’s a reflection of the darkness we all carry inside, the things we try to hide.\n\nTake the Beatles, even they dipped their toes in the dark. “Helter Skelter,” they called it, a song that spins like a runaway train, a descent into chaos.  Maybe it was the drugs, maybe it was something else, but it was a crack in their polished image, a glimpse of the darkness that lurks beneath.",
            "The Surrealists came after him, painting dreams on canvas. But Henri Rousseau, the postman painter, he was crafting his own dreams long before.  His *The Dream*, a canvas painted in the year nineteen ten, it ain't just a woman staring at the wonders of a dreamland. It's Rousseau himself, staring at the wonders he dreamed of, the recognition, the acceptance, the praise.  A painter with dreams like a burning ember in his chest, he yearned for the world to see his vision. But the world, it was a harsh mistress, demanding conformity, mimicking the styles of the day. \n\nRousseau, born in Laval, France, a son of a tinsmith, his life was a canvas of hardship. No schooling in the arts, just the drudgery of toll booths and the sting of loss. His wife, Clémence, gone, eight children lost, only Julia remained. Painting became his refuge, his solace. But the art world, it was a cold place. He toiled away, while Matisse and the others climbed the ladder of fame. \n\nJan Gordon, he wrote about them, two painters on different paths. Matisse, afraid to paint the trite, Rousseau, yearning for the familiar, for a place amongst the *Artiste Français*. He wanted to paint the way they wanted to see, to be accepted, to be seen. But inside, the dream was wild, untamed, a reflection of the man himself.",
            "Many a mind has pondered the bridge 'tween right and beauty, truth and grace. A kinship there be, a reason deep. Keats, in his ode to the urn, sang it clear: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn the ways of the world through book and experience, but these matters of ethics and aesthetics, they seep into us like the rain. They ain't taught, they're felt.  \n\nBoth strive to describe, not dictate. We study morality and beauty, trying to unravel the why of a brushstroke or a deed, not to lay down the law for what's good or bad. A man might talk for hours 'bout the Mona Lisa, dissecting color and shadow, but he'll never catch the heart of it.  You ask a man 'bout his favorite song, his favorite tale, and he'll say, \"There's just something about it,\" before he can string words to explain the rest. Art and morals, they ain't sumthin' to be wholly captured, like a fly in amber. O'Connor, she knew this well: \"A story is a way to say somethin' that can't be said any other way.\" No matter how we dissect it, there's somethin' left unsaid, somethin' that hangs in the air. Ethics, it's the same. Wittgenstein, he said it plain: \"Ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nMorality and art, they touch us in a way that's beyond words, a noumenal thing. They seep into the soul, leaving a mark that can't be erased. Literature, it's a double shot of this truth. McKean, he called it \"the moral quality\" that sets it apart.  We live by values, and literature holds them up to the light, letting us see them clear.",
            "The sun bleeds over the Alps, staining the snow-capped peaks a bruised purple.  Down in München, the air is thick with the murmur of a thousand tongues, each a thread spun into the tapestry of German culture.  It stretches east, a ribbon of language and custom, winding its way past the Rhineland, past Köln, where the great river sighs, past Dresden, where the Elbe whispers tales of a long-gone Saxony.  This land, forged in the fires of a thousand winters, is a crucible where tribes have clashed and mingled, their stories woven into the very fabric of the earth.\n\nGermania.  The name itself hangs heavy, a ghost from a forgotten time. Scholars, like moths drawn to a flickering flame, have scratched and clawed at its origins, seeking to unravel the secrets it holds. Tacitus, that old Roman scribe, claimed it came from the Tungrians, a tribe that crossed the Rhine, their steel singing in the clash against the Gauls. Caesar, the conqueror, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his chronicles of war, a word snatched from the Gauls themselves, a tool to divide the conquered from the unconquered. Some whisper it came from a spear, the \"ger\", a weapon of wood and iron, others from the guttural cries of battle, a roar that echoed across the plains.\n\nThe old Roman, Tacitus, in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", painted a picture of a people untouched by the tides of migration, a race abiding in their ancient home.  \"I should regard them,\" he wrote, \"as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\"  He saw a land unforgiving, a land of wild winds and sullen skies, a land where only the most hardy would dare to dwell.\n\nBut Rome, ever hungry for conquest, sent its legions to the borders of Germania, their legions hungry for gold and glory. They traded, they fought, but they never truly settled.  The Germanic tribes, fierce and proud, held their ground, their axes ringing against the Roman shields. They traded the bounty of their forests, their furs and their skills, and some even joined the ranks of the Roman legions, their loyalty bought and paid for.",
            "The view unfurled below, a dark and silent thing. I looked, my mind a vacant space. No thoughts took root, no judgments formed. Just the raw image, laid bare. Like water flowing, the impressions came and went, leaving no trace. \n\nAn old book lay open on my palm. \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" An artist's counsel, a promise of skill.  To see, to understand the lines, the shapes.  The world as a flat plane, a bowl of fruit suspended on nothingness. I'd tried that once, with a bowl of fruit, a kitchen, a room beyond. But the sight had swallowed me whole. A blue man, a green world, a rainbow of flesh.  If mine was to be a story, this was its canvas, its first brushstroke. Brown.\n\nThe tool felt heavy in my hand. Muscle memory took over, a practiced dance. But the water, it flowed and swirled, clear as a winter sky. And a speck, a fleck, a piece of myself, breaking free.  Then a spasm, a jolt, a desperate push. The porcelain held fast. Soiled and silent, a message left for the unseen.\n\nMop in hand, tie tight, I faced the aftermath. A curtsey to the mundane, a ritual of the uncelebrated. Flush, flush, the water churning. The world shrinks, then expands. A sheet, a glove, a pale shield. Slowly, deliberately, I dipped in. A mother's touch, a deathly embrace.",
            "Teenagers die behind the wheel. A confluence of factors pull them down, a dark vector in the statistics of young Americans. The Institutes, they say, the brain ain't built for it, not yet. Not ready for the road's cruel geometries. \n\nInEXPERIENCE, they call it.  And it's the heart of the matter. \nMore than just crashes, more than the mangled metal and broken glass.  It's the young ones who roll over, who push too hard, who drift off the asphalt's edge.  \n\nThey ride with their kind, these young ones.  Always with each other, like moths drawn to a flickering light.  The Californians, they studied it.  Age of the passenger, the accidents, a grim correlation etched in the data.\n\nThey've tried, these states, to build some kind of cage around them.  Provisional licenses, they call them, with hours and restrictions and limits. But a cage is just a cage.\n\nThe real problem, it cuts deeper.  They're not ready.  Not by the numbers, not by the measure of their own making.  Zuckerman, the psychologist, he says eighteen's too young.  Too young for the weight of the wheel, the responsibility of steel and rubber on asphalt.  They crave the rush, the sting of danger, a thrill that feels like living.  They're hungry for it, these young ones.\n\nAnd so they die.\n\nWe can't keep letting them die.  Laws, they say.  Schools, they say.  Education, they say. But the answer is simpler, starker.  \n\nWait.  Wait until the hunger fades, until the need for the rush subsides.  Wait until the numbers change, until the roads are safe again.\n\nWe owe them that much.  The dead, they owe us nothing.",
            "The Library of Congress, a repository of dust and echoes, held a trove of Edison’s earliest visions. Fifteen trick films, flickering ghosts from 1895 to 1901. Illusions spun from the raw threads of editing. My study, a sifting through these phantoms, sought to map the poetics of their artifice, to find the outliers, the whispers of something more. The trick film, a creature of its time, was bound to the stage. A frontal proscenium, a fixed gaze. No camera to wander, to chase. Long shots, medium shots, the actors confined to a horizontal dance, their fate sealed within the frame. One shot, one film. A rigid decree. \n\nBut even in this cage, there were tremors. A few, at the dawn of the century, dared to breach the walls. Multiple shots, a glimpse of something beyond the bounds. \n\nThe proscenium, a stage within a stage, was their prison and their stage. The camera, a silent sentinel, never shifted its gaze.  Bound by the theatre, by vaudeville’s shadow, by the conjuror’s art. Movement was a sideways sway, a waltz across the stage’s edge. Take “Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,” a film from 1900. The actors, trapped in their spectral dance, move left and right, vanishing and reappearing, but never venturing towards or from the camera’s cold eye. \n\nLong shots, the vast majority. Medium shots, a fleeting respite. Close-ups, the intimacy of the human face, absent. The audience, like the stage, witnessed everything, framed by the immutable borders.\n\nOne conceptual shot, one film. A minute or less, a fleeting glimpse of a world built on illusion. A vaudeville trick, a disappearance, a sleight of hand. A story, if there was one, was thin, a wisp of smoke. \n\nYet, in the eye of the beholder, a single shot could be a tapestry.  A joining of fragments, a conjuring of the impossible. Look closer, at “The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,” a film from 1895. The severed head, a phantom limb, a moment of physical reality in a world of artifice. One shot, the camera never blinks, but the illusion is built on pieces, on the careful joining of fragments.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the soil, was a firebrand for Republicanism, his voice ringing out for freedom and the land. Though a farmer by trade, his calloused hands held the weight of a life steeped in politics, a life etched by the struggle against tyranny. His faith, absolute, rested in the agrarian way, a way of life he saw as the cornerstone of true liberty.  It was this conviction, this reverence for the tiller, that colored his pronouncements on sovereignty, on the Constitution's sacred parchment, even on the men who sat in judgment.\n\nHe saw in the newly formed nation a chance, a clean slate, unburdened by the ghosts of old world systems.  With no inherited lineage to bind them, the architects of this government could build anew, a republic of self-reliance, a testament to the inherent rights of man.  These rights, he believed, were woven into the very fabric of existence, each one indivisible, each one a thread in the tapestry of freedom. To deny one was to unravel them all, leaving the remaining threads tattered and weak.\n\nThe state, he argued, was a necessary evil, a bulwark against the darkness within man, the primal struggle between good and evil that raged within every soul.  He saw in the human heart both the capacity for great good and the potential for monstrous deeds.  \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.\"  His vision of a righteous government rested on principles that protected property, nurtured the land, and tempered the excesses of capital. A government, he believed, built on such principles would endure, its administration fleeting, a mere shadow cast by the eternal light of justice.\n\nTaylor, like many of his brethren, called for a strict reading of the Constitution, a razor's edge against the encroaching tide of federal power. He saw in a bloated government the seeds of tyranny, a leviathan fueled by avarice and consumed by its own appetites. Yet, he cautioned against a blind adherence to the letter of the law, for without understanding the intent of the framers, the words could become a weapon, twisted and corrupted.  He looked to the Declaration of Independence, the true testament of the nation's birth, as a guiding light, a beacon reminding them that the states were sovereign, not pawns in a centralized game.",
            "The numbers dipped in the third month, a sharp fall like stones from a high ledge. Figure 17 shows it plain. Why? The wind turned cold, winter coming on, a New England bite. Bikes and feet, they stay in the shed. December. The semester's end, a scramble for grades, for knowledge and completion. A log gets misplaced in the rush.  And then the holidays, a long dark peace settling over the campus. Students gone, faculty too, no need for paths to tread. Come January, classes start up again, a trickle of logs. But February, that's a mystery.\n\nPerhaps the fire of new things burns bright, then fades. A natural thing. To counter that, we built a fire anew, a week of challenges, a blitz of carpooling.  The logs climbed, a flicker of hope in March.  But the heart of the matter, the challenge, was to keep the flame burning. Winter's chill, the breaks in the year, they all pull at the soul, make it hard to keep going.\n\nAnother thing, people like their cars. It's the way they move, free as the wind. A deep thing, woven into the fabric of this land.  So we offered gifts, tokens of appreciation:  coffee, meals, a rub of the back, books, even the trinkets of the chain stores.  Maybe something bigger would have worked, a bicycle, a car that breathed clean air, a promise of the open road. Would it have kept the logs full? Would it have caught the fire again?\n\nThe gifts stayed the same, a steady thing. But what if they grew, a slow crescendo? A bicycle here, a car there, announced in the cold months.  A promise of something more, a beacon in the darkness.",
            "The thing they call an ETF, an Exchange Traded Fund, is a kind of paper promise. It's built to follow the moves of a market index, or maybe a single commodity, or a basket of things like some kind of index fund. But it's quicker, slicker. Trades like a stock, on the board, with all the flash and the risk.  \n\nYou get the spread of the index, the supposed safety in numbers, but with the bite of a single stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, even own just a sliver, a single share, if that's all you got.\n\nThey say it's cheaper, these ETFs, the fees lower than the mutual fund kind. But there's a price, always a price. Every trade, a commission, like a toll to pass through the gates. \n\nAnd the choices, they've got a whole damn army of these ETFs, each one promising something different. But a smart man, a man who knows the way the world turns, he knows to ask: do these promises hold water? Does the spread truly exist, or is it just another illusion?\n\nWe're lookin' at one, IHF they call it.  We're gonna cut through the noise, focus on the top ten.  They hold most of the weight, 63.58% of the whole damn thing.\n\nTo see if these ten hold the same promise as the whole ETF, we gotta look at their fingerprints. We'll measure their Beta, their risk, and their Return, see if they paint the same picture as the whole shebang.\n\nWe'll lay it all out: the numbers, the percentages, the risks and the rewards.  Because in this game, the truth ain't always what it seems.",
            "Dream-Land. One of Poe's own pronouncements, a better poem. But the word Thule, it hangs there, twice in the piece, a ghost from Virgil's pen. Mabbott, he says it's Virgil, an island north of Britain, the edge of what men knew. And Virgil did use it, yes. But there's a shadow, a closer echo. Poe, he hungered for the German tongue.  \n\nArndt, he saw the kinship, in Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon. A borrowed melody, a likeness in the dark. The Oxford Companion, it speaks of Goethe, the man who spun the tapestry of Faust, a tale in two parts, first in '08, the second on the day he breathed his last, '32. Within that second part, a poem, The King of Thule. A king, his queen gone, a goblet offered, a poisoned gift. He drinks, he weeps, a hollow man, and in the end, he walks to the edge, the goblet flung to the sea, eyes closed, and the darkness claims him. \n\nTwo shades, the King of Thule and the man in Dream-Land, a mirror held to Poe's own sorrow, the whisky a solace. Faust, it was brought to the stage by Grattan, just a year before Poe's own Thule in The Pit and the Pendulum. \n\nTwice does Poe speak of Thule, once in the darkness of The Pit, and twice in Dream-Land, bookends to his dream. Companion pieces, they are. The speaker in Dream-Land, he walks through the landscape of Thule, a world drained of color, a haunted place. The King of Thule, he too is haunted, his loss a wound that bleeds.\n\nGoethe, a giant in Poe's world, a presence felt even through the respect Poe held for Tennyson.  The world teemed with Goethe's words, echoes in the wake of his own.",
            "The law in this California dust bowl says a man hurt by a slick of applesauce on the floor of a market might be owed more than just his medicine. He might be owed a reckoning. The question is, would the law see malice in the manager's eyes, a cold disregard for the man's well-being?\n\nJennifer Palmer, that's the woman who took a tumble.  She says the manager, Martin, knew about the spill. Knew it twice. Told by two different souls, one named Wayne, the other Haddigan. But Martin, he was on his own supper, and said he had no time for the cries of customers. Half an hour passed. The spill remained. Then Palmer came along. She fell hard, her back a cracked thing now.\n\nThe law speaks of malice. It speaks of a willfulness, a knowing disregard. And it speaks of a conduct so base, so foul, it's barely human. Could the manager be said to have done this with malice aforethought?\n\nThe six slips and falls that had happened that year at this same store, the same aisle, their story hangs in the air like the smell of rot.  Did Martin see those past falls and turn away? Did he see the danger and choose to ignore it, to profit off the chance of another's pain?\n\nWe're looking at the law here, the cold law. We're looking for the lines, the boundaries of what can be called malice. Did this manager act with a heart of stone? That's the question that hangs over this case, heavy as a storm cloud in the valley.",
            "Four years gone now, a course in Islam at CBC.  A fire in the classroom, the question burning: was it a faith of hostility? Now more than ever, the question hangs heavy.  Seen it shift, the media's view. From the shadow of the towers, a hatred, a fear.  Then a turning, a tide of tolerance, a turning so swift it scarcely seems possible. Now, a man named Obama, a name like a whispered prayer, a man of faith, stands in the light of the highest office. Could that have been in 2001?\n\nThe Prophet's story, it's a riddle.  What I knew, what I thought I knew, was a man of conquest, a sword raised. Tribes subdued, forced to bend the knee, to swallow the faith.  But this biography, it paints a different picture.  A man humbled, misunderstood, a martyr.  Truth, it whispers, not force.  People drawn to him, seeking the light.\n\nThe echoes, they are there. Jesus and Muhammad. The loaves and fishes, a mirror held to the desert.  Forty men fed, a hand raised, a miracle.  It's a way of telling the story, a way of making him seem less, a man of quiet faith, of truth lived, not proven.  But the truth, it cuts like a knife. It doesn't discount the miracle, the life, the man who walked on water. It's a shadow cast, a theft, a reaching for the light of another.\n\nAnd the witnesses, the stories told and retold, a game of telephone.  He said, she said, whispers in the wind.  A third party, a shroud over the truth, a cloud of doubt.  It's supposed to prove, to solidify, but it does the opposite.  It unravels, it weakens.\n\nThe thing that sits heaviest is the way they try to build him up, Muhammad, a saint, a gentle soul.  History, it whispers a different tale.  A man of power, a man of ambition.  Do they, the faithful, know the truth?  Do they know the man beneath the legend?",
            "The man’s words, the words of the Nazarene, they drifted away like dust on a wind.  The Church, like a river swollen and twisting, bore him onward, past the quiet pools where his words had first been spoken.  A strange turning, this.  The world now pressed ever onward, a tide of change pulling at the edges of belief.  Some clung to the old ways, to the shore, their eyes fixed on the familiar.  But the tide would not be denied. \n\nA hunger would rise, a yearning to find the wellspring, the pure water of the man's original message.  Decades, centuries, the river would carve its path, stripping away the layers, the stones added over time.  Until, at last, the bedrock remained – the man himself, and the echo of his voice.  And the Church, a weathered granite structure, would stand, its foundations deepened, its purpose redefined. \n\nFrom sea to shining sea, the change would come.  Diversity would give way to unity.  A single creed, a single song, a single vision.  History, a winding path, knew this turn.  It had seen the Roman Eagle fall, the whip of the past replaced by the cross.  It had seen the chains broken, the slave lifted to the seat of power.  And now, the river of faith would turn again, seeking the source, the beginning. \n\nThis would not be a rejection, but a return.  The words, once read as stone, would be seen as water, flowing, changing, ever-present.  And the story, the great story, would begin anew.  \n\nFar back, in the dust and heat, there was only Judaism.  A single light, a single truth, the whispered word of God.  And within that light, the seeds of the man's message were planted.  The Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Zealots – they were all branches of that same tree, reaching for the same sun.",
            "The Jungle, it lays bare the sin in man. A greed that gnaws deep, a hunger that knows no satiation. These folks, they claw and scramble, each for themselves, oblivious to the dust and the blood staining the ground beneath their feet. The factory owners, they are monuments to this hunger. Their eyes, they gleam with the cold fire of profit, their ears deaf to the cries of the workers, the pain of the land. Sinclair's words paint a picture of the smoke-choked sky, the river of industry blackening the horizon. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\"  They see only the bottom line, these men, deaf to the suffering their hunger inflicts. The workers, they are cogs, expendable, replaceable.  \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Hours stretch on, long and grueling, until the day comes when the axe falls, leaving them cast out, adrift in a sea of despair.  And these men, they fight, yes, they form unions, but even those become instruments of the same greed, sucking the lifeblood from the very people they claim to serve.  Sinclair speaks of them as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"  Packingtown, it is a crucible, a testament to the darkness that can fester in the heart of man.",
            "Some writers, they find their way. They try to make you feel things, know things. Some ways work, some don't. Fitzgerald, he was one of them. In his book, *The Great Gatsby,* he does it with words, the way he lays them together. Sometimes he'll spin a word, a noun, with an adjective, something that don't quite fit. He builds a feeling around it, a certain hum.  \n\nHe does it with colors too. Gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. He takes these colors, gives them weight, then throws them out there, like stones in a pond. White and gray, he uses them most. White, it holds a kind of shine, a touch of class. Gray, it's older, faded. He lays it on early in the book, white and gray everywhere you look. Daisy and Jordan, they're always in white. Nick, he wears white flannels to Gatsby's party. Tom, he's got a white shirt on when he meets Myrtle. Even Catherine, she's powdered milky white. Only time they ain't in white, it's when Nick's lookin' around Gatsby's party, and the colors are all wrong, all loud.\n\nFitzgerald, he paints the world in these colors, even the small things. Nick goes down white chasms in New York, names at the party are gray, Catherine's apartment, a slice of a white cake. Gray cars, gray land, a gray child, a gray old man. He uses these colors to show you what ain't important, what's just part of the machine.\n\nThen he starts using them for Daisy. After a while, he brings her back, dressed in white, in a white roadster. She starts to feel less like a person, more like an idea, something Gatsby wants.  A gray haze around her fur collar. White again, before the big showdown. He makes you see her, not just as a woman, but as a symbol, a ghost in white.",
            "The land lies heavy with sun, a thirsty bounty in San Diego County. Tomatoes ripen, citrus hangs fat on branches, and greens unfurl beneath a sky that knows no winter chill. The soil yields squash, broccoli, herbs, and the sweet flesh of peaches and lemons.  Berries stain the tongue, honey drips from combs, and peppers burn with fiery heat. A hunger for the pure, the untainted, drives a market for the organic, a waiting list longer than the branches of an ancient oak. \n\nEggs, rich and yellow, and milk, creamy and cool, flow from farms that hold themselves apart, vowing to the earth a pact of sustenance and respect. These places, they beckon the weary traveler, offering paths through fields, a chance to walk where birdsong hangs in the air, a glimpse of life unburdened by the harsh hand of industry.  And they whisper of opportunity, of a way to turn the till of the soil into a harvest of profit and purpose, to weave a tapestry of bounty that benefits both man and beast.\n\nFor the land remembers, it holds the whispers of generations past. The echoes of Native hands that tilled the soil before the rustle of cattle hooves and the clang of axes. The ghosts of homesteaders who sought their fortune beneath this sun-baked sky. The earth remembers, and it yearns for a balance, a harmony that favors the delicate dance of life. \n\nThis land, a patchwork of chaparral, grassland, and oak stands, sits nestled against the vast canvas of the Cleveland National Forest. It is a haven for creatures both common and rare, a sanctuary for the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, their wings beating a frantic rhythm against the silence.\n\nBut the path is not easy. The land demands respect, a tireless dedication to its well-being. To coax life from the earth without the crutch of chemicals, to nurture the soil, to shepherd the flocks, it is a labor of love, a constant negotiation with the forces of nature. \n\nAnd so, the choice stands before us: to exploit the land for fleeting gain or to nurture it for a future where both man and beast may thrive. To choose a path that honors the whispers of the past and paves a way for a future where the land sings with life.",
            "Culture. A ghost in the machine. A thing not named but felt. It ain't no single thing, no monolithic beast. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, is to miss the truth. It's the dark and light, the hum and the silence, that make up the song. \n\nA man walks into a room, a foreign room, and he sees it through the lens of his own world. Comparisons bloom like weeds. To understand another's way, you gotta dig deep. History, prejudice, the whispers in the shadows. You can't judge, can't change it. You gotta accept it, its boundaries, its ways. Especially when you're down on your luck, at the table with less than your share. \n\nRespect the old ways, the beliefs that bind a people. It's a bridge over troubled waters. \n\nCulture ain't just nation to nation. It lives inside companies too. Some preach long hours, others a slower pace. You see it in the clothes they wear, the way they speak, who they choose to work with. Some give to charity, others build walls around their giving.  Look at America, with its thousand faces. A million cultures in a single land. Some cultures, they wear their differences on their sleeve. Others, they hide them deep, waiting to be uncovered.\n\nValues. They're the heart of a culture. Why they do what they do. If face is important, a man won't shame his leader. If hard bargains are the rule, he won't give in easy. Before you sit at the table, learn the song they sing. But learn it from the heart. Know the man across from you. That's where the real deal lies.",
            "The fool, the scriptures say, hath spoken in his heart, “There is no God.” These words, found in Psalm 14, mark the opening of Anselm’s argument, a plea for the truth of a God known only through the scriptures, a God of the Bible. Aquinas, another voice in this desert of doubt, echoes this belief. And since both men stand on common ground, seeking to prove the same God, we’ll assume for this reckoning that both are right. To wander beyond the confines of their God, the God of the Bible, would be to stray from the path laid out before us. To compare apples and oranges, so to speak. \n\nBut let us be clear: neither man offers a complete understanding, a whole cloth tapestry of belief. Their arguments, while valid in their own way, remain threads, incomplete and frayed at the edges.\n\nAnselm, he speaks of faith, of finding God within the soul, a reflection of the divine in the human mind. He argues that to conceive of God’s nonexistence is to fall into a contradiction, a hole in the fabric of understanding. God, he claims, exists within the very act of knowing, a truth glimpsed in the depths of our own being. Foreign evidence, he seems to say, is a distraction, a whisper on the wind compared to the roar of the truth within.\n\nAquinas, however, offers a different path, a path paved with reason and empirical evidence. He argues for a God whose existence can be proven, not through faith, but through logic and observation. This, he suggests, would be a boon to the spread of the faith, a bridge for the unconvinced. For who could deny the logic of his five proofs: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony? Each, he argues, points to a necessary conclusion, a missing piece in the puzzle of the universe, a God whose existence is as undeniable as the night sky.",
            "The world spun on.  A fifth century sun beat down on a prince born in the shadow of what was to come.  Buddha, they’d call him, though then he was but a shadow himself, a child in a world of dust and clamor.  He walked a path that led him away from the world, outward into the silence. He found light there, a luminescence that bloomed in the emptiness. Teachings spilled from him, riverborn and vast, carving out a path for those who sought to follow. Buddhism, they called it, a name that echoed across centuries.  Theravada, the oldest branch, a gnarled tree reaching towards a sky forever changing.\n\nTwo and a half thousand years had passed.  Sri Lanka, a jewel island in a sea of change, still bore the marks of that ancient light. There, in the heart of the island, men and women gathered for the water-cutting. Monks and layfolk, bound by a shared history, their faces drawn and weathered like the ancient banyan trees. A ceremony silent as the grave, a ritual born not of Buddha’s own hand but of the slow, insistent tide of time.\n\nThe change, it was everywhere.  From the threads of tradition to the bone of belief, the world had reshaped the faith. The Theravada community, cloistered in saffron robes or woven in the fabric of everyday life, had shifted. The doctrines, like the sands of the shore, had been swept and sifted, molded by forces both gentle and harsh.  Some spoke of internal tides, of whispers from within the faith itself. Others of external storms, of winds that carried the scent of other gods, of other ways. \n\nThose winds, they came in shades of gray, some carrying the sting of hostility, others a quiet indifference.  There was no telling where a gust would land, what it might leave behind.  But the faith, it endured.  Like the lotus that blooms in the mud, it found strength in the shadows, its roots anchored in the four noble truths.\n\nDukkha, the first truth, the ache of existence.  Samudaya, the source of suffering, the clinging to what could not be held. Nirodha, the cessation of suffering, the letting go. Magga, the path to liberation, a narrow trail winding through the tangled forest of the mind.  These truths, they were the compass, the map, the anchor in a world of relentless change.",
            "The United States and Mexico. Two nations bound by a border, by history, by a feud that ran deep as the Rio Grande itself. Fifty-seven years it stretched, from the year of the Alamo to the cusp of the Great War.  A war born of hunger, of land and ambition, that saw Texas fall to the north and the sunbaked plains of the Southwest claimed as spoils. (Diehl & Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  But it wasn't just guns and blood that fueled the fire.  Religion, culture, tradition—these things too, like tinder in the wind, ignited the flames.  (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dance of shadow and fire, it ain't unique to these two.  Borders breed friction, nations bump and grind against each other.  Pletcher, he said it plain: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41).  Proximity breeds suspicion, and suspicion breeds war.\n\nReligion, a serpent in the garden of nations.  Frahm, she wrote of the American aversion to the cross, to the crown, in the shadow of the old world's wars. (Frahm, 2001, p. 86).  Like the Cold War, a battle not just of steel but of ideology, of ways of life.  Here, the lines were drawn in the dust, not by communism or capitalism, but by faith.  The ghosts of the conquistadors, of English and Spanish, lingered still, a poison in the well of diplomacy.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed, these two nations, over land and blood and bone. (Diehl & Goerts, 2000).   Bandits and outlaws, shadows on the border, bleeding the land dry.  It took the iron fist of both armies to finally quell the storm. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).  But as Mexico leaned on the United States, the fever broke.  American hunger shifted from land to the gold that flowed from its veins.  (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109, 110)",
            "Fifteen years gone now. It came on sudden, this sickness. A thing I'd never heard of. I was a nurse then.  A choice made out of a need, see? For the kind of safety I'd never known as a boy. \"Always work, they said. People always get sick.\n\nThat's what they drummed into you, as you grew up. So even though the dreams were wilder - science, maybe, or chasing stories - I tended to the sick.\n\nNow here I was, forty-six years gone, single, pockets as empty as a graveyard.  The sickness stayed with me, fifteen years of it, living on what the state calls charity. Nothing left to call my own. It's a struggle every day, a gnawing at the edges of your soul. Security, safety, self-respect - all gone to dust. Nothing certain anymore, except this: I wouldn't have lasted without the help. Family, a few good souls.  You learn what strong really means when the world cracks wide open.\n\nLife throws you curveballs, big and small. No guarantees. You can plan and prepare, but some things are too big to shoulder alone.\n\nThey say we gotta be self-reliant in this country.  But God knows, that government's rotten to its core. I'd rather see folks trust each other again - lend a hand, ask for help when you need it. Not everyone out there building their own bunkers.\n\nThey talk about the individual, the rugged spirit that built this land.  But what kept those folks going weren't grit alone, it was looking out for one another. Those pioneers who crossed the mountains, they didn't make it alone. It was the shared burden, the compassion, the scraps of kindness.\n\nSo, be ready. I am. I've got my supplies: water, first aid, candles, canned goods. A stash of batteries, a wood stove - if you've got the space.  But don't forget the neighbors.  That's the real preparation.",
            "The question hangs, a dark thing in the mind: why do creatures take the shape they do? Are there unseen chains, invisible binds that dictate the course of change? Even now,  a century past when Thompson spoke of the zoologist's dream, a dream yet unfulfilled, the question remains. Though mathematics has begun to pry at the edges of this mystery, dissecting the lives of mollusks, tracing the thread of their form through time, the vastness of the unknown remains.\n\nOur own work seeks to peer into this darkness, to illuminate the mechanisms that drive the dance of form and function. We have looked at the bones of Prunum, their ancient geometries, captured in x-ray's stark clarity. From these images, we have extracted parameters, building blocks of form, feeding them into the cold logic of CerioShell.  We have sculpted specters, imagined shells, pushing the boundaries of what might be.\n\nThe shell, a spiral etched in time, a tube winding its way through the void. Each turn, a whorl, a testament to the slow, inexorable march of growth. The columella, a ghostly axis, runs through the heart of the spiral, a silent thread connecting past and future. The whorls expand, their pace a whispered secret, separated by sutures, faint scars marking the passage of time.  The body whorl, the final testament, a monument to the creature's journey. The spire, a fading echo of its past, its tip, the apex, a point lost to the relentless flow of time. And from this silent chamber, the aperture, a gateway to the living world.\n\nWe study the shell from every angle, apical, basal, apertural, abapertural, each perspective a different facet of the same story. Their paths unfold in a silent symphony, a ballet of coordinates, a testament to the hidden language of growth. By understanding these movements, we seek to unravel the grand tapestry of evolution, to glimpse the forces that have shaped the world around us.",
            "The dead came easy in those parts.  Children, mostly.  Mothers too. For a decade the numbers held steady, a grim song against the bone.  While the country aimed for some kind of merciful goal, some water cleansed and clean, the children kept dying.  The mothers too.  Not enough was done.  Not enough, not nearly enough.  \n\nThey said the birth attendants were more numerous now, a bigger percentage, but what good was that if they couldn't mend a broken thing?  Midwives, they called them.  Women with hands like old leather, knowing the ways of birth but powerless against the storm that brewed within.  Hemorrhage, they called it.  The river turned against them.  \n\nDiarrhea, too, took its toll.  Children, wasted and thin, slipping away.  Mothers, too, the care they needed, a whisper in the wind.  Cesarean sections, a rare sight.  Four percent they said.  In the cities, seven.  Out in the fields, two.  A line drawn across the land, separating the world into haves and have-nots. \n\nThe poor, they struggled.  Their bodies broke beneath the weight of it all.  Twenty-seven percent, the gap between rich and poor.  A chasm, a gulf.  \n\nWhat then, was to be done?  Programs, they said.  Band-aids on a broken body.  Targeted, they said.  Fast.  But what of the other wounds?  What of the system itself, rusted and brittle?  \n\nThe money, it flowed to the loudest cries.  HIV, they said.  Family planning, left to wither.  Duplication, they called it.  Forms, paperwork, a mountain of it all.",
            "The Victorians, they liked their stories ornate, all lace and velvet, fixated on those who wore crowns and held silver. But there were whispers in the shadows, tales that strayed from the gilded path. *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, they ain't your mama's tea party reads.  A darkness bleeds through their pages, a touch of the uncanny, a strangeness that claws at the edges of propriety.  It's in these shadows that the characters find their truth, their motivations laid bare, their souls exposed.\n\n\"And now, a swarm of thoughts, dark and tangled, filled his mind. He walked between Sikes and Crackit, their voices a venomous hiss, their words like stones in his ears. He tried to pull himself free, but found he was speaking to them, caught in their web.  A sudden crack, a flash of fire, a scream ripped through the air. Lights danced before his eyes, a maelstrom of sound and chaos, and then he was gone, carried away by unseen hands.  Through the haze, a gnawing pain, a constant ache, a torment that wouldn't let him be.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese two tales, they play with the edges of reality, with dreams and visions that twist the familiar into something unsettling. *Oliver Twist*, it peels back Oliver's layers, revealing the scars beneath, the pain that gnaws at his heart. When the bullet finally finds its mark, in a chapter marked 28, it's not just a wound, it's a re-living of the nightmare, a dream where he's trapped in the echo of the shot. He's adrift, numbed, unable to fight, his senses dulled, a puppet in the hands of fate.  Was it Sikes? Crackit? Or was it something more, something that lurked in the shadows, something that had a hand in his suffering?  The question hangs heavy, a weight on his soul.  Oliver, he's broken, stripped bare by the world's cruelty, a hollow shell of a boy, his spirit crushed under the heel of despair.\n\n\n\"The day bled into night, a fleeting shadow, a stretch of emptiness.  Night, it crept like a shroud, long in its silence, short in its stolen hours.\"",
            "A couple years back I was workin' in one of them after school programs, tutorin' young'uns. Elementary school, mostly. Tried to lend a hand wherever it was needed, but my head was always in the books, knowin' my way around English and readin' like a cat in a yarn shop. One of the teachers, he asked me about this kid, Adrian. Third grade, maybe fourth, couldn't make heads or tails of readin'. Seemed like somethin' was off, the way he handled words. Some he'd stumble through, others he'd spit out clean. It was a puzzle. Latino kid, I figured, though he spoke English like a native. We fumbled along for a spell, until one day the boy's mama walked in. She didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish. I was barely learnin' the lingo myself, but we managed a kind of broken conversation. And then it hit me like a bolt from the blue. Adrian, he could read just fine. The problem wasn't readin', it was the alphabet. He didn't know the letters like the back of his hand. Don't know if that realization did him much good, but I hope he's doin' alright.\n\nI tell this story 'cause it's a reminder about the wall that language builds. Here in California, especially, you see it everywhere. It ain't always as plain as day, though. A kid speaks perfect English, but readin' it can be a mountain to climb.  Everybody knows the problem exists, so what's the answer? For Adrian, it was simple enough. Tutorin', pointin' out the letters, lettin' him hear 'em spoken. But for kids who barely speak a word, it's a whole different beast. Ain't no single solution. Dual language, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of it's a magic bullet. You gotta mix and match, find the right combination for each child.\n\nDual language programs, they're a good start, a damn good start. Not just for Spanish speakers, but for all the kids. Studies show they learn better, outperform their classmates. Some folks get scared, say it's a waste of time, money, that it won't help the majority. But that's a lie. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, every kid would benefit. Now, should we make every teacher bilingual? No. That's just plain crazy. But there's no reason we can't have folks, helpers, tutors, whatever you call 'em, who speak both languages.",
            "From the cradle we are told there's a vastness out there, a thing beyond reckoning. Some are sent to pews and synagogues, others to the silence of their own minds. Many take the faith laid upon them, inherited like a coat too big. But some, they cast it off, eyes fixed on the self, a universe contained.  Values shift like desert sands.  We wander, then, each a pilgrim in the wasteland of belief, searching for a spark in the dark, a beacon against the cold.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, the word hanging in the smoke of our cigarettes. We sat on the porch, rain drumming a slow rhythm on the tin roof, drowning the thirsty plants at the edge. He looked out at the storm, eyes half-lost, half-remembering.  He'd thinned, the clothes hanging loose on his frame. His hair, what was left of it, was thin as winter wheat. He avoided my gaze, staring into the rain-soaked night. I felt a cold knot in my gut, fear and a silence too vast to speak. To say the words would make it real, a truth we both feared. So I held him, drew close, and watched the rain fall with him, the twilight a shroud upon the world.\n\nHe died in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The treatments, they bought him time, but not peace. An echo of what God had wrought, I thought, to prolong the suffering. Alone in the dark, I offered no prayers. If there was a God, he'd ceased to hear me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to watch him leave, the life that birthed me slip away. I wouldn't be a witness to his death. I'd remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone, better than his own kin. He wouldn't want me there, a silent specter at his end. I curled in my bed, a shadow in a shadowed room, waiting for the news.\n\nBut the news never came.",
            "The Gothic, a word that tasted of dust and stone, was an oxymoron, Watt said, a marriage of the old and new.  Praised and damned, it wore the mantle of the sublime, a terrible beauty that sent shivers down the spine.  Walpole, the one who birthed this beast, in his *Castle of Otranto,*  stitched together the threads of ancient romances and the nascent form of the novel, a newfangled thing that peered into the heart of man. He borrowed the ghosts of the theatre, the shadows of medieval times, and draped them across the landscape of the modern. A Gothic Story, he called it, a tale spun from the remnants of a forgotten age.\n\nGothic, you see, was a word that clung to everything and nothing. It meant old worlds and new, a jumble of styles and eras, all seen through the lens of a time that judged it archaic, a relic of a bygone barbarity. Yet, it was in this very incongruity, this clash of the timeless and the transient, that the Gothic found its power. It offered a glimpse into the darkness within, a reflection of the fears that lurked beneath the veneer of progress.\n\nOne of its most potent weapons was chivalry, a chimera of valor and honor, a code of conduct that had once defined the knights of old. In Walpole's hands, it became a symbol of a lost innocence, a yearning for a time when men were men and virtue reigned.  Frederic, the prince in *Otranto,* was a tapestry woven from these threads. \n\nThe description of him, a prince bereaved, a knight-errant marked by tragedy, was steeped in the language of chivalry. He was the epitome of the gallant knight, larger than life, a shadow cast from a fading ideal.  This exaggeration, this hint of excess, would become a hallmark of the Gothic, a way of pushing the boundaries of reality and exploring the darker recesses of the human soul.  Walpole, a man wrestling with the turmoil of his own times, may have seen in chivalry a reflection of a lost world, a world he believed had been consumed by the encroaching darkness of modernity.",
            "The flow of things. From want to want. Raw bone to bone, through the factory's maw and out onto the waiting shelves. That's what they call it, supply chain management. A word coined in 1982 by a man named Oliver, a consultant of sorts. He saw the whole thing, the planning and pulling, the push and shove of it all, the aim to satisfy the hunger in the belly of the consumer, quick and clean. Six pieces to the puzzle, he said. Production, supply, the holding of goods, the placement, the carrying, and the knowledge. Six things a man has to hold in his hand to serve the customer.\n\nProduction, the heart of it. The fire and the forge. The knowing of what the people want, what gnaws at their insides. The market, that's where you look. The market tells the tale. Demand, they call it. Once you know the thirst, you know what must be made, how much must be forged. Where the work is done, that's the next question.  The right place, the right hands. You consider the needs, the wants, and the satisfaction. And then the schedule, the rhythm of the work, the keeping of the tools. Every detail a thread in the web. A broken thread, a wasted stitch, and the whole thing unravels. I've seen it. In the aisles of Wal-Mart, Target, the endless rows. Each step, a book, a pattern, a ritual. No room for error.\n\nSupply, the next piece. The gathering of what's needed. The making of choices, the choosing of partners, the deciding of what stays in-house and what goes out. A single product, many parts, many hands. You must align the pieces. Some things stay close, others go far. Outsourcing, they call it. To make things move faster, cheaper, to keep the costs low. To find the speed, the flexibility, the agility.",

A junta, born in the dust of a coup,  a decade's silence broken by the saffron robes of monks, their protests a flicker of flame against the encroaching night.\n\nThe Saffron Revolution they called it. A fleeting moment of hope. But hope, like a candle in the wind, is easily extinguished.  They came for the monks, these men of iron, their boots heavy on the worn stone steps of temples, their weapons spitting fire.  Journalists, witnesses to the truth, were swept away, silenced. One, a man named Nagai, fell beneath the jackboots, his camera a testament to the world's indifference.\n\nThirteen they said. Thirteen souls lost. But a voice whispered in the dark, a soldier turned defector, spoke of a different number, a thousandfold toll. The blood ran deep, staining the earth crimson.\n\nThis is the way of things. Power, a hunger that devours all in its path. From Rome's Caesars to the emperors of the rising sun, the urge to control, to bend the world to its will, has haunted mankind.

Two hundred, three hundred, or two thousand, three thousand?

            "Duke Ellington's shadow stretches long across the jazz landscape.  His time, his presence, shaped the sound of the orchestra, a band of voices given form. The piano itself, his own hand on the keys, is often muted, a whisper against the thrum of the music. But as a composer, he wove intricate tapestries, each thread a solo, each note a brushstroke on the canvas of sound. He built frameworks for flight, for improvisation, but also penned tight, interwoven passages, calling on the individual souls of his musicians to bring forth light and shadow, to reveal the heart of the music.  He shaped the tone, the texture, the very soul of the ensemble, coaxing from them a sound both coherent and wildly original.  This mastery, this understanding of the voices within the whole, allowed him to birth some of the most singular and breathtaking pieces that jazz has ever known.\n\nThe Grove's dusty pages speak of his sound, his innovation. They point to \"Creole Love Call,\" where the voice itself becomes an instrument, stripped bare of words, a raw and vibrant thread woven through the fabric.  In this early work, he shows a knack for complementing the players, a skill that defines his legacy. This slow, deliberate blues, a twelve-bar lament, unfolds in six distinct choruses:\n\n* Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reed, the voice flowing smooth at first, then hardening, turning rough at the edge.\n\n* Chorus 2: The muted trumpet, a whisper of brass, elaborates on the melody, stretching out the blues notes, savoring their ache.\n\n* Chorus 3: The clarinet soars, a high-pitched cry, backed by the piano's subtle, syncopated pulse.\n\n* Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, a dialogue between brass and reeds, a conversation in sound.\n\n* Chorus 5: The climax, a surge of sound. The reeds now take the call, their voices high and insistent, driven by the brass and rhythm sections, a syncopated stop-time heartbeat.\n\n* Chorus 6: A return to the first chorus, voice and reeds in conversation again. This time, the voice adopts the growl, a raw, primal sound, a soloing instrument.\n\nA brief tag, a vocal run, a dissonant trombone note, a jarring end.\n\nThe voice, a color in the music's palette, a texture woven into the sound, this is a thread that runs through his work, a hallmark of Ellington's artistry. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" a year later, he marries his tight orchestration with his ear for color.  \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing exchange a call and response. Miley's trumpet becomes vocal, Cox's voice an instrument, and together they create a rich and vibrant sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" takes this further, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She'd always felt a hunger in her, a wanting that gnawed at the edges of her soul. It started when she was fourteen, coming into that strange bloom of girlhood. Now, three years on, at seventeen, the hunger remained, though sharpened, focused. It wasn't for things anymore. No, it was for a person. Someone to fill the hollow. But boys, they meant nothing to her. Some had tried, clumsy and earnest, to court her, but none had stirred a flicker. She'd wrestle with the strangeness of it, searching for an answer in the dark corners of her mind. Theories had formed and withered, leaving her with a gnawing emptiness. So she lived, adrift in a sea of questions.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, a stillness like the dust motes dancing in a sunbeam. Her parents, good and simple folk, spoke in low tones, their lives a gentle rhythm. Arguments were rare, a storm cloud passing quickly over a calm sky. The only discord came from her own restless spirit, her yearning for independence a thorn in their contentment.  They were the quiet kind, she, a whirlwind of laughter and energy, a spark against their calm.\n\nBut this day, the stillness was broken. A sharp cry sliced through the house, her mother's voice, clear and panicked, echoing from the kitchen. She raced in, her heart hammering against her ribs. \"Mom? What is it?\"\n\nHer mother lay sprawled on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Ow,\" she gasped, each breath a ragged shard of sound. The girl knelt beside her, fear a cold knot in her stomach. \"Mom, what happened? Where does it hurt?\"\n\n\"Sweetie,\" her mother choked out, \"Need... hospital.\"\n\nThe words were squeezed from her, a desperate plea. Her daughter, her heart a drumbeat against her ribs, knew the gravity of the situation. \"Alright, Mom, I'm taking you. Where should I drive?\"\n\nHer mother pointed, her hand trembling, and the girl, her muscles burning with a sudden strength, lifted her mother, her own fear a distant echo. \n\nThe hospital, a place of sterile smells and hushed anxieties, blurred past in a rush of urgency. The girl, her face set in grim determination, carried her mother through the doors, her voice ringing out, \"Help! We need a doctor!\"\n\nThe girl watched, her heart a tight fist, as doctors swarmed around her mother, their faces grave. They whisked her away on a gurney, leaving the girl alone with her fear, the silence heavy with worry.\n\nLater, the doctor explained. A fall. A misplaced stepstool. A vase. An accident.",
            "The study aimed to sift the truth from the dust, to see if a way of eating, the so-called Mediterranean Diet, could hold back the tide of heart disease and stroke. They called it the aMed diet, a kind of reckoning with the old ways, more plants and beans, less of the flesh and fat. Fish, olive oil, and a measured pour of wine were allowed, but the sugar and the red meat, they were to be kept at bay.\n\nOld studies had seen whispers of this, a link between the Med diet and a longer life, a quieter heart. But this new study dug deeper, wanting to know about the silent killers, the strokes that took lives in the night.\n\nThey followed women, 74,886 of them, nurses bound by duty and a shared hunger for knowledge. For twenty years, they filled out their food journals, recounting the meals, the bites, the sips. The researchers, like vultures circling, scrutinized their words, hunting for patterns, for the telltale signs of a life well-lived, or ill-lived. \n\nThey looked for heart attacks, for strokes, for the cold hand of death. They accounted for every factor, every habit, every vice. Age, smoking, weight, the pills they swallowed, the sun they basked in. They stripped away the layers, seeking the truth beneath. \n\nAnd what did they find?  The women who ate like the ancient Greeks, they lived longer.  Their hearts beat steady, their strokes fewer. A higher score on the aMed scale, a closer walk with the olive oil and the beans, meant a lower risk of dying young, of falling victim to the darkness.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, a house of cards built on sand, began to tremble. Unemployment crept like a shadow across the land. Homes, once symbols of security, stood empty, their windows vacant eyes staring into the abyss. Corporations, giants of steel and glass, crumbled like dust. The sickness spread, a contagion of bad blood infecting the very soul of the nation. How did it come to this?  \n\nThe architects of this ruin, those who held the reins of power, had dealt in hubris and folly. They had pressed banks and men of commerce to peddle subprime loans, seeds of destruction sown in an already fragile soil. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those pillars of the financial order, were compelled to weave a tapestry of mortgages, threads of risk spun into CDOs and CDSs, a house of mirrors reflecting a distorted reality. When the music stopped, the borrowers defaulted. The banks, stripped bare, passed the contagion on, infecting the body politic.\n\nThe roots of this rot ran deep, back to the Clinton years, a time of prosperity that masked the simmering discontent. The President, seeking to extend his own reign, loosened the reins of regulation, a dangerous gamble that would have dire consequences. The whispers of warning went unheeded.  Steven Holmes, a chronicler of the times, saw the coming storm. He wrote of Fannie Mae's pressure to expand its reach, to lend to those who could not repay, and foretold the government's inevitable intervention.  His words, like prophets of doom, went unheeded.\n\nThe new instruments of finance, complex and arcane, only served to entangle the nation further. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs, these instruments of speculation, fueled the flames of the housing bubble. The nation, drunk on easy credit, overleveraged itself, teetering on the precipice.\n\nThe bubble burst, a deafening cataclysm that shook the foundations of the world. The financial institutions, those who had bet on the rise, were left holding the bag. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, titans brought low. Lehman Brothers, dismantled, a monument to hubris. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, forced to abandon their reckless ways, transformed into creatures of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, drowning in debt, were placed under the government's control.\n\nThe wounds of this crisis are still raw, a reminder of the fragility of prosperity, the seductive allure of risk, and the consequences of unchecked ambition.",
            "Exposition. A barren plain where the writer's words stretch thin, a whimper in the wind. Or worse, a raincloud, heavy with too much telling and too little showing, blotting out the sun of the story. Dr. Merlin, she's known to spit on the keyboard when she catches herself drowning in it. Not the kind of drowning that's fun, neither. \n\nYou know the rule. Show, don't tell. But even the best of us stumble, caught in the snare of too much information. The devil on your shoulder whispers, 'Get it over with,' urges you to lay bare the past, to spill the beans, to carve the history into every line. But that's not storytelling. That's a lecture.\n\nThink of it like this: a film, the characters trading barbs, spitting out facts like seeds from a cracked gourd. A dump of details, a torrent. In fiction, it's the writer doing the talking, the narrator filling in the blanks, laying down the foundation with words that stick like glue.\n\nTake this: a story, a heroine, a lover lost. They meet, they marry, he dies.  Two pages spent on a life's sum, the words flat as cardboard, the characters hollow.  Where's the depth? Where's the ache of loss?\n\nShow me the man, the husband. Let his words sing, let his eyes reflect the love he holds. Show me the woman, how his presence shaped her, how her world bloomed under his sun. Show me the bond, the fragile thread that binds them, and then show me the jagged break. \n\nOnly then can you make them real. Only then can you make me feel.\n\nAnd that, my friend, is the heart of storytelling.",
            "The television hummed, the light from the screen a sickly yellow in the dim room. Two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio, flickered across the screen. The first, NBC 4, live this morning, August the thirteenth, 2011. The lead story, a man, Shad Hostettler, a name like a bad wound, had stabbed his wife in Ashley.  They didn't name her. They showed his mug shot, an image of pure malice, and then moved on after two minutes. Multiple stabbings, they said, arrested. The details were thin, like smoke.\n\nThe next story, a younger man, Travis Buyers, eighteen years, shot in Sharon Woods, critically injured. No arrests, no suspects, only the echo of gunfire and the silent tread of the SWAT team. A quick glimpse, a fleeting shadow, as if the boy's fate mattered less.  It was the color of his skin, I thought, the shade of his neighborhood, that dimmed the light on this story.  Years I've watched this play out, a silent script of prejudice. A white child missing, a white man wronged, and the news would explode. A black boy shot, a black woman gone, and the sound is barely a whisper.\n\nThe helicopter, a Med-Flight, had been struck. A .22 caliber bullet, a whisper of violence against the sky. A five thousand dollar reward for information, a meager plea against the darkness.\n\nThe weatherman, a pale ghost against the green grass of a screen, spoke of thunderstorms and rain. The weekend, he said, mid-eighties. A tease, a promise of fleeting reprieve.\n\nA robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, they said, a hoodie pulled low, six feet tall, one hundred and fifty pounds.  They lingered on his blackness, as if it were the only detail worth knowing.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a drug kingpin from Texas, a name that tasted like dust and betrayal. He had conspired to bring marijuana into Ohio, they said, sentenced to three hundred months, a number that felt heavier, colder than twenty-five years. A Hispanic man, they noted, as if the color of his skin held some weight in the matter.",
            "The blood is thick. The tie that binds brothers, it cuts deep. It runs with love, yes, but with pride too. And jealousy.  And a cruelty that hides in the dark places.  Brothers see themselves in each other, clearer than any mirror.  The truth of that bond, it flares brightest in the firelight of hardship.   And it comes with a price. To understand the heart of brotherhood is to understand the weight of that price. To look into the eyes of your brother and see your own reflection, that's not the way the world sees you, no. That's the way you truly are. The deeds you do, the blood spilled, that's where the soul is laid bare.  \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk this path, across a landscape thick with green and shadow. Their journey, it's a fool's errand. The bitter sting of disappointment clashes with the iron grip of pride. Only one of them finds the strength to walk away. The story, it unfolds through the eyes of the boy who walks alone. The weight of his brother's burden, the weight of his own heart, it all spills out.\n\nPride, it's the engine that drives him. From their first clumsy steps together to their final, fateful climb, the boy is haunted by resentment. He yearned for a brother to teach, to share in the wildness of his own spirit. A brother to race with, to climb with, to share the secrets of the swamp. But Doodle, his brother, he was born frail, a bird with clipped wings. \n\nThe boy, he dreams of a different kind of brother. A brother who could keep pace, who could laugh in the face of danger. But Doodle, he's just a shadow, a fragile thing. The boy's dreams, they turn to dust. He even thinks, for a moment, of silencing Doodle forever.  But the boy, he hesitates. A small smile, a flicker of light in those fragile eyes, and the boy's heart, it softens.  The darkness recedes. But the seeds of pride, they remain.",
            "The human skull, a fortress of bone, houses a labyrinth of thought. A machine of flesh and fire, the mind has been likened to parchment, to ledger, to clockwork. Each metaphor a pale ghost of the reality within. The brain, a dark star, burns with its own light, a fire born of signal and echo.\n\nThe senses, tendrils reaching out, grasp the world. Touch, heat, sound, light - all transformed into whispers, into the language of the nerve. The brain, a tireless weaver, spins these whispers into meaning. Up from the raw material, bottom-up, the strands are bound, a picture taking shape. But the mind, a master of deception, knows more than the sum of its parts. Top-down, it reaches, guiding the strands, shaping the vision. A box, or a void? The brain decides.\n\nA gatekeeper stands, a vigilant censor. Attention, a flickering flame, illuminates the path, guiding the flow. A thousand blades of grass, a million whispers, drowned out. Yet a name, a whispered word, a beacon in the dark, cuts through the noise.\n\nMemory, a fractured mirror, holds the past. Sensory, fleeting; working, a brief flicker; long-term, a vast, silent archive. Information, encoded, stored, woven into the fabric of being. Some whisper of electrical currents, of looping signals. Others speak of proteins, of structures etched in the very essence of the mind.\n\nBut how is knowledge organized? A web, a map, a tangled forest? The mind, a closed book, its secrets yet to be revealed.",
            "The desert wind howled through the steel canyons of Huxley's Brave New World. A sun bleached landscape of conformity, its people were husks, programmed for pleasure and obedience. Their lives, a hymn to the machine, a testament to the siren song of capital. Aldous saw the coming darkness, the iron fist of technology encased in the gilded glove of progress. Community, they called it. A gilded cage where the individual withered, sacrificed on the altar of instant gratification.\n\nHe saw the World Controllers, their eyes cold and calculating, weaving the fabric of this dystopia.  Marx's ghost whispered in his ear, a specter of alienation and reification.  Homogeneity, the enemy of the soul, spread like a plague.  Huxley, the prophet, saw the proletariat, not in the factories of his time, but in the shallow eyes of the Deltas and Gammas.  Their desires, manufactured, their dreams, hollow echoes of a forgotten humanity.\n\nFalse consciousness, the Marxist specter, gripped them tight.  They were blind to the true relations of their world, their appetites stoked by the flickering screens of the World State.  Consume, they whispered.  Obey.  Be content.  The Alpha, the Beta, they knew better.  But their knowledge was a cold fire, a useless ember in the face of the machine.  They too were trapped, complicit in the system's slow, creeping decay.\n\nLove, a forgotten word, a relic of a time before.  Theirs was a world of shallow glances, of fleeting desires, of bodies fleetingly touched.  The human soul, starved of connection, withered in the sterile air.  The social order, a pyramid of oppression, stood firm.  \n\nHuxley's Brave New World was a warning, a stark reflection of a future not yet written.  A future where the machine devoured the soul and the individual, leaving only a hollow shell in its wake.",
            "The sun wore low in the sky above the sprawl of University Park. Two and a half years. That's how long I'd walked these cracked pavements, these endless quadrants of brick and mortar.  Four and a half semesters.  East Halls. They called it a dorm, but it might as well have been a outpost on the edge of some forgotten frontier. The wind whipped off the fields, carrying the ghost of autumn and the echo of distant football cheers.  My freshman year, that's where they sent me. A stone's throw from the stadium, a world away from Willard, that nexus of commerce and knowledge.  Twenty minutes, maybe more, to traverse the distance on foot.  The weather, a fickle mistress, often laid waste to the journey. Rain, snow, sleet. They all conspired to turn the asphalt into a slick, treacherous ribbon.  An old boy, not much older than myself, told me tales of a time when East Halls stood alone, surrounded by acres of vacant land. Now, that wasteland was a testament to progress. Fields of green, concrete leviathans like the Creamery and the new health center, and apartment blocks reaching for the sky. The campus, a beast in perpetual motion, was consuming itself, growing ever more sprawling, ever more disjointed. How to navigate this labyrinth?\n\nA friend, a fellow traveler on two wheels, had returned to the bike after a long absence. \"Why did I ever stop?\" he'd mused. \"Bikes are the answer,\" he'd said, his voice rough with conviction. \"It's the only way.\"  More than just a means of transport, the bicycle was a philosophy. A rebellion against the tyranny of cars and buses.  A commitment to efficiency, to freedom. A bowl of oatmeal and a few pedal strokes, and the miles would melt away.  \n\nI, too, had made the change.  Living off-campus now, just as distant from the heart of the university as some of those dorms, I'd bought a bike.  It was the smartest decision I'd made. My classes were in Thomas building, a quarter-hour walk at the very least. But on two wheels, it became a mere five minutes, a blur of motion.  Pollock Road, the artery connecting me to the university, was a hard road to travel. Not for the faint of heart.  Walking, I knew, was a virtue, but time, a commodity more precious than gold, was a luxury I couldn't afford.  Without the bike, I'd be tethered to the sidewalks,  another cog in the slow, grinding machine of the university.  Two and a half hours a week. That's what walking to Thomas building would cost me.  And that was just one class. Multiply that by all the others, all the appointments, all the errands, and the hours would bleed away, swallowed by the insatiable maw of time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The road of service draws me. To the Division of Family and Children Services, to walk with those lost and broken. To mend the tattered seams of families frayed by neglect and violence. Service. Respect. Ethics. These are the stones upon which the house of social work is built.  Not just for the work, but for the man I wish to be.  Always, there was a pull towards helping. But the path remained shrouded. I saw too many souls fleeing their shadows, others seeking solace in hollow bargains. Witnessing these things, I turned to psychology. A degree earned, but the path still unclear. A summer stretched before me, a time for reckoning. A friend, a couch, a boy of sixteen, eyes wide with fear. He spoke of parents, of shadows in the home. The next day, the boy called for help, a bridge thrown across the chasm of his despair. I drove to the house, a tremor in my hands. I spoke to the officers, shared what I knew, the weight of my recent studies pressing upon me. But the law, it held its hands. They needed a different kind of truth. I spoke to the parents, their eyes flickering like dying embers. Evasive words, excuses wrapped in the cloak of blame. A child’s pain, dismissed as manipulation. That day, the path hardened, etched in the dust of their denial. \n\nJustice. A word whispered in the wind, but seldom heard. A society that claims to value the individual, yet herds us all into the same pen.  We mourn those lost, but celebrate sameness. I wear my difference like a shield, a testament to the fierce spirit that burns within. High school, college, a canvas for my dissent. Colors clashed, piercings broke the mold, words spoken against the tide of conformity. I stand with the marginalized, against the march of injustice. The fight is woven into the fabric of my being. This is the work I choose, to mend the broken, to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.",
            "The paper lays out the terrain of the sleeplessness. It probes the biological and the sociocultural. The biological, it delves into the genes we inherit, the flesh and bone of the body's workings. The sociocultural, it examines the world outside, the pull of place, the weight of circumstance, the shadows cast by race and class and the common fate we share.  This review, it seeks to map these territories, to trace the threads of research that bind them. It will dissect the findings, expose their strengths and frailties for all to see.\n\nSleep itself, a restless thing, can be a prisoner in its own right. Sometimes it's a primary affliction, a broken thing from the start. Sometimes it's a symptom, a hostage to the mind's own torment.  Sometimes it's a casualty, a victim of the body's ills or the poisons we take.  The Dyssomnias, they are the sleep disorders, the core of the problem. Insomnia, the scourge of wakefulness. Hypersomnia, the endless embrace of slumber. Narcolepsy, a thief of consciousness. Breathing disorders, the rasping breath of death at night. Circadian Rhythms, the body's clock gone astray. And then there are the Parasomnias, the nightmares, the terrors that stalk the sleep-ridden soul.\n\nBut this review, it focuses its lens on insomnia, a specter that haunts us all. And in its darkness, it seeks to understand the biological and sociocultural forces at play.\n\nThe biological model, it points to the genes and the brain. To the neurons in the hypothalamus, the tiny architects of sleep and wakefulness. The orexin neurons, they whisper secrets of slumber. This study, it delves into the world of mice, tiny reflections of ourselves.  They found that these orexin neurons, they bear the GABAB receptors, keys that unlock the gates of sleep. Activate these receptors, and sleep descends. Inhibit them, and the mind races, consumed by anxiety. The agonist baclofen, it pushes the body towards slumber.\n\nThis knowledge, it hints at a truth: our genes, our very flesh, can shape our sleep. A flaw in this receptor, a broken key, and the night becomes a battlefield. The implications, they ripple outward, touching every aspect of life. School, work, the mundane tasks of every day, all become a struggle in the grip of insomnia. And the sociocultural landscape, it too plays a role. If this genetic predisposition is inherited, passed down through generations, then the world around us, the pressures and burdens we bear, can amplify its effects.",

            "Twelfth Night, it speaks of a darkness in the heart of man. A hunger for disguise, for the shedding of skin. A soul cloaked in borrowed flesh, walking a tightrope above the abyss.  The play whispers that such a dance can be a dance with the devil. For how long can a man live a lie before the lie becomes him? And what of the wreckage left behind?\n\nTo cast off the mask, to reveal the face beneath, is to risk the storm. Some will turn away, eyes glazed with hurt, hearts hardened by betrayal.  To speak the truth, to stand naked in the sunlight, is to choose solitude over the comfort of illusion.\n\nThis is especially true when the disguise is one of gender. Why, the play asks, would a soul seek to bury its true form beneath the shroud of another?  In Viola's case, it was necessity.  A shipwreck, a perilous journey, and a world that offered no solace to a woman alone.  \n\n\"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\" she says, \"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" Her words hang in the air, a testament to the fragility of her existence.\n\nBut the mask, it takes hold. It becomes a fortress, shielding her from harm, but also cutting her off from the solace of her own kind.  And in this twisted labyrinth of deception, she finds herself entangled with the nobleman Orsino, his heart drawn to the phantom she has become.\n\n\"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times,\" he sighs, \"Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nThe play dances with ambiguity.

Is this a reflection of the times, a mockery of societal constraints?  \n\nThe answer, perhaps, lies in the shadows.  \"A sister, you are she,\" Olivia declares at the end. The mask has fallen, the truth revealed. But the question remains: what price has been paid for this unveiling?",
            "The German hand, it left a mark on the land. A harsh one. The whispers speak of the Nama and the Ovaherero, wiped clean. A stain on the empire's ledger, a testament to the cruelty it could wield. But empires are not singular things. They breathe a multitude of airs, wear many masks. The German reach, it stretched far and wide, its policies as varied as the dust and the sun that beat upon its colonies. Education, that seed of knowledge, found fertile ground in some places, a barren waste in others. The Brits, when they took hold of East Africa, they found a people already touched by learning, their minds aflame with the torch of literacy. In Kamerun and beyond, the Germans, they too, spoke of progress, of the educating hand.\n\nBut South West Africa, that land of harsh beauty, it held a different tale. No state-sanctioned schools there, no grand structures of learning. The burden of education, it fell upon the shoulders of the missionaries, their meager efforts funded by a government that turned its gaze elsewhere. The white man, he was the recipient of a different kind of care. The Germans, they built schools for their own, nurtured their minds, their tongues, their souls. A double standard, etched in stone and dust.\n\nThe echoes of this divide, they linger still. While other lands boasted a tapestry of literate minds, South West Africa remained cloaked in darkness. The majority, they remained untouched, uneducated, their voices lost in the wind. The reasons, they are many, woven into the fabric of history. This paper, it seeks to unravel those threads, to shed light on the hearts and minds of the settlers, the colonial masters, and the natives they sought to control. \n\nThe past, it whispers, and we must listen.  Little has been written about the German empire, but what exists, it speaks volumes. The early accounts, they are like ghosts, their voices faint, their words written in a language that once held sway. They describe the systems, the methods, the failures. Later voices, they emerged from the shadows, comparing, contrasting, dissecting. They tell a story of disparity, of two colonies on a single continent, their fates entwined yet forever separate. Cohen, his name rings out, his work a beacon in the darkness. He saw the truth, the stark reality of South West Africa, a colony where education was a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe land itself, it offered a different kind of solace. Not a paradise, no. But a land of moderate temper, a respite from the scorching sun that blistered other lands.  Whites, they flocked to its shores, drawn by the promise of a new life. By 1913, they were fifteen thousand strong, a small army of settlers, a testament to the allure of the unknown.",
            "The music they call popular, it’s swelled like a river over a century, branching into a thousand tributaries.  Names for these branches, names for the music, they’re hard to catch, they slip through your fingers like water.  Rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – all of them, names just to make sense of the flood. And each one, they’ve spun their own webs of sub-streams, sub-sub-streams, a tangled delta of sound.\n\nHeavy metal, that’s one branch that’s grown thick and wild.  Forty years, maybe more, it’s been churning, churning up the darkness, churning out emotion raw and unfiltered. It’s not pretty, not always. It’s the kind of music that claws at you, that bleeds from the cracks in the world.\n\nThey’ve carved out niches in it, more than you can count.  A thousand shades of black, a thousand ways to scream.  What is metal then? Where does one branch end and another begin? It’s a question that hangs in the air, heavy as the guitar riffs.\n\nIt’s a movement, not just a genre. Metal is born of darkness, of the things we keep buried deep. More bass, more volume, more dissonance. It’s the music of excess, the music of the primal scream.  Skill, too, there’s a kind of mastery in the way they wield their instruments. They know how to play, and they play hard.\n\nAnd it’s fueled by something else, something dark and ancient. Drugs, they whisper, they were the fuel for the fire.  A fever dream in the seventies, a haze of possibility and despair. They say it’s in the music, the echoes of a lost world, the screams of a generation.\n\nBut it’s more than just drugs. Metal’s roots run deep, back to the Romantics, to the poets who sang of the night and the shadows. It’s a reflection of the darkness we all carry inside, the things we try to hide.\n\nTake the Beatles, even they dipped their toes in the dark. “Helter Skelter,” they called it, a song that spins like a runaway train, a descent into chaos.  Maybe it was the drugs, maybe it was something else, but it was a crack in their polished image, a glimpse of the darkness that lurks beneath.",

But the world, it was a harsh mistress, demanding conformity, mimicking the styles of the day. \n\nRousseau, born in Laval, France, a son of a tinsmith, his life was a canvas of hardship. No schooling in the arts, just the drudgery of toll booths and the sting of loss. His wife, Clémence, gone, eight children lost, only Julia remained. Painting became his refuge, his solace. But the art world, it was a cold place. He toiled away, while Matisse and the others climbed the ladder of fame. \n\nJan Gordon, he wrote about them, two painters on different paths.

Art and morals, they ain't sumthin' to be wholly captured, like a fly in amber. O'Connor, she knew this well: \"A story is a way to say somethin' that can't be said any other way.\" No matter how we dissect it, there's somethin' left unsaid, somethin' that hangs in the air. Ethics, it's the same. Wittgenstein, he said it plain: \"Ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nMorality and art, they touch us in a way that's beyond words, a noumenal thing. They seep into the soul, leaving a mark that can't be erased. Literature, it's a double shot of this truth. McKean, he called it \"the moral quality\" that sets it apart.  We live by values, and literature holds them up to the light, letting us see them clear.",
            "The sun bleeds over the Alps, staining the snow-capped peaks a bruised purple.  Down in München, the air is thick with the murmur of a thousand tongues, each a thread spun into the tapestry of German culture.  It stretches east, a ribbon of language and custom, winding its way past the Rhineland, past Köln, where the great river sighs, past Dresden, where the Elbe whispers tales of a long-gone Saxony.  This land, forged in the fires of a thousand winters, is a crucible where tribes have clashed and mingled, their stories woven into the very fabric of the earth.\n\nGermania.  The name itself hangs heavy, a ghost from a forgotten time. Scholars, like moths drawn to a flickering flame, have scratched and clawed at its origins, seeking to unravel the secrets it holds. Tacitus, that old Roman scribe, claimed it came from the Tungrians, a tribe that crossed the Rhine, their steel singing in the clash against the Gauls. Caesar, the conqueror, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his chronicles of war, a word snatched from the Gauls themselves, a tool to divide the conquered from the unconquered. Some whisper it came from a spear, the \"ger\", a weapon of wood and iron, others from the guttural cries of battle, a roar that echoed across the plains.\n\nThe old Roman, Tacitus, in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", painted a picture of a people untouched by the tides of migration, a race abiding in their ancient home.  \"I should regard them,\" he wrote, \"as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\"  He saw a land unforgiving, a land of wild winds and sullen skies, a land where only the most hardy would dare to dwell.\n\nBut Rome, ever hungry for conquest, sent its legions to the borders of Germania, their legions hungry for gold and glory. They traded, they fought, but they never truly settled.  The Germanic tribes, fierce and proud, held their ground, their axes ringing against the Roman shields. They traded the bounty of their forests, their furs and their skills, and some even joined the ranks of the Roman legions, their loyalty bought and paid for.",
            "The view unfurled below, a dark and silent thing. I looked, my mind a vacant space. No thoughts took root, no judgments formed. Just the raw image, laid bare. Like water flowing, the impressions came and went, leaving no trace. \n\nAn old book lay open on my palm. \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" An artist's counsel, a promise of skill.  To see, to understand the lines, the shapes.  The world as a flat plane, a bowl of fruit suspended on nothingness. I'd tried that once, with a bowl of fruit, a kitchen, a room beyond. But the sight had swallowed me whole. A blue man, a green world, a rainbow of flesh.  If mine was to be a story, this was its canvas, its first brushstroke. Brown.\n\nThe tool felt heavy in my hand. Muscle memory took over, a practiced dance. But the water, it flowed and swirled, clear as a winter sky. And a speck, a fleck, a piece of myself, breaking free.  Then a spasm, a jolt, a desperate push. The porcelain held fast. Soiled and silent, a message left for the unseen.\n\nMop in hand, tie tight, I faced the aftermath. A curtsey to the mundane, a ritual of the uncelebrated. Flush, flush, the water churning. The world shrinks, then expands. A sheet, a glove, a pale shield. Slowly, deliberately, I dipped in. A mother's touch, a deathly embrace.",
            "Teenagers die behind the wheel. A confluence of factors pull them down, a dark vector in the statistics of young Americans. The Institutes, they say, the brain ain't built for it, not yet. Not ready for the road's cruel geometries. \n\nInEXPERIENCE, they call it.  And it's the heart of the matter. \nMore than just crashes, more than the mangled metal and broken glass.  It's the young ones who roll over, who push too hard, who drift off the asphalt's edge.  \n\nThey ride with their kind, these young ones.  Always with each other, like moths drawn to a flickering light.  The Californians, they studied it.  Age of the passenger, the accidents, a grim correlation etched in the data.\n\nThey've tried, these states, to build some kind of cage around them.  Provisional licenses, they call them, with hours and restrictions and limits. But a cage is just a cage.\n\nThe real problem, it cuts deeper.  They're not ready.  Not by the numbers, not by the measure of their own making.  Zuckerman, the psychologist, he says eighteen's too young.  Too young for the weight of the wheel, the responsibility of steel and rubber on asphalt.  They crave the rush, the sting of danger, a thrill that feels like living.  They're hungry for it, these young ones.\n\nAnd so they die.\n\nWe can't keep letting them die.  Laws, they say.  Schools, they say.  Education, they say. But the answer is simpler, starker.  \n\nWait.  Wait until the hunger fades, until the need for the rush subsides.  Wait until the numbers change, until the roads are safe again.\n\nWe owe them that much.  The dead, they owe us nothing.",
            "The Library of Congress, a repository of dust and echoes, held a trove of Edison’s earliest visions. Fifteen trick films, flickering ghosts from 1895 to 1901. Illusions spun from the raw threads of editing. My study, a sifting through these phantoms, sought to map the poetics of their artifice, to find the outliers, the whispers of something more. The trick film, a creature of its time, was bound to the stage. A frontal proscenium, a fixed gaze. No camera to wander, to chase. Long shots, medium shots, the actors confined to a horizontal dance, their fate sealed within the frame. One shot, one film. A rigid decree. \n\nBut even in this cage, there were tremors. A few, at the dawn of the century, dared to breach the walls. Multiple shots, a glimpse of something beyond the bounds. \n\nThe proscenium, a stage within a stage, was their prison and their stage. The camera, a silent sentinel, never shifted its gaze.  Bound by the theatre, by vaudeville’s shadow, by the conjuror’s art. Movement was a sideways sway, a waltz across the stage’s edge. Take “Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,” a film from 1900. The actors, trapped in their spectral dance, move left and right, vanishing and reappearing, but never venturing towards or from the camera’s cold eye. \n\nLong shots, the vast majority. Medium shots, a fleeting respite. Close-ups, the intimacy of the human face, absent. The audience, like the stage, witnessed everything, framed by the immutable borders.\n\nOne conceptual shot, one film. A minute or less, a fleeting glimpse of a world built on illusion. A vaudeville trick, a disappearance, a sleight of hand. A story, if there was one, was thin, a wisp of smoke. \n\nYet, in the eye of the beholder, a single shot could be a tapestry.  A joining of fragments, a conjuring of the impossible. Look closer, at “The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,” a film from 1895. The severed head, a phantom limb, a moment of physical reality in a world of artifice. One shot, the camera never blinks, but the illusion is built on pieces, on the careful joining of fragments.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the soil, was a firebrand for Republicanism, his voice ringing out for freedom and the land. Though a farmer by trade, his calloused hands held the weight of a life steeped in politics, a life etched by the struggle against tyranny. His faith, absolute, rested in the agrarian way, a way of life he saw as the cornerstone of true liberty.  It was this conviction, this reverence for the tiller, that colored his pronouncements on sovereignty, on the Constitution's sacred parchment, even on the men who sat in judgment.\n\nHe saw in the newly formed nation a chance, a clean slate, unburdened by the ghosts of old world systems.  With no inherited lineage to bind them, the architects of this government could build anew, a republic of self-reliance, a testament to the inherent rights of man.  These rights, he believed, were woven into the very fabric of existence, each one indivisible, each one a thread in the tapestry of freedom. To deny one was to unravel them all, leaving the remaining threads tattered and weak.\n\nThe state, he argued, was a necessary evil, a bulwark against the darkness within man, the primal struggle between good and evil that raged within every soul.  He saw in the human heart both the capacity for great good and the potential for monstrous deeds.  \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.\"  His vision of a righteous government rested on principles that protected property, nurtured the land, and tempered the excesses of capital. A government, he believed, built on such principles would endure, its administration fleeting, a mere shadow cast by the eternal light of justice.\n\nTaylor, like many of his brethren, called for a strict reading of the Constitution, a razor's edge against the encroaching tide of federal power. He saw in a bloated government the seeds of tyranny, a leviathan fueled by avarice and consumed by its own appetites. Yet, he cautioned against a blind adherence to the letter of the law, for without understanding the intent of the framers, the words could become a weapon, twisted and corrupted.  He looked to the Declaration of Independence, the true testament of the nation's birth, as a guiding light, a beacon reminding them that the states were sovereign, not pawns in a centralized game.",
            "The numbers dipped in the third month, a sharp fall like stones from a high ledge. Figure 17 shows it plain. Why? The wind turned cold, winter coming on, a New England bite. Bikes and feet, they stay in the shed. December. The semester's end, a scramble for grades, for knowledge and completion. A log gets misplaced in the rush.  And then the holidays, a long dark peace settling over the campus. Students gone, faculty too, no need for paths to tread. Come January, classes start up again, a trickle of logs. But February, that's a mystery.\n\nPerhaps the fire of new things burns bright, then fades. A natural thing. To counter that, we built a fire anew, a week of challenges, a blitz of carpooling.  The logs climbed, a flicker of hope in March.  But the heart of the matter, the challenge, was to keep the flame burning. Winter's chill, the breaks in the year, they all pull at the soul, make it hard to keep going.\n\nAnother thing, people like their cars. It's the way they move, free as the wind. A deep thing, woven into the fabric of this land.  So we offered gifts, tokens of appreciation:  coffee, meals, a rub of the back, books, even the trinkets of the chain stores.  Maybe something bigger would have worked, a bicycle, a car that breathed clean air, a promise of the open road. Would it have kept the logs full? Would it have caught the fire again?\n\nThe gifts stayed the same, a steady thing. But what if they grew, a slow crescendo? A bicycle here, a car there, announced in the cold months.  A promise of something more, a beacon in the darkness.",
            "The thing they call an ETF, an Exchange Traded Fund, is a kind of paper promise. It's built to follow the moves of a market index, or maybe a single commodity, or a basket of things like some kind of index fund. But it's quicker, slicker. Trades like a stock, on the board, with all the flash and the risk.  \n\nYou get the spread of the index, the supposed safety in numbers, but with the bite of a single stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, even own just a sliver, a single share, if that's all you got.\n\nThey say it's cheaper, these ETFs, the fees lower than the mutual fund kind. But there's a price, always a price. Every trade, a commission, like a toll to pass through the gates. \n\nAnd the choices, they've got a whole damn army of these ETFs, each one promising something different. But a smart man, a man who knows the way the world turns, he knows to ask: do these promises hold water? Does the spread truly exist, or is it just another illusion?\n\nWe're lookin' at one, IHF they call it.  We're gonna cut through the noise, focus on the top ten.  They hold most of the weight, 63.58% of the whole damn thing.\n\nTo see if these ten hold the same promise as the whole ETF, we gotta look at their fingerprints. We'll measure their Beta, their risk, and their Return, see if they paint the same picture as the whole shebang.\n\nWe'll lay it all out: the numbers, the percentages, the risks and the rewards.  Because in this game, the truth ain't always what it seems.",
            "Dream-Land. One of Poe's own pronouncements, a better poem. But the word Thule, it hangs there, twice in the piece, a ghost from Virgil's pen. Mabbott, he says it's Virgil, an island north of Britain, the edge of what men knew. And Virgil did use it, yes. But there's a shadow, a closer echo. Poe, he hungered for the German tongue.  \n\nArndt, he saw the kinship, in Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon. A borrowed melody, a likeness in the dark. The Oxford Companion, it speaks of Goethe, the man who spun the tapestry of Faust, a tale in two parts, first in '08, the second on the day he breathed his last, '32. Within that second part, a poem, The King of Thule. A king, his queen gone, a goblet offered, a poisoned gift. He drinks, he weeps, a hollow man, and in the end, he walks to the edge, the goblet flung to the sea, eyes closed, and the darkness claims him. \n\nTwo shades, the King of Thule and the man in Dream-Land, a mirror held to Poe's own sorrow, the whisky a solace. Faust, it was brought to the stage by Grattan, just a year before Poe's own Thule in The Pit and the Pendulum. \n\nTwice does Poe speak of Thule, once in the darkness of The Pit, and twice in Dream-Land, bookends to his dream. Companion pieces, they are. The speaker in Dream-Land, he walks through the landscape of Thule, a world drained of color, a haunted place. The King of Thule, he too is haunted, his loss a wound that bleeds.\n\nGoethe, a giant in Poe's world, a presence felt even through the respect Poe held for Tennyson.  The world teemed with Goethe's words, echoes in the wake of his own.",
            "The law in this California dust bowl says a man hurt by a slick of applesauce on the floor of a market might be owed more than just his medicine. He might be owed a reckoning. The question is, would the law see malice in the manager's eyes, a cold disregard for the man's well-being?\n\nJennifer Palmer, that's the woman who took a tumble.  She says the manager, Martin, knew about the spill. Knew it twice. Told by two different souls, one named Wayne, the other Haddigan. But Martin, he was on his own supper, and said he had no time for the cries of customers. Half an hour passed. The spill remained. Then Palmer came along. She fell hard, her back a cracked thing now.\n\nThe law speaks of malice. It speaks of a willfulness, a knowing disregard. And it speaks of a conduct so base, so foul, it's barely human. Could the manager be said to have done this with malice aforethought?\n\nThe six slips and falls that had happened that year at this same store, the same aisle, their story hangs in the air like the smell of rot.  Did Martin see those past falls and turn away? Did he see the danger and choose to ignore it, to profit off the chance of another's pain?\n\nWe're looking at the law here, the cold law. We're looking for the lines, the boundaries of what can be called malice. Did this manager act with a heart of stone? That's the question that hangs over this case, heavy as a storm cloud in the valley.",
            "Four years gone now, a course in Islam at CBC.  A fire in the classroom, the question burning: was it a faith of hostility? Now more than ever, the question hangs heavy.  Seen it shift, the media's view. From the shadow of the towers, a hatred, a fear.  Then a turning, a tide of tolerance, a turning so swift it scarcely seems possible. Now, a man named Obama, a name like a whispered prayer, a man of faith, stands in the light of the highest office. Could that have been in 2001?\n\nThe Prophet's story, it's a riddle.  What I knew, what I thought I knew, was a man of conquest, a sword raised. Tribes subdued, forced to bend the knee, to swallow the faith.  But this biography, it paints a different picture.  A man humbled, misunderstood, a martyr.  Truth, it whispers, not force.  People drawn to him, seeking the light.\n\nThe echoes, they are there. Jesus and Muhammad. The loaves and fishes, a mirror held to the desert.  Forty men fed, a hand raised, a miracle.  It's a way of telling the story, a way of making him seem less, a man of quiet faith, of truth lived, not proven.  But the truth, it cuts like a knife. It doesn't discount the miracle, the life, the man who walked on water. It's a shadow cast, a theft, a reaching for the light of another.\n\nAnd the witnesses, the stories told and retold, a game of telephone.  He said, she said, whispers in the wind.  A third party, a shroud over the truth, a cloud of doubt.  It's supposed to prove, to solidify, but it does the opposite.  It unravels, it weakens.\n\nThe thing that sits heaviest is the way they try to build him up, Muhammad, a saint, a gentle soul.  History, it whispers a different tale.  A man of power, a man of ambition.  Do they, the faithful, know the truth?  Do they know the man beneath the legend?",
            "The man’s words, the words of the Nazarene, they drifted away like dust on a wind.  The Church, like a river swollen and twisting, bore him onward, past the quiet pools where his words had first been spoken.  A strange turning, this.  The world now pressed ever onward, a tide of change pulling at the edges of belief.  Some clung to the old ways, to the shore, their eyes fixed on the familiar.  But the tide would not be denied. \n\nA hunger would rise, a yearning to find the wellspring, the pure water of the man's original message.  Decades, centuries, the river would carve its path, stripping away the layers, the stones added over time.  Until, at last, the bedrock remained – the man himself, and the echo of his voice.  And the Church, a weathered granite structure, would stand, its foundations deepened, its purpose redefined. \n\nFrom sea to shining sea, the change would come.  Diversity would give way to unity.  A single creed, a single song, a single vision.  History, a winding path, knew this turn.  It had seen the Roman Eagle fall, the whip of the past replaced by the cross.  It had seen the chains broken, the slave lifted to the seat of power.  And now, the river of faith would turn again, seeking the source, the beginning. \n\nThis would not be a rejection, but a return.  The words, once read as stone, would be seen as water, flowing, changing, ever-present.  And the story, the great story, would begin anew.  \n\nFar back, in the dust and heat, there was only Judaism.  A single light, a single truth, the whispered word of God.  And within that light, the seeds of the man's message were planted.  The Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Zealots – they were all branches of that same tree, reaching for the same sun.",
            "The Jungle, it lays bare the sin in man. A greed that gnaws deep, a hunger that knows no satiation. These folks, they claw and scramble, each for themselves, oblivious to the dust and the blood staining the ground beneath their feet. The factory owners, they are monuments to this hunger. Their eyes, they gleam with the cold fire of profit, their ears deaf to the cries of the workers, the pain of the land. Sinclair's words paint a picture of the smoke-choked sky, the river of industry blackening the horizon. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\"  They see only the bottom line, these men, deaf to the suffering their hunger inflicts. The workers, they are cogs, expendable, replaceable.  \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Hours stretch on, long and grueling, until the day comes when the axe falls, leaving them cast out, adrift in a sea of despair.  And these men, they fight, yes, they form unions, but even those become instruments of the same greed, sucking the lifeblood from the very people they claim to serve.  Sinclair speaks of them as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"  Packingtown, it is a crucible, a testament to the darkness that can fester in the heart of man.",
            "Some writers, they find their way. They try to make you feel things, know things. Some ways work, some don't. Fitzgerald, he was one of them. In his book, *The Great Gatsby,* he does it with words, the way he lays them together. Sometimes he'll spin a word, a noun, with an adjective, something that don't quite fit. He builds a feeling around it, a certain hum.  \n\nHe does it with colors too. Gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. He takes these colors, gives them weight, then throws them out there, like stones in a pond. White and gray, he uses them most. White, it holds a kind of shine, a touch of class. Gray, it's older, faded. He lays it on early in the book, white and gray everywhere you look. Daisy and Jordan, they're always in white. Nick, he wears white flannels to Gatsby's party. Tom, he's got a white shirt on when he meets Myrtle. Even Catherine, she's powdered milky white. Only time they ain't in white, it's when Nick's lookin' around Gatsby's party, and the colors are all wrong, all loud.\n\nFitzgerald, he paints the world in these colors, even the small things. Nick goes down white chasms in New York, names at the party are gray, Catherine's apartment, a slice of a white cake. Gray cars, gray land, a gray child, a gray old man. He uses these colors to show you what ain't important, what's just part of the machine.\n\nThen he starts using them for Daisy. After a while, he brings her back, dressed in white, in a white roadster. She starts to feel less like a person, more like an idea, something Gatsby wants.  A gray haze around her fur collar. White again, before the big showdown. He makes you see her, not just as a woman, but as a symbol, a ghost in white.",
            "The land lies heavy with sun, a thirsty bounty in San Diego County. Tomatoes ripen, citrus hangs fat on branches, and greens unfurl beneath a sky that knows no winter chill. The soil yields squash, broccoli, herbs, and the sweet flesh of peaches and lemons.  Berries stain the tongue, honey drips from combs, and peppers burn with fiery heat. A hunger for the pure, the untainted, drives a market for the organic, a waiting list longer than the branches of an ancient oak. \n\nEggs, rich and yellow, and milk, creamy and cool, flow from farms that hold themselves apart, vowing to the earth a pact of sustenance and respect. These places, they beckon the weary traveler, offering paths through fields, a chance to walk where birdsong hangs in the air, a glimpse of life unburdened by the harsh hand of industry.  And they whisper of opportunity, of a way to turn the till of the soil into a harvest of profit and purpose, to weave a tapestry of bounty that benefits both man and beast.\n\nFor the land remembers, it holds the whispers of generations past. The echoes of Native hands that tilled the soil before the rustle of cattle hooves and the clang of axes. The ghosts of homesteaders who sought their fortune beneath this sun-baked sky. The earth remembers, and it yearns for a balance, a harmony that favors the delicate dance of life. \n\nThis land, a patchwork of chaparral, grassland, and oak stands, sits nestled against the vast canvas of the Cleveland National Forest. It is a haven for creatures both common and rare, a sanctuary for the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, their wings beating a frantic rhythm against the silence.\n\nBut the path is not easy. The land demands respect, a tireless dedication to its well-being. To coax life from the earth without the crutch of chemicals, to nurture the soil, to shepherd the flocks, it is a labor of love, a constant negotiation with the forces of nature. \n\nAnd so, the choice stands before us: to exploit the land for fleeting gain or to nurture it for a future where both man and beast may thrive. To choose a path that honors the whispers of the past and paves a way for a future where the land sings with life.",
            "Culture. A ghost in the machine. A thing not named but felt. It ain't no single thing, no monolithic beast. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, is to miss the truth. It's the dark and light, the hum and the silence, that make up the song. \n\nA man walks into a room, a foreign room, and he sees it through the lens of his own world. Comparisons bloom like weeds. To understand another's way, you gotta dig deep. History, prejudice, the whispers in the shadows. You can't judge, can't change it. You gotta accept it, its boundaries, its ways. Especially when you're down on your luck, at the table with less than your share. \n\nRespect the old ways, the beliefs that bind a people. It's a bridge over troubled waters. \n\nCulture ain't just nation to nation. It lives inside companies too. Some preach long hours, others a slower pace. You see it in the clothes they wear, the way they speak, who they choose to work with. Some give to charity, others build walls around their giving.  Look at America, with its thousand faces. A million cultures in a single land. Some cultures, they wear their differences on their sleeve. Others, they hide them deep, waiting to be uncovered.\n\nValues. They're the heart of a culture. Why they do what they do. If face is important, a man won't shame his leader. If hard bargains are the rule, he won't give in easy. Before you sit at the table, learn the song they sing. But learn it from the heart. Know the man across from you. That's where the real deal lies.",
            "The fool, the scriptures say, hath spoken in his heart, “There is no God.” These words, found in Psalm 14, mark the opening of Anselm’s argument, a plea for the truth of a God known only through the scriptures, a God of the Bible. Aquinas, another voice in this desert of doubt, echoes this belief. And since both men stand on common ground, seeking to prove the same God, we’ll assume for this reckoning that both are right. To wander beyond the confines of their God, the God of the Bible, would be to stray from the path laid out before us. To compare apples and oranges, so to speak. \n\nBut let us be clear: neither man offers a complete understanding, a whole cloth tapestry of belief. Their arguments, while valid in their own way, remain threads, incomplete and frayed at the edges.\n\nAnselm, he speaks of faith, of finding God within the soul, a reflection of the divine in the human mind. He argues that to conceive of God’s nonexistence is to fall into a contradiction, a hole in the fabric of understanding. God, he claims, exists within the very act of knowing, a truth glimpsed in the depths of our own being. Foreign evidence, he seems to say, is a distraction, a whisper on the wind compared to the roar of the truth within.\n\nAquinas, however, offers a different path, a path paved with reason and empirical evidence. He argues for a God whose existence can be proven, not through faith, but through logic and observation. This, he suggests, would be a boon to the spread of the faith, a bridge for the unconvinced. For who could deny the logic of his five proofs: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony? Each, he argues, points to a necessary conclusion, a missing piece in the puzzle of the universe, a God whose existence is as undeniable as the night sky.",
            "The world spun on.  A fifth century sun beat down on a prince born in the shadow of what was to come.  Buddha, they’d call him, though then he was but a shadow himself, a child in a world of dust and clamor.  He walked a path that led him away from the world, outward into the silence. He found light there, a luminescence that bloomed in the emptiness. Teachings spilled from him, riverborn and vast, carving out a path for those who sought to follow. Buddhism, they called it, a name that echoed across centuries.  Theravada, the oldest branch, a gnarled tree reaching towards a sky forever changing.\n\nTwo and a half thousand years had passed.  Sri Lanka, a jewel island in a sea of change, still bore the marks of that ancient light. There, in the heart of the island, men and women gathered for the water-cutting. Monks and layfolk, bound by a shared history, their faces drawn and weathered like the ancient banyan trees. A ceremony silent as the grave, a ritual born not of Buddha’s own hand but of the slow, insistent tide of time.\n\nThe change, it was everywhere.  From the threads of tradition to the bone of belief, the world had reshaped the faith. The Theravada community, cloistered in saffron robes or woven in the fabric of everyday life, had shifted. The doctrines, like the sands of the shore, had been swept and sifted, molded by forces both gentle and harsh.  Some spoke of internal tides, of whispers from within the faith itself. Others of external storms, of winds that carried the scent of other gods, of other ways. \n\nThose winds, they came in shades of gray, some carrying the sting of hostility, others a quiet indifference.  There was no telling where a gust would land, what it might leave behind.  But the faith, it endured.  Like the lotus that blooms in the mud, it found strength in the shadows, its roots anchored in the four noble truths.\n\nDukkha, the first truth, the ache of existence.  Samudaya, the source of suffering, the clinging to what could not be held. Nirodha, the cessation of suffering, the letting go. Magga, the path to liberation, a narrow trail winding through the tangled forest of the mind.  These truths, they were the compass, the map, the anchor in a world of relentless change.",

Fifty-seven years it stretched, from the year of the Alamo to the cusp of the Great War.  A war born of hunger, of land and ambition, that saw Texas fall to the north and the sunbaked plains of the Southwest claimed as spoils. (Diehl & Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  But it wasn't just guns and blood that fueled the fire.  Religion, culture, tradition—these things too, like tinder in the wind, ignited the flames.  (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dance of shadow and fire, it ain't unique to these two.  Borders breed friction, nations bump and grind against each other.  Pletcher, he said it plain: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41).  Proximity breeds suspicion, and suspicion breeds war.\n\nReligion, a serpent in the garden of nations.  Frahm, she wrote of the American aversion to the cross, to the crown, in the shadow of the old world's wars. (Frahm, 2001, p. 86).  Like the Cold War, a battle not just of steel but of ideology, of ways of life.  Here, the lines were drawn in the dust, not by communism or capitalism, but by faith.  The ghosts of the conquistadors, of English and Spanish, lingered still, a poison in the well of diplomacy.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed, these two nations, over land and blood and bone. (Diehl & Goerts, 2000).   Bandits and outlaws, shadows on the border, bleeding the land dry.  It took the iron fist of both armies to finally quell the storm. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).  But as Mexico leaned on the United States, the fever broke.  American hunger shifted from land to the gold that flowed from its veins.  (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109, 110)",
            "Fifteen years gone now. It came on sudden, this sickness. A thing I'd never heard of. I was a nurse then.  A choice made out of a need, see? For the kind of safety I'd never known as a boy. \"Always work, they said. People always get sick.\n\nThat's what they drummed into you, as you grew up. So even though the dreams were wilder - science, maybe, or chasing stories - I tended to the sick.\n\nNow here I was, forty-six years gone, single, pockets as empty as a graveyard.  The sickness stayed with me, fifteen years of it, living on what the state calls charity. Nothing left to call my own. It's a struggle every day, a gnawing at the edges of your soul. Security, safety, self-respect - all gone to dust. Nothing certain anymore, except this: I wouldn't have lasted without the help. Family, a few good souls.  You learn what strong really means when the world cracks wide open.\n\nLife throws you curveballs, big and small. No guarantees. You can plan and prepare, but some things are too big to shoulder alone.\n\nThey say we gotta be self-reliant in this country.  But God knows, that government's rotten to its core. I'd rather see folks trust each other again - lend a hand, ask for help when you need it. Not everyone out there building their own bunkers.\n\nThey talk about the individual, the rugged spirit that built this land.  But what kept those folks going weren't grit alone, it was looking out for one another. Those pioneers who crossed the mountains, they didn't make it alone. It was the shared burden, the compassion, the scraps of kindness.\n\nSo, be ready. I am. I've got my supplies: water, first aid, candles, canned goods. A stash of batteries, a wood stove - if you've got the space.  But don't forget the neighbors.  That's the real preparation.",
            "The question hangs, a dark thing in the mind: why do creatures take the shape they do? Are there unseen chains, invisible binds that dictate the course of change? Even now,  a century past when Thompson spoke of the zoologist's dream, a dream yet unfulfilled, the question remains. Though mathematics has begun to pry at the edges of this mystery, dissecting the lives of mollusks, tracing the thread of their form through time, the vastness of the unknown remains.\n\nOur own work seeks to peer into this darkness, to illuminate the mechanisms that drive the dance of form and function. We have looked at the bones of Prunum, their ancient geometries, captured in x-ray's stark clarity. From these images, we have extracted parameters, building blocks of form, feeding them into the cold logic of CerioShell.  We have sculpted specters, imagined shells, pushing the boundaries of what might be.\n\nThe shell, a spiral etched in time, a tube winding its way through the void. Each turn, a whorl, a testament to the slow, inexorable march of growth. The columella, a ghostly axis, runs through the heart of the spiral, a silent thread connecting past and future. The whorls expand, their pace a whispered secret, separated by sutures, faint scars marking the passage of time.  The body whorl, the final testament, a monument to the creature's journey. The spire, a fading echo of its past, its tip, the apex, a point lost to the relentless flow of time. And from this silent chamber, the aperture, a gateway to the living world.\n\nWe study the shell from every angle, apical, basal, apertural, abapertural, each perspective a different facet of the same story. Their paths unfold in a silent symphony, a ballet of coordinates, a testament to the hidden language of growth. By understanding these movements, we seek to unravel the grand tapestry of evolution, to glimpse the forces that have shaped the world around us.",
            "The dead came easy in those parts.  Children, mostly.  Mothers too. For a decade the numbers held steady, a grim song against the bone.  While the country aimed for some kind of merciful goal, some water cleansed and clean, the children kept dying.  The mothers too.  Not enough was done.  Not enough, not nearly enough.  \n\nThey said the birth attendants were more numerous now, a bigger percentage, but what good was that if they couldn't mend a broken thing?  Midwives, they called them.  Women with hands like old leather, knowing the ways of birth but powerless against the storm that brewed within.  Hemorrhage, they called it.  The river turned against them.  \n\nDiarrhea, too, took its toll.  Children, wasted and thin, slipping away.  Mothers, too, the care they needed, a whisper in the wind.  Cesarean sections, a rare sight.  Four percent they said.  In the cities, seven.  Out in the fields, two.  A line drawn across the land, separating the world into haves and have-nots. \n\nThe poor, they struggled.  Their bodies broke beneath the weight of it all.  Twenty-seven percent, the gap between rich and poor.  A chasm, a gulf.  \n\nWhat then, was to be done?  Programs, they said.  Band-aids on a broken body.  Targeted, they said.  Fast.  But what of the other wounds?  What of the system itself, rusted and brittle?  \n\nThe money, it flowed to the loudest cries.  HIV, they said.  Family planning, left to wither.  Duplication, they called it.  Forms, paperwork, a mountain of it all.",
            "The Victorians, they liked their stories ornate, all lace and velvet, fixated on those who wore crowns and held silver. But there were whispers in the shadows, tales that strayed from the gilded path. *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, they ain't your mama's tea party reads.  A darkness bleeds through their pages, a touch of the uncanny, a strangeness that claws at the edges of propriety.  It's in these shadows that the characters find their truth, their motivations laid bare, their souls exposed.\n\n\"And now, a swarm of thoughts, dark and tangled, filled his mind. He walked between Sikes and Crackit, their voices a venomous hiss, their words like stones in his ears. He tried to pull himself free, but found he was speaking to them, caught in their web.  A sudden crack, a flash of fire, a scream ripped through the air. Lights danced before his eyes, a maelstrom of sound and chaos, and then he was gone, carried away by unseen hands.  Through the haze, a gnawing pain, a constant ache, a torment that wouldn't let him be.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese two tales, they play with the edges of reality, with dreams and visions that twist the familiar into something unsettling. *Oliver Twist*, it peels back Oliver's layers, revealing the scars beneath, the pain that gnaws at his heart. When the bullet finally finds its mark, in a chapter marked 28, it's not just a wound, it's a re-living of the nightmare, a dream where he's trapped in the echo of the shot. He's adrift, numbed, unable to fight, his senses dulled, a puppet in the hands of fate.  Was it Sikes? Crackit? Or was it something more, something that lurked in the shadows, something that had a hand in his suffering?  The question hangs heavy, a weight on his soul.  Oliver, he's broken, stripped bare by the world's cruelty, a hollow shell of a boy, his spirit crushed under the heel of despair.\n\n\n\"The day bled into night, a fleeting shadow, a stretch of emptiness.  Night, it crept like a shroud, long in its silence, short in its stolen hours.\"",
            "A couple years back I was workin' in one of them after school programs, tutorin' young'uns. Elementary school, mostly. Tried to lend a hand wherever it was needed, but my head was always in the books, knowin' my way around English and readin' like a cat in a yarn shop. One of the teachers, he asked me about this kid, Adrian. Third grade, maybe fourth, couldn't make heads or tails of readin'. Seemed like somethin' was off, the way he handled words. Some he'd stumble through, others he'd spit out clean. It was a puzzle. Latino kid, I figured, though he spoke English like a native. We fumbled along for a spell, until one day the boy's mama walked in. She didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish. I was barely learnin' the lingo myself, but we managed a kind of broken conversation. And then it hit me like a bolt from the blue. Adrian, he could read just fine. The problem wasn't readin', it was the alphabet. He didn't know the letters like the back of his hand. Don't know if that realization did him much good, but I hope he's doin' alright.\n\nI tell this story 'cause it's a reminder about the wall that language builds. Here in California, especially, you see it everywhere. It ain't always as plain as day, though. A kid speaks perfect English, but readin' it can be a mountain to climb.  Everybody knows the problem exists, so what's the answer? For Adrian, it was simple enough. Tutorin', pointin' out the letters, lettin' him hear 'em spoken. But for kids who barely speak a word, it's a whole different beast. Ain't no single solution. Dual language, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of it's a magic bullet. You gotta mix and match, find the right combination for each child.\n\nDual language programs, they're a good start, a damn good start. Not just for Spanish speakers, but for all the kids. Studies show they learn better, outperform their classmates. Some folks get scared, say it's a waste of time, money, that it won't help the majority. But that's a lie. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, every kid would benefit. Now, should we make every teacher bilingual? No. That's just plain crazy. But there's no reason we can't have folks, helpers, tutors, whatever you call 'em, who speak both languages.",
            "From the cradle we are told there's a vastness out there, a thing beyond reckoning. Some are sent to pews and synagogues, others to the silence of their own minds. Many take the faith laid upon them, inherited like a coat too big. But some, they cast it off, eyes fixed on the self, a universe contained.  Values shift like desert sands.  We wander, then, each a pilgrim in the wasteland of belief, searching for a spark in the dark, a beacon against the cold.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, the word hanging in the smoke of our cigarettes. We sat on the porch, rain drumming a slow rhythm on the tin roof, drowning the thirsty plants at the edge. He looked out at the storm, eyes half-lost, half-remembering.  He'd thinned, the clothes hanging loose on his frame. His hair, what was left of it, was thin as winter wheat. He avoided my gaze, staring into the rain-soaked night. I felt a cold knot in my gut, fear and a silence too vast to speak. To say the words would make it real, a truth we both feared. So I held him, drew close, and watched the rain fall with him, the twilight a shroud upon the world.\n\nHe died in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The treatments, they bought him time, but not peace. An echo of what God had wrought, I thought, to prolong the suffering. Alone in the dark, I offered no prayers. If there was a God, he'd ceased to hear me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to watch him leave, the life that birthed me slip away. I wouldn't be a witness to his death. I'd remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone, better than his own kin. He wouldn't want me there, a silent specter at his end. I curled in my bed, a shadow in a shadowed room, waiting for the news.\n\nBut the news never came.",
            "The Gothic, a word that tasted of dust and stone, was an oxymoron, Watt said, a marriage of the old and new.  Praised and damned, it wore the mantle of the sublime, a terrible beauty that sent shivers down the spine.  Walpole, the one who birthed this beast, in his *Castle of Otranto,*  stitched together the threads of ancient romances and the nascent form of the novel, a newfangled thing that peered into the heart of man. He borrowed the ghosts of the theatre, the shadows of medieval times, and draped them across the landscape of the modern. A Gothic Story, he called it, a tale spun from the remnants of a forgotten age.\n\nGothic, you see, was a word that clung to everything and nothing. It meant old worlds and new, a jumble of styles and eras, all seen through the lens of a time that judged it archaic, a relic of a bygone barbarity. Yet, it was in this very incongruity, this clash of the timeless and the transient, that the Gothic found its power. It offered a glimpse into the darkness within, a reflection of the fears that lurked beneath the veneer of progress.\n\nOne of its most potent weapons was chivalry, a chimera of valor and honor, a code of conduct that had once defined the knights of old. In Walpole's hands, it became a symbol of a lost innocence, a yearning for a time when men were men and virtue reigned.  Frederic, the prince in *Otranto,* was a tapestry woven from these threads. \n\nThe description of him, a prince bereaved, a knight-errant marked by tragedy, was steeped in the language of chivalry. He was the epitome of the gallant knight, larger than life, a shadow cast from a fading ideal.  This exaggeration, this hint of excess, would become a hallmark of the Gothic, a way of pushing the boundaries of reality and exploring the darker recesses of the human soul.  Walpole, a man wrestling with the turmoil of his own times, may have seen in chivalry a reflection of a lost world, a world he believed had been consumed by the encroaching darkness of modernity.",
            "The flow of things. From want to want. Raw bone to bone, through the factory's maw and out onto the waiting shelves. That's what they call it, supply chain management. A word coined in 1982 by a man named Oliver, a consultant of sorts. He saw the whole thing, the planning and pulling, the push and shove of it all, the aim to satisfy the hunger in the belly of the consumer, quick and clean. Six pieces to the puzzle, he said. Production, supply, the holding of goods, the placement, the carrying, and the knowledge. Six things a man has to hold in his hand to serve the customer.\n\nProduction, the heart of it. The fire and the forge. The knowing of what the people want, what gnaws at their insides. The market, that's where you look. The market tells the tale. Demand, they call it. Once you know the thirst, you know what must be made, how much must be forged. Where the work is done, that's the next question.  The right place, the right hands. You consider the needs, the wants, and the satisfaction. And then the schedule, the rhythm of the work, the keeping of the tools. Every detail a thread in the web. A broken thread, a wasted stitch, and the whole thing unravels. I've seen it. In the aisles of Wal-Mart, Target, the endless rows. Each step, a book, a pattern, a ritual. No room for error.\n\nSupply, the next piece. The gathering of what's needed. The making of choices, the choosing of partners, the deciding of what stays in-house and what goes out. A single product, many parts, many hands. You must align the pieces. Some things stay close, others go far. Outsourcing, they call it. To make things move faster, cheaper, to keep the costs low. To find the speed, the flexibility, the agility.",
            "The sign hung crooked against the streetlight, a scrap of cardboard bearing the stark words: *Hitler is alive in Burma.*\n\nA shadow, the actress Ellen Page, stood beneath it, a lone figure against the city's indifferent glare. Burma. A land of shadows, ruled by men who held power like a fist. A junta, born in the dust of a coup,  a decade's silence broken by the saffron robes of monks, their protests a flicker of flame against the encroaching night.\n\nThe Saffron Revolution they called it. A fleeting moment of hope. But hope, like a candle in the wind, is easily extinguished.  They came for the monks, these men of iron, their boots heavy on the worn stone steps of temples, their weapons spitting fire.  Journalists, witnesses to the truth, were swept away, silenced. One, a man named Nagai, fell beneath the jackboots, his camera a testament to the world's indifference.\n\nThirteen they said. Thirteen souls lost. But a voice whispered in the dark, a soldier turned defector, spoke of a different number, a thousandfold toll. The blood ran deep, staining the earth crimson.\n\nThis is the way of things. Power, a hunger that devours all in its path. From Rome's Caesars to the emperors of the rising sun, the urge to control, to bend the world to its will, has haunted mankind.  And now, in this land, this shadow-drenched corner of the world, history repeats its cruel dance.\n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of souls rising against the iron fist.  Two hundred, three hundred, or two thousand, three thousand? The numbers blur, lost in the haze of official lies.\n\nRwanda, a nation torn asunder, where brother turned against brother, fueled by hate and whispers of ancient grudges.  And the echoes of a different horror, the Third Reich, a name that still chills the blood, a testament to the depths of human cruelty.\n\nThe world watches, turns away. The whispers fade.",
            "Duke Ellington's shadow stretches long across the jazz landscape.  His time, his presence, shaped the sound of the orchestra, a band of voices given form. The piano itself, his own hand on the keys, is often muted, a whisper against the thrum of the music. But as a composer, he wove intricate tapestries, each thread a solo, each note a brushstroke on the canvas of sound. He built frameworks for flight, for improvisation, but also penned tight, interwoven passages, calling on the individual souls of his musicians to bring forth light and shadow, to reveal the heart of the music.  He shaped the tone, the texture, the very soul of the ensemble, coaxing from them a sound both coherent and wildly original.  This mastery, this understanding of the voices within the whole, allowed him to birth some of the most singular and breathtaking pieces that jazz has ever known.\n\nThe Grove's dusty pages speak of his sound, his innovation. They point to \"Creole Love Call,\" where the voice itself becomes an instrument, stripped bare of words, a raw and vibrant thread woven through the fabric.  In this early work, he shows a knack for complementing the players, a skill that defines his legacy. This slow, deliberate blues, a twelve-bar lament, unfolds in six distinct choruses:\n\n* Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reed, the voice flowing smooth at first, then hardening, turning rough at the edge.\n\n* Chorus 2: The muted trumpet, a whisper of brass, elaborates on the melody, stretching out the blues notes, savoring their ache.\n\n* Chorus 3: The clarinet soars, a high-pitched cry, backed by the piano's subtle, syncopated pulse.\n\n* Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, a dialogue between brass and reeds, a conversation in sound.\n\n* Chorus 5: The climax, a surge of sound. The reeds now take the call, their voices high and insistent, driven by the brass and rhythm sections, a syncopated stop-time heartbeat.\n\n* Chorus 6: A return to the first chorus, voice and reeds in conversation again. This time, the voice adopts the growl, a raw, primal sound, a soloing instrument.\n\nA brief tag, a vocal run, a dissonant trombone note, a jarring end.\n\nThe voice, a color in the music's palette, a texture woven into the sound, this is a thread that runs through his work, a hallmark of Ellington's artistry. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" a year later, he marries his tight orchestration with his ear for color.  \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing exchange a call and response. Miley's trumpet becomes vocal, Cox's voice an instrument, and together they create a rich and vibrant sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" takes this further, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She'd always felt a hunger in her, a wanting that gnawed at the edges of her soul. It started when she was fourteen, coming into that strange bloom of girlhood. Now, three years on, at seventeen, the hunger remained, though sharpened, focused. It wasn't for things anymore. No, it was for a person. Someone to fill the hollow. But boys, they meant nothing to her. Some had tried, clumsy and earnest, to court her, but none had stirred a flicker. She'd wrestle with the strangeness of it, searching for an answer in the dark corners of her mind. Theories had formed and withered, leaving her with a gnawing emptiness. So she lived, adrift in a sea of questions.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, a stillness like the dust motes dancing in a sunbeam. Her parents, good and simple folk, spoke in low tones, their lives a gentle rhythm. Arguments were rare, a storm cloud passing quickly over a calm sky. The only discord came from her own restless spirit, her yearning for independence a thorn in their contentment.  They were the quiet kind, she, a whirlwind of laughter and energy, a spark against their calm.\n\nBut this day, the stillness was broken. A sharp cry sliced through the house, her mother's voice, clear and panicked, echoing from the kitchen. She raced in, her heart hammering against her ribs. \"Mom? What is it?\"\n\nHer mother lay sprawled on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Ow,\" she gasped, each breath a ragged shard of sound. The girl knelt beside her, fear a cold knot in her stomach. \"Mom, what happened? Where does it hurt?\"\n\n\"Sweetie,\" her mother choked out, \"Need... hospital.\"\n\nThe words were squeezed from her, a desperate plea. Her daughter, her heart a drumbeat against her ribs, knew the gravity of the situation. \"Alright, Mom, I'm taking you. Where should I drive?\"\n\nHer mother pointed, her hand trembling, and the girl, her muscles burning with a sudden strength, lifted her mother, her own fear a distant echo. \n\nThe hospital, a place of sterile smells and hushed anxieties, blurred past in a rush of urgency. The girl, her face set in grim determination, carried her mother through the doors, her voice ringing out, \"Help! We need a doctor!\"\n\nThe girl watched, her heart a tight fist, as doctors swarmed around her mother, their faces grave. They whisked her away on a gurney, leaving the girl alone with her fear, the silence heavy with worry.\n\nLater, the doctor explained. A fall. A misplaced stepstool. A vase. An accident.",
            "The study aimed to sift the truth from the dust, to see if a way of eating, the so-called Mediterranean Diet, could hold back the tide of heart disease and stroke. They called it the aMed diet, a kind of reckoning with the old ways, more plants and beans, less of the flesh and fat. Fish, olive oil, and a measured pour of wine were allowed, but the sugar and the red meat, they were to be kept at bay.\n\nOld studies had seen whispers of this, a link between the Med diet and a longer life, a quieter heart. But this new study dug deeper, wanting to know about the silent killers, the strokes that took lives in the night.\n\nThey followed women, 74,886 of them, nurses bound by duty and a shared hunger for knowledge. For twenty years, they filled out their food journals, recounting the meals, the bites, the sips. The researchers, like vultures circling, scrutinized their words, hunting for patterns, for the telltale signs of a life well-lived, or ill-lived. \n\nThey looked for heart attacks, for strokes, for the cold hand of death. They accounted for every factor, every habit, every vice. Age, smoking, weight, the pills they swallowed, the sun they basked in. They stripped away the layers, seeking the truth beneath. \n\nAnd what did they find?  The women who ate like the ancient Greeks, they lived longer.  Their hearts beat steady, their strokes fewer. A higher score on the aMed scale, a closer walk with the olive oil and the beans, meant a lower risk of dying young, of falling victim to the darkness.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, a house of cards built on sand, began to tremble. Unemployment crept like a shadow across the land. Homes, once symbols of security, stood empty, their windows vacant eyes staring into the abyss. Corporations, giants of steel and glass, crumbled like dust. The sickness spread, a contagion of bad blood infecting the very soul of the nation. How did it come to this?  \n\nThe architects of this ruin, those who held the reins of power, had dealt in hubris and folly. They had pressed banks and men of commerce to peddle subprime loans, seeds of destruction sown in an already fragile soil. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those pillars of the financial order, were compelled to weave a tapestry of mortgages, threads of risk spun into CDOs and CDSs, a house of mirrors reflecting a distorted reality. When the music stopped, the borrowers defaulted. The banks, stripped bare, passed the contagion on, infecting the body politic.\n\nThe roots of this rot ran deep, back to the Clinton years, a time of prosperity that masked the simmering discontent. The President, seeking to extend his own reign, loosened the reins of regulation, a dangerous gamble that would have dire consequences. The whispers of warning went unheeded.  Steven Holmes, a chronicler of the times, saw the coming storm. He wrote of Fannie Mae's pressure to expand its reach, to lend to those who could not repay, and foretold the government's inevitable intervention.  His words, like prophets of doom, went unheeded.\n\nThe new instruments of finance, complex and arcane, only served to entangle the nation further. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs, these instruments of speculation, fueled the flames of the housing bubble. The nation, drunk on easy credit, overleveraged itself, teetering on the precipice.\n\nThe bubble burst, a deafening cataclysm that shook the foundations of the world. The financial institutions, those who had bet on the rise, were left holding the bag. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, titans brought low. Lehman Brothers, dismantled, a monument to hubris. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, forced to abandon their reckless ways, transformed into creatures of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, drowning in debt, were placed under the government's control.\n\nThe wounds of this crisis are still raw, a reminder of the fragility of prosperity, the seductive allure of risk, and the consequences of unchecked ambition.",
            "Exposition. A barren plain where the writer's words stretch thin, a whimper in the wind. Or worse, a raincloud, heavy with too much telling and too little showing, blotting out the sun of the story. Dr. Merlin, she's known to spit on the keyboard when she catches herself drowning in it. Not the kind of drowning that's fun, neither. \n\nYou know the rule. Show, don't tell. But even the best of us stumble, caught in the snare of too much information. The devil on your shoulder whispers, 'Get it over with,' urges you to lay bare the past, to spill the beans, to carve the history into every line. But that's not storytelling. That's a lecture.\n\nThink of it like this: a film, the characters trading barbs, spitting out facts like seeds from a cracked gourd. A dump of details, a torrent. In fiction, it's the writer doing the talking, the narrator filling in the blanks, laying down the foundation with words that stick like glue.\n\nTake this: a story, a heroine, a lover lost. They meet, they marry, he dies.  Two pages spent on a life's sum, the words flat as cardboard, the characters hollow.  Where's the depth? Where's the ache of loss?\n\nShow me the man, the husband. Let his words sing, let his eyes reflect the love he holds. Show me the woman, how his presence shaped her, how her world bloomed under his sun.

Only then can you make me feel.\n\nAnd that, my friend, is the heart of storytelling.",
            "The television hummed, the light from the screen a sickly yellow in the dim room. Two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio, flickered across the screen. The first, NBC 4, live this morning, August the thirteenth, 2011. The lead story, a man, Shad Hostettler, a name like a bad wound, had stabbed his wife in Ashley.  They didn't name her. They showed his mug shot, an image of pure malice, and then moved on after two minutes. Multiple stabbings, they said, arrested. The details were thin, like smoke.\n\nThe next story, a younger man, Travis Buyers, eighteen years, shot in Sharon Woods, critically injured. No arrests, no suspects, only the echo of gunfire and the silent tread of the SWAT team. A quick glimpse, a fleeting shadow, as if the boy's fate mattered less.  It was the color of his skin, I thought, the shade of his neighborhood, that dimmed the light on this story.  Years I've watched this play out, a silent script of prejudice. A white child missing, a white man wronged, and the news would explode. A black boy shot, a black woman gone, and the sound is barely a whisper.\n\nThe helicopter, a Med-Flight, had been struck. A .22 caliber bullet, a whisper of violence against the sky. A five thousand dollar reward for information, a meager plea against the darkness.\n\nThe weatherman, a pale ghost against the green grass of a screen, spoke of thunderstorms and rain. The weekend, he said, mid-eighties. A tease, a promise of fleeting reprieve.\n\nA robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, they said, a hoodie pulled low, six feet tall, one hundred and fifty pounds.  They lingered on his blackness, as if it were the only detail worth knowing.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a drug kingpin from Texas, a name that tasted like dust and betrayal. He had conspired to bring marijuana into Ohio, they said, sentenced to three hundred months, a number that felt heavier, colder than twenty-five years. A Hispanic man, they noted, as if the color of his skin held some weight in the matter.",
            "The blood is thick. The tie that binds brothers, it cuts deep. It runs with love, yes, but with pride too. And jealousy.  And a cruelty that hides in the dark places.  Brothers see themselves in each other, clearer than any mirror.  The truth of that bond, it flares brightest in the firelight of hardship.   And it comes with a price. To understand the heart of brotherhood is to understand the weight of that price. To look into the eyes of your brother and see your own reflection, that's not the way the world sees you, no. That's the way you truly are. The deeds you do, the blood spilled, that's where the soul is laid bare.  \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk this path, across a landscape thick with green and shadow. Their journey, it's a fool's errand. The bitter sting of disappointment clashes with the iron grip of pride. Only one of them finds the strength to walk away. The story, it unfolds through the eyes of the boy who walks alone. The weight of his brother's burden, the weight of his own heart, it all spills out.\n\nPride, it's the engine that drives him. From their first clumsy steps together to their final, fateful climb, the boy is haunted by resentment. He yearned for a brother to teach, to share in the wildness of his own spirit. A brother to race with, to climb with, to share the secrets of the swamp. But Doodle, his brother, he was born frail, a bird with clipped wings. \n\nThe boy, he dreams of a different kind of brother. A brother who could keep pace, who could laugh in the face of danger. But Doodle, he's just a shadow, a fragile thing. The boy's dreams, they turn to dust. He even thinks, for a moment, of silencing Doodle forever.  But the boy, he hesitates. A small smile, a flicker of light in those fragile eyes, and the boy's heart, it softens.  The darkness recedes. But the seeds of pride, they remain.",
            "The human skull, a fortress of bone, houses a labyrinth of thought. A machine of flesh and fire, the mind has been likened to parchment, to ledger, to clockwork. Each metaphor a pale ghost of the reality within. The brain, a dark star, burns with its own light, a fire born of signal and echo.\n\nThe senses, tendrils reaching out, grasp the world. Touch, heat, sound, light - all transformed into whispers, into the language of the nerve. The brain, a tireless weaver, spins these whispers into meaning. Up from the raw material, bottom-up, the strands are bound, a picture taking shape. But the mind, a master of deception, knows more than the sum of its parts. Top-down, it reaches, guiding the strands, shaping the vision. A box, or a void? The brain decides.\n\nA gatekeeper stands, a vigilant censor. Attention, a flickering flame, illuminates the path, guiding the flow. A thousand blades of grass, a million whispers, drowned out. Yet a name, a whispered word, a beacon in the dark, cuts through the noise.\n\nMemory, a fractured mirror, holds the past. Sensory, fleeting; working, a brief flicker; long-term, a vast, silent archive. Information, encoded, stored, woven into the fabric of being. Some whisper of electrical currents, of looping signals. Others speak of proteins, of structures etched in the very essence of the mind.\n\nBut how is knowledge organized? A web, a map, a tangled forest? The mind, a closed book, its secrets yet to be revealed.",
            "The desert wind howled through the steel canyons of Huxley's Brave New World. A sun bleached landscape of conformity, its people were husks, programmed for pleasure and obedience. Their lives, a hymn to the machine, a testament to the siren song of capital. Aldous saw the coming darkness, the iron fist of technology encased in the gilded glove of progress. Community, they called it. A gilded cage where the individual withered, sacrificed on the altar of instant gratification.\n\nHe saw the World Controllers, their eyes cold and calculating, weaving the fabric of this dystopia.  Marx's ghost whispered in his ear, a specter of alienation and reification.  Homogeneity, the enemy of the soul, spread like a plague.  Huxley, the prophet, saw the proletariat, not in the factories of his time, but in the shallow eyes of the Deltas and Gammas.  Their desires, manufactured, their dreams, hollow echoes of a forgotten humanity.\n\nFalse consciousness, the Marxist specter, gripped them tight.  They were blind to the true relations of their world, their appetites stoked by the flickering screens of the World State.  Consume, they whispered.  Obey.  Be content.  The Alpha, the Beta, they knew better.  But their knowledge was a cold fire, a useless ember in the face of the machine.  They too were trapped, complicit in the system's slow, creeping decay.\n\nLove, a forgotten word, a relic of a time before.  Theirs was a world of shallow glances, of fleeting desires, of bodies fleetingly touched.  The human soul, starved of connection, withered in the sterile air.  The social order, a pyramid of oppression, stood firm.  \n\nHuxley's Brave New World was a warning, a stark reflection of a future not yet written.  A future where the machine devoured the soul and the individual, leaving only a hollow shell in its wake.",
            "The sun wore low in the sky above the sprawl of University Park. Two and a half years. That's how long I'd walked these cracked pavements, these endless quadrants of brick and mortar.  Four and a half semesters.  East Halls. They called it a dorm, but it might as well have been a outpost on the edge of some forgotten frontier. The wind whipped off the fields, carrying the ghost of autumn and the echo of distant football cheers.  My freshman year, that's where they sent me. A stone's throw from the stadium, a world away from Willard, that nexus of commerce and knowledge.  Twenty minutes, maybe more, to traverse the distance on foot.  The weather, a fickle mistress, often laid waste to the journey. Rain, snow, sleet. They all conspired to turn the asphalt into a slick, treacherous ribbon.  An old boy, not much older than myself, told me tales of a time when East Halls stood alone, surrounded by acres of vacant land. Now, that wasteland was a testament to progress. Fields of green, concrete leviathans like the Creamery and the new health center, and apartment blocks reaching for the sky. The campus, a beast in perpetual motion, was consuming itself, growing ever more sprawling, ever more disjointed. How to navigate this labyrinth?\n\nA friend, a fellow traveler on two wheels, had returned to the bike after a long absence. \"Why did I ever stop?\" he'd mused. \"Bikes are the answer,\" he'd said, his voice rough with conviction. \"It's the only way.\"  More than just a means of transport, the bicycle was a philosophy. A rebellion against the tyranny of cars and buses.  A commitment to efficiency, to freedom. A bowl of oatmeal and a few pedal strokes, and the miles would melt away.  \n\nI, too, had made the change.  Living off-campus now, just as distant from the heart of the university as some of those dorms, I'd bought a bike.  It was the smartest decision I'd made. My classes were in Thomas building, a quarter-hour walk at the very least. But on two wheels, it became a mere five minutes, a blur of motion.  Pollock Road, the artery connecting me to the university, was a hard road to travel. Not for the faint of heart.  Walking, I knew, was a virtue, but time, a commodity more precious than gold, was a luxury I couldn't afford.  Without the bike, I'd be tethered to the sidewalks,  another cog in the slow, grinding machine of the university.  Two and a half hours a week. That's what walking to Thomas building would cost me.  And that was just one class. Multiply that by all the others, all the appointments, all the errands, and the hours would bleed away, swallowed by the insatiable maw of time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

Service. Respect. Ethics. These are the stones upon which the house of social work is built.  Not just for the work, but for the man I wish to be.  Always, there was a pull towards helping. But the path remained shrouded. I saw too many souls fleeing their shadows, others seeking solace in hollow bargains. Witnessing these things, I turned to psychology. A degree earned, but the path still unclear. A summer stretched before me, a time for reckoning. A friend, a couch, a boy of sixteen, eyes wide with fear. He spoke of parents, of shadows in the home. The next day, the boy called for help, a bridge thrown across the chasm of his despair. I drove to the house, a tremor in my hands. I spoke to the officers, shared what I knew, the weight of my recent studies pressing upon me. But the law, it held its hands. They needed a different kind of truth. I spoke to the parents, their eyes flickering like dying embers. Evasive words, excuses wrapped in the cloak of blame. A child’s pain, dismissed as manipulation. That day, the path hardened, etched in the dust of their denial. \n\nJustice. A word whispered in the wind, but seldom heard. A society that claims to value the individual, yet herds us all into the same pen.  We mourn those lost, but celebrate sameness. I wear my difference like a shield, a testament to the fierce spirit that burns within. High school, college, a canvas for my dissent. Colors clashed, piercings broke the mold, words spoken against the tide of conformity. I stand with the marginalized, against the march of injustice. The fight is woven into the fabric of my being. This is the work I choose, to mend the broken, to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.",
            "The paper lays out the terrain of the sleeplessness. It probes the biological and the sociocultural. The biological, it delves into the genes we inherit, the flesh and bone of the body's workings. The sociocultural, it examines the world outside, the pull of place, the weight of circumstance, the shadows cast by race and class and the common fate we share.  This review, it seeks to map these territories, to trace the threads of research that bind them. It will dissect the findings, expose their strengths and frailties for all to see.\n\nSleep itself, a restless thing, can be a prisoner in its own right. Sometimes it's a primary affliction, a broken thing from the start. Sometimes it's a symptom, a hostage to the mind's own torment.  Sometimes it's a casualty, a victim of the body's ills or the poisons we take.  The Dyssomnias, they are the sleep disorders, the core of the problem. Insomnia, the scourge of wakefulness. Hypersomnia, the endless embrace of slumber. Narcolepsy, a thief of consciousness. Breathing disorders, the rasping breath of death at night. Circadian Rhythms, the body's clock gone astray. And then there are the Parasomnias, the nightmares, the terrors that stalk the sleep-ridden soul.\n\nBut this review, it focuses its lens on insomnia, a specter that haunts us all. And in its darkness, it seeks to understand the biological and sociocultural forces at play.\n\nThe biological model, it points to the genes and the brain. To the neurons in the hypothalamus, the tiny architects of sleep and wakefulness. The orexin neurons, they whisper secrets of slumber. This study, it delves into the world of mice, tiny reflections of ourselves.  They found that these orexin neurons, they bear the GABAB receptors, keys that unlock the gates of sleep. Activate these receptors, and sleep descends. Inhibit them, and the mind races, consumed by anxiety. The agonist baclofen, it pushes the body towards slumber.\n\nThis knowledge, it hints at a truth: our genes, our very flesh, can shape our sleep. A flaw in this receptor, a broken key, and the night becomes a battlefield. The implications, they ripple outward, touching every aspect of life. School, work, the mundane tasks of every day, all become a struggle in the grip of insomnia. And the sociocultural landscape, it too plays a role. If this genetic predisposition is inherited, passed down through generations, then the world around us, the pressures and burdens we bear, can amplify its effects.",
            "The paper lays down three things. First, what this thing is, this CAPD. Then, how it's found, the signs, the whispers.  And lastly, how a teacher might help a child caught in this maze, in a room full of other children.\n\nThis CAPD, this Auditory Processing Disorder, it's the way the mind takes in sound. The brain, the central nervous system, it's supposed to sift the noise, make sense of the whispers. But sometimes it falters. \n\nThey say the first talk of this came in the fifties, \"auditory imperception\" they called it. They were watching children, those who struggled to speak, to understand. In Italy, Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari, they were testing, searching for answers. Kimura, he brought in the dichotic test, a way to see how the brain sorts sounds. And then in '77, a gathering, a spark, more people looking at this unseen world.\n\nCAPD, it's a thief in the night, stealing the clarity of sound. A child might not hear things coming from a direction, or tell one sound from another. Patterns, they blur. The shift in a voice, the edge of sarcasm, lost. One sound drowns out another, or the clues, they all jumble, meaning lost. They can't hear the order, the sequence, the story sound tells.\n\nFinding it, diagnosing it, it's a slow dance. They watch, they listen, they test. Audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, they all hold the tools. Questionnaires, observations, sounds presented in a storm of complexity. No single test, no surefire answer. And the cause, it remains a mystery.",
            "Twelfth Night, it speaks of a darkness in the heart of man. A hunger for disguise, for the shedding of skin. A soul cloaked in borrowed flesh, walking a tightrope above the abyss.  The play whispers that such a dance can be a dance with the devil. For how long can a man live a lie before the lie becomes him? And what of the wreckage left behind?\n\nTo cast off the mask, to reveal the face beneath, is to risk the storm. Some will turn away, eyes glazed with hurt, hearts hardened by betrayal.  To speak the truth, to stand naked in the sunlight, is to choose solitude over the comfort of illusion.\n\nThis is especially true when the disguise is one of gender. Why, the play asks, would a soul seek to bury its true form beneath the shroud of another?  In Viola's case, it was necessity.  A shipwreck, a perilous journey, and a world that offered no solace to a woman alone.  \n\n\"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\" she says, \"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" Her words hang in the air, a testament to the fragility of her existence.\n\nBut the mask, it takes hold. It becomes a fortress, shielding her from harm, but also cutting her off from the solace of her own kind.  And in this twisted labyrinth of deception, she finds herself entangled with the nobleman Orsino, his heart drawn to the phantom she has become.\n\n\"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times,\" he sighs, \"Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nThe play dances with ambiguity.  Is Olivia drawn to Cesario because he is a man, or is there a deeper truth lurking beneath the surface?  Is this a reflection of the times, a mockery of societal constraints?  \n\nThe answer, perhaps, lies in the shadows.  \"A sister, you are she,\" Olivia declares at the end. The mask has fallen, the truth revealed. But the question remains: what price has been paid for this unveiling?",
            "The German hand, it left a mark on the land. A harsh one. The whispers speak of the Nama and the Ovaherero, wiped clean. A stain on the empire's ledger, a testament to the cruelty it could wield. But empires are not singular things. They breathe a multitude of airs, wear many masks. The German reach, it stretched far and wide, its policies as varied as the dust and the sun that beat upon its colonies. Education, that seed of knowledge, found fertile ground in some places, a barren waste in others. The Brits, when they took hold of East Africa, they found a people already touched by learning, their minds aflame with the torch of literacy. In Kamerun and beyond, the Germans, they too, spoke of progress, of the educating hand.\n\nBut South West Africa, that land of harsh beauty, it held a different tale. No state-sanctioned schools there, no grand structures of learning. The burden of education, it fell upon the shoulders of the missionaries, their meager efforts funded by a government that turned its gaze elsewhere. The white man, he was the recipient of a different kind of care. The Germans, they built schools for their own, nurtured their minds, their tongues, their souls. A double standard, etched in stone and dust.\n\nThe echoes of this divide, they linger still. While other lands boasted a tapestry of literate minds, South West Africa remained cloaked in darkness. The majority, they remained untouched, uneducated, their voices lost in the wind. The reasons, they are many, woven into the fabric of history. This paper, it seeks to unravel those threads, to shed light on the hearts and minds of the settlers, the colonial masters, and the natives they sought to control. \n\nThe past, it whispers, and we must listen.  Little has been written about the German empire, but what exists, it speaks volumes. The early accounts, they are like ghosts, their voices faint, their words written in a language that once held sway. They describe the systems, the methods, the failures. Later voices, they emerged from the shadows, comparing, contrasting, dissecting. They tell a story of disparity, of two colonies on a single continent, their fates entwined yet forever separate. Cohen, his name rings out, his work a beacon in the darkness. He saw the truth, the stark reality of South West Africa, a colony where education was a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe land itself, it offered a different kind of solace. Not a paradise, no. But a land of moderate temper, a respite from the scorching sun that blistered other lands.  Whites, they flocked to its shores, drawn by the promise of a new life. By 1913, they were fifteen thousand strong, a small army of settlers, a testament to the allure of the unknown.",
            "The music they call popular, it’s swelled like a river over a century, branching into a thousand tributaries.  Names for these branches, names for the music, they’re hard to catch, they slip through your fingers like water.  Rap, rock, country, jazz, folk – all of them, names just to make sense of the flood. And each one, they’ve spun their own webs of sub-streams, sub-sub-streams, a tangled delta of sound.\n\nHeavy metal, that’s one branch that’s grown thick and wild.  Forty years, maybe more, it’s been churning, churning up the darkness, churning out emotion raw and unfiltered. It’s not pretty, not always. It’s the kind of music that claws at you, that bleeds from the cracks in the world.\n\nThey’ve carved out niches in it, more than you can count.  A thousand shades of black, a thousand ways to scream.  What is metal then? Where does one branch end and another begin? It’s a question that hangs in the air, heavy as the guitar riffs.\n\nIt’s a movement, not just a genre. Metal is born of darkness, of the things we keep buried deep. More bass, more volume, more dissonance. It’s the music of excess, the music of the primal scream.  Skill, too, there’s a kind of mastery in the way they wield their instruments. They know how to play, and they play hard.\n\nAnd it’s fueled by something else, something dark and ancient. Drugs, they whisper, they were the fuel for the fire.  A fever dream in the seventies, a haze of possibility and despair. They say it’s in the music, the echoes of a lost world, the screams of a generation.\n\nBut it’s more than just drugs. Metal’s roots run deep, back to the Romantics, to the poets who sang of the night and the shadows. It’s a reflection of the darkness we all carry inside, the things we try to hide.\n\nTake the Beatles, even they dipped their toes in the dark. “Helter Skelter,” they called it, a song that spins like a runaway train, a descent into chaos.  Maybe it was the drugs, maybe it was something else, but it was a crack in their polished image, a glimpse of the darkness that lurks beneath.",
            "The Surrealists came after him, painting dreams on canvas. But Henri Rousseau, the postman painter, he was crafting his own dreams long before.  His *The Dream*, a canvas painted in the year nineteen ten, it ain't just a woman staring at the wonders of a dreamland. It's Rousseau himself, staring at the wonders he dreamed of, the recognition, the acceptance, the praise.  A painter with dreams like a burning ember in his chest, he yearned for the world to see his vision. But the world, it was a harsh mistress, demanding conformity, mimicking the styles of the day. \n\nRousseau, born in Laval, France, a son of a tinsmith, his life was a canvas of hardship. No schooling in the arts, just the drudgery of toll booths and the sting of loss. His wife, Clémence, gone, eight children lost, only Julia remained. Painting became his refuge, his solace. But the art world, it was a cold place. He toiled away, while Matisse and the others climbed the ladder of fame. \n\nJan Gordon, he wrote about them, two painters on different paths. Matisse, afraid to paint the trite, Rousseau, yearning for the familiar, for a place amongst the *Artiste Français*. He wanted to paint the way they wanted to see, to be accepted, to be seen. But inside, the dream was wild, untamed, a reflection of the man himself.",
            "Many a mind has pondered the bridge 'tween right and beauty, truth and grace. A kinship there be, a reason deep. Keats, in his ode to the urn, sang it clear: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn the ways of the world through book and experience, but these matters of ethics and aesthetics, they seep into us like the rain. They ain't taught, they're felt.  \n\nBoth strive to describe, not dictate. We study morality and beauty, trying to unravel the why of a brushstroke or a deed, not to lay down the law for what's good or bad. A man might talk for hours 'bout the Mona Lisa, dissecting color and shadow, but he'll never catch the heart of it.  You ask a man 'bout his favorite song, his favorite tale, and he'll say, \"There's just something about it,\" before he can string words to explain the rest. Art and morals, they ain't sumthin' to be wholly captured, like a fly in amber. O'Connor, she knew this well: \"A story is a way to say somethin' that can't be said any other way.\" No matter how we dissect it, there's somethin' left unsaid, somethin' that hangs in the air. Ethics, it's the same. Wittgenstein, he said it plain: \"Ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nMorality and art, they touch us in a way that's beyond words, a noumenal thing. They seep into the soul, leaving a mark that can't be erased. Literature, it's a double shot of this truth. McKean, he called it \"the moral quality\" that sets it apart.  We live by values, and literature holds them up to the light, letting us see them clear.",
            "The sun bleeds over the Alps, staining the snow-capped peaks a bruised purple.  Down in München, the air is thick with the murmur of a thousand tongues, each a thread spun into the tapestry of German culture.  It stretches east, a ribbon of language and custom, winding its way past the Rhineland, past Köln, where the great river sighs, past Dresden, where the Elbe whispers tales of a long-gone Saxony.  This land, forged in the fires of a thousand winters, is a crucible where tribes have clashed and mingled, their stories woven into the very fabric of the earth.\n\nGermania.  The name itself hangs heavy, a ghost from a forgotten time. Scholars, like moths drawn to a flickering flame, have scratched and clawed at its origins, seeking to unravel the secrets it holds. Tacitus, that old Roman scribe, claimed it came from the Tungrians, a tribe that crossed the Rhine, their steel singing in the clash against the Gauls. Caesar, the conqueror, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his chronicles of war, a word snatched from the Gauls themselves, a tool to divide the conquered from the unconquered. Some whisper it came from a spear, the \"ger\", a weapon of wood and iron, others from the guttural cries of battle, a roar that echoed across the plains.\n\nThe old Roman, Tacitus, in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", painted a picture of a people untouched by the tides of migration, a race abiding in their ancient home.  \"I should regard them,\" he wrote, \"as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\"  He saw a land unforgiving, a land of wild winds and sullen skies, a land where only the most hardy would dare to dwell.\n\nBut Rome, ever hungry for conquest, sent its legions to the borders of Germania, their legions hungry for gold and glory. They traded, they fought, but they never truly settled.  The Germanic tribes, fierce and proud, held their ground, their axes ringing against the Roman shields. They traded the bounty of their forests, their furs and their skills, and some even joined the ranks of the Roman legions, their loyalty bought and paid for.",
            "The view unfurled below, a dark and silent thing. I looked, my mind a vacant space. No thoughts took root, no judgments formed. Just the raw image, laid bare. Like water flowing, the impressions came and went, leaving no trace. \n\nAn old book lay open on my palm. \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" An artist's counsel, a promise of skill.  To see, to understand the lines, the shapes.  The world as a flat plane, a bowl of fruit suspended on nothingness. I'd tried that once, with a bowl of fruit, a kitchen, a room beyond. But the sight had swallowed me whole. A blue man, a green world, a rainbow of flesh.  If mine was to be a story, this was its canvas, its first brushstroke. Brown.\n\nThe tool felt heavy in my hand. Muscle memory took over, a practiced dance. But the water, it flowed and swirled, clear as a winter sky. And a speck, a fleck, a piece of myself, breaking free.  Then a spasm, a jolt, a desperate push. The porcelain held fast. Soiled and silent, a message left for the unseen.\n\nMop in hand, tie tight, I faced the aftermath. A curtsey to the mundane, a ritual of the uncelebrated. Flush, flush, the water churning. The world shrinks, then expands. A sheet, a glove, a pale shield. Slowly, deliberately, I dipped in. A mother's touch, a deathly embrace.",
            "Teenagers die behind the wheel. A confluence of factors pull them down, a dark vector in the statistics of young Americans. The Institutes, they say, the brain ain't built for it, not yet. Not ready for the road's cruel geometries. \n\nInEXPERIENCE, they call it.  And it's the heart of the matter. \nMore than just crashes, more than the mangled metal and broken glass.  It's the young ones who roll over, who push too hard, who drift off the asphalt's edge.  \n\nThey ride with their kind, these young ones.  Always with each other, like moths drawn to a flickering light.  The Californians, they studied it.  Age of the passenger, the accidents, a grim correlation etched in the data.\n\nThey've tried, these states, to build some kind of cage around them.  Provisional licenses, they call them, with hours and restrictions and limits. But a cage is just a cage.\n\nThe real problem, it cuts deeper.  They're not ready.  Not by the numbers, not by the measure of their own making.  Zuckerman, the psychologist, he says eighteen's too young.  Too young for the weight of the wheel, the responsibility of steel and rubber on asphalt.  They crave the rush, the sting of danger, a thrill that feels like living.  They're hungry for it, these young ones.\n\nAnd so they die.\n\nWe can't keep letting them die.  Laws, they say.  Schools, they say.  Education, they say. But the answer is simpler, starker.  \n\nWait.  Wait until the hunger fades, until the need for the rush subsides.  Wait until the numbers change, until the roads are safe again.\n\nWe owe them that much.  The dead, they owe us nothing.",
            "The Library of Congress, a repository of dust and echoes, held a trove of Edison’s earliest visions. Fifteen trick films, flickering ghosts from 1895 to 1901. Illusions spun from the raw threads of editing. My study, a sifting through these phantoms, sought to map the poetics of their artifice, to find the outliers, the whispers of something more. The trick film, a creature of its time, was bound to the stage. A frontal proscenium, a fixed gaze. No camera to wander, to chase. Long shots, medium shots, the actors confined to a horizontal dance, their fate sealed within the frame. One shot, one film. A rigid decree. \n\nBut even in this cage, there were tremors. A few, at the dawn of the century, dared to breach the walls. Multiple shots, a glimpse of something beyond the bounds. \n\nThe proscenium, a stage within a stage, was their prison and their stage. The camera, a silent sentinel, never shifted its gaze.  Bound by the theatre, by vaudeville’s shadow, by the conjuror’s art. Movement was a sideways sway, a waltz across the stage’s edge. Take “Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,” a film from 1900. The actors, trapped in their spectral dance, move left and right, vanishing and reappearing, but never venturing towards or from the camera’s cold eye. \n\nLong shots, the vast majority. Medium shots, a fleeting respite. Close-ups, the intimacy of the human face, absent. The audience, like the stage, witnessed everything, framed by the immutable borders.\n\nOne conceptual shot, one film. A minute or less, a fleeting glimpse of a world built on illusion. A vaudeville trick, a disappearance, a sleight of hand. A story, if there was one, was thin, a wisp of smoke. \n\nYet, in the eye of the beholder, a single shot could be a tapestry.  A joining of fragments, a conjuring of the impossible. Look closer, at “The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,” a film from 1895. The severed head, a phantom limb, a moment of physical reality in a world of artifice. One shot, the camera never blinks, but the illusion is built on pieces, on the careful joining of fragments.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the soil, was a firebrand for Republicanism, his voice ringing out for freedom and the land. Though a farmer by trade, his calloused hands held the weight of a life steeped in politics, a life etched by the struggle against tyranny. His faith, absolute, rested in the agrarian way, a way of life he saw as the cornerstone of true liberty.  It was this conviction, this reverence for the tiller, that colored his pronouncements on sovereignty, on the Constitution's sacred parchment, even on the men who sat in judgment.\n\nHe saw in the newly formed nation a chance, a clean slate, unburdened by the ghosts of old world systems.  With no inherited lineage to bind them, the architects of this government could build anew, a republic of self-reliance, a testament to the inherent rights of man.  These rights, he believed, were woven into the very fabric of existence, each one indivisible, each one a thread in the tapestry of freedom. To deny one was to unravel them all, leaving the remaining threads tattered and weak.\n\nThe state, he argued, was a necessary evil, a bulwark against the darkness within man, the primal struggle between good and evil that raged within every soul.  He saw in the human heart both the capacity for great good and the potential for monstrous deeds.  \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.\"  His vision of a righteous government rested on principles that protected property, nurtured the land, and tempered the excesses of capital. A government, he believed, built on such principles would endure, its administration fleeting, a mere shadow cast by the eternal light of justice.\n\nTaylor, like many of his brethren, called for a strict reading of the Constitution, a razor's edge against the encroaching tide of federal power. He saw in a bloated government the seeds of tyranny, a leviathan fueled by avarice and consumed by its own appetites. Yet, he cautioned against a blind adherence to the letter of the law, for without understanding the intent of the framers, the words could become a weapon, twisted and corrupted.  He looked to the Declaration of Independence, the true testament of the nation's birth, as a guiding light, a beacon reminding them that the states were sovereign, not pawns in a centralized game.",
            "The numbers dipped in the third month, a sharp fall like stones from a high ledge. Figure 17 shows it plain. Why? The wind turned cold, winter coming on, a New England bite. Bikes and feet, they stay in the shed. December. The semester's end, a scramble for grades, for knowledge and completion. A log gets misplaced in the rush.  And then the holidays, a long dark peace settling over the campus. Students gone, faculty too, no need for paths to tread. Come January, classes start up again, a trickle of logs. But February, that's a mystery.\n\nPerhaps the fire of new things burns bright, then fades. A natural thing. To counter that, we built a fire anew, a week of challenges, a blitz of carpooling.  The logs climbed, a flicker of hope in March.  But the heart of the matter, the challenge, was to keep the flame burning. Winter's chill, the breaks in the year, they all pull at the soul, make it hard to keep going.\n\nAnother thing, people like their cars. It's the way they move, free as the wind. A deep thing, woven into the fabric of this land.  So we offered gifts, tokens of appreciation:  coffee, meals, a rub of the back, books, even the trinkets of the chain stores.  Maybe something bigger would have worked, a bicycle, a car that breathed clean air, a promise of the open road. Would it have kept the logs full? Would it have caught the fire again?\n\nThe gifts stayed the same, a steady thing. But what if they grew, a slow crescendo? A bicycle here, a car there, announced in the cold months.  A promise of something more, a beacon in the darkness.",
            "The thing they call an ETF, an Exchange Traded Fund, is a kind of paper promise. It's built to follow the moves of a market index, or maybe a single commodity, or a basket of things like some kind of index fund. But it's quicker, slicker. Trades like a stock, on the board, with all the flash and the risk.  \n\nYou get the spread of the index, the supposed safety in numbers, but with the bite of a single stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, even own just a sliver, a single share, if that's all you got.\n\nThey say it's cheaper, these ETFs, the fees lower than the mutual fund kind. But there's a price, always a price. Every trade, a commission, like a toll to pass through the gates. \n\nAnd the choices, they've got a whole damn army of these ETFs, each one promising something different. But a smart man, a man who knows the way the world turns, he knows to ask: do these promises hold water? Does the spread truly exist, or is it just another illusion?\n\nWe're lookin' at one, IHF they call it.  We're gonna cut through the noise, focus on the top ten.  They hold most of the weight, 63.58% of the whole damn thing.\n\nTo see if these ten hold the same promise as the whole ETF, we gotta look at their fingerprints. We'll measure their Beta, their risk, and their Return, see if they paint the same picture as the whole shebang.\n\nWe'll lay it all out: the numbers, the percentages, the risks and the rewards.  Because in this game, the truth ain't always what it seems.",
            "Dream-Land. One of Poe's own pronouncements, a better poem. But the word Thule, it hangs there, twice in the piece, a ghost from Virgil's pen. Mabbott, he says it's Virgil, an island north of Britain, the edge of what men knew. And Virgil did use it, yes. But there's a shadow, a closer echo. Poe, he hungered for the German tongue.  \n\nArndt, he saw the kinship, in Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon. A borrowed melody, a likeness in the dark. The Oxford Companion, it speaks of Goethe, the man who spun the tapestry of Faust, a tale in two parts, first in '08, the second on the day he breathed his last, '32. Within that second part, a poem, The King of Thule. A king, his queen gone, a goblet offered, a poisoned gift. He drinks, he weeps, a hollow man, and in the end, he walks to the edge, the goblet flung to the sea, eyes closed, and the darkness claims him. \n\nTwo shades, the King of Thule and the man in Dream-Land, a mirror held to Poe's own sorrow, the whisky a solace. Faust, it was brought to the stage by Grattan, just a year before Poe's own Thule in The Pit and the Pendulum. \n\nTwice does Poe speak of Thule, once in the darkness of The Pit, and twice in Dream-Land, bookends to his dream. Companion pieces, they are. The speaker in Dream-Land, he walks through the landscape of Thule, a world drained of color, a haunted place. The King of Thule, he too is haunted, his loss a wound that bleeds.\n\nGoethe, a giant in Poe's world, a presence felt even through the respect Poe held for Tennyson.  The world teemed with Goethe's words, echoes in the wake of his own.",
            "The law in this California dust bowl says a man hurt by a slick of applesauce on the floor of a market might be owed more than just his medicine. He might be owed a reckoning. The question is, would the law see malice in the manager's eyes, a cold disregard for the man's well-being?\n\nJennifer Palmer, that's the woman who took a tumble.  She says the manager, Martin, knew about the spill. Knew it twice. Told by two different souls, one named Wayne, the other Haddigan. But Martin, he was on his own supper, and said he had no time for the cries of customers. Half an hour passed. The spill remained. Then Palmer came along. She fell hard, her back a cracked thing now.\n\nThe law speaks of malice. It speaks of a willfulness, a knowing disregard. And it speaks of a conduct so base, so foul, it's barely human. Could the manager be said to have done this with malice aforethought?\n\nThe six slips and falls that had happened that year at this same store, the same aisle, their story hangs in the air like the smell of rot.  Did Martin see those past falls and turn away? Did he see the danger and choose to ignore it, to profit off the chance of another's pain?\n\nWe're looking at the law here, the cold law. We're looking for the lines, the boundaries of what can be called malice. Did this manager act with a heart of stone? That's the question that hangs over this case, heavy as a storm cloud in the valley.",
            "Four years gone now, a course in Islam at CBC.  A fire in the classroom, the question burning: was it a faith of hostility? Now more than ever, the question hangs heavy.  Seen it shift, the media's view. From the shadow of the towers, a hatred, a fear.  Then a turning, a tide of tolerance, a turning so swift it scarcely seems possible. Now, a man named Obama, a name like a whispered prayer, a man of faith, stands in the light of the highest office. Could that have been in 2001?\n\nThe Prophet's story, it's a riddle.  What I knew, what I thought I knew, was a man of conquest, a sword raised. Tribes subdued, forced to bend the knee, to swallow the faith.  But this biography, it paints a different picture.  A man humbled, misunderstood, a martyr.  Truth, it whispers, not force.  People drawn to him, seeking the light.\n\nThe echoes, they are there. Jesus and Muhammad. The loaves and fishes, a mirror held to the desert.  Forty men fed, a hand raised, a miracle.  It's a way of telling the story, a way of making him seem less, a man of quiet faith, of truth lived, not proven.  But the truth, it cuts like a knife. It doesn't discount the miracle, the life, the man who walked on water. It's a shadow cast, a theft, a reaching for the light of another.\n\nAnd the witnesses, the stories told and retold, a game of telephone.  He said, she said, whispers in the wind.  A third party, a shroud over the truth, a cloud of doubt.  It's supposed to prove, to solidify, but it does the opposite.  It unravels, it weakens.\n\nThe thing that sits heaviest is the way they try to build him up, Muhammad, a saint, a gentle soul.  History, it whispers a different tale.  A man of power, a man of ambition.  Do they, the faithful, know the truth?  Do they know the man beneath the legend?",
            "The man’s words, the words of the Nazarene, they drifted away like dust on a wind.  The Church, like a river swollen and twisting, bore him onward, past the quiet pools where his words had first been spoken.  A strange turning, this.  The world now pressed ever onward, a tide of change pulling at the edges of belief.  Some clung to the old ways, to the shore, their eyes fixed on the familiar.  But the tide would not be denied. \n\nA hunger would rise, a yearning to find the wellspring, the pure water of the man's original message.  Decades, centuries, the river would carve its path, stripping away the layers, the stones added over time.  Until, at last, the bedrock remained – the man himself, and the echo of his voice.  And the Church, a weathered granite structure, would stand, its foundations deepened, its purpose redefined. \n\nFrom sea to shining sea, the change would come.  Diversity would give way to unity.  A single creed, a single song, a single vision.  History, a winding path, knew this turn.  It had seen the Roman Eagle fall, the whip of the past replaced by the cross.  It had seen the chains broken, the slave lifted to the seat of power.  And now, the river of faith would turn again, seeking the source, the beginning. \n\nThis would not be a rejection, but a return.  The words, once read as stone, would be seen as water, flowing, changing, ever-present.  And the story, the great story, would begin anew.  \n\nFar back, in the dust and heat, there was only Judaism.  A single light, a single truth, the whispered word of God.  And within that light, the seeds of the man's message were planted.  The Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Zealots – they were all branches of that same tree, reaching for the same sun.",
            "The Jungle, it lays bare the sin in man. A greed that gnaws deep, a hunger that knows no satiation. These folks, they claw and scramble, each for themselves, oblivious to the dust and the blood staining the ground beneath their feet. The factory owners, they are monuments to this hunger. Their eyes, they gleam with the cold fire of profit, their ears deaf to the cries of the workers, the pain of the land. Sinclair's words paint a picture of the smoke-choked sky, the river of industry blackening the horizon. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\"  They see only the bottom line, these men, deaf to the suffering their hunger inflicts. The workers, they are cogs, expendable, replaceable.  \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Hours stretch on, long and grueling, until the day comes when the axe falls, leaving them cast out, adrift in a sea of despair.  And these men, they fight, yes, they form unions, but even those become instruments of the same greed, sucking the lifeblood from the very people they claim to serve.  Sinclair speaks of them as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"  Packingtown, it is a crucible, a testament to the darkness that can fester in the heart of man.",
            "Some writers, they find their way. They try to make you feel things, know things. Some ways work, some don't. Fitzgerald, he was one of them. In his book, *The Great Gatsby,* he does it with words, the way he lays them together. Sometimes he'll spin a word, a noun, with an adjective, something that don't quite fit. He builds a feeling around it, a certain hum.  \n\nHe does it with colors too. Gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. He takes these colors, gives them weight, then throws them out there, like stones in a pond. White and gray, he uses them most. White, it holds a kind of shine, a touch of class. Gray, it's older, faded. He lays it on early in the book, white and gray everywhere you look. Daisy and Jordan, they're always in white. Nick, he wears white flannels to Gatsby's party. Tom, he's got a white shirt on when he meets Myrtle. Even Catherine, she's powdered milky white. Only time they ain't in white, it's when Nick's lookin' around Gatsby's party, and the colors are all wrong, all loud.\n\nFitzgerald, he paints the world in these colors, even the small things. Nick goes down white chasms in New York, names at the party are gray, Catherine's apartment, a slice of a white cake. Gray cars, gray land, a gray child, a gray old man. He uses these colors to show you what ain't important, what's just part of the machine.\n\nThen he starts using them for Daisy. After a while, he brings her back, dressed in white, in a white roadster. She starts to feel less like a person, more like an idea, something Gatsby wants.  A gray haze around her fur collar. White again, before the big showdown. He makes you see her, not just as a woman, but as a symbol, a ghost in white.",
            "The land lies heavy with sun, a thirsty bounty in San Diego County. Tomatoes ripen, citrus hangs fat on branches, and greens unfurl beneath a sky that knows no winter chill. The soil yields squash, broccoli, herbs, and the sweet flesh of peaches and lemons.  Berries stain the tongue, honey drips from combs, and peppers burn with fiery heat. A hunger for the pure, the untainted, drives a market for the organic, a waiting list longer than the branches of an ancient oak. \n\nEggs, rich and yellow, and milk, creamy and cool, flow from farms that hold themselves apart, vowing to the earth a pact of sustenance and respect. These places, they beckon the weary traveler, offering paths through fields, a chance to walk where birdsong hangs in the air, a glimpse of life unburdened by the harsh hand of industry.  And they whisper of opportunity, of a way to turn the till of the soil into a harvest of profit and purpose, to weave a tapestry of bounty that benefits both man and beast.\n\nFor the land remembers, it holds the whispers of generations past. The echoes of Native hands that tilled the soil before the rustle of cattle hooves and the clang of axes. The ghosts of homesteaders who sought their fortune beneath this sun-baked sky. The earth remembers, and it yearns for a balance, a harmony that favors the delicate dance of life. \n\nThis land, a patchwork of chaparral, grassland, and oak stands, sits nestled against the vast canvas of the Cleveland National Forest. It is a haven for creatures both common and rare, a sanctuary for the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, their wings beating a frantic rhythm against the silence.\n\nBut the path is not easy. The land demands respect, a tireless dedication to its well-being. To coax life from the earth without the crutch of chemicals, to nurture the soil, to shepherd the flocks, it is a labor of love, a constant negotiation with the forces of nature. \n\nAnd so, the choice stands before us: to exploit the land for fleeting gain or to nurture it for a future where both man and beast may thrive. To choose a path that honors the whispers of the past and paves a way for a future where the land sings with life.",
            "Culture. A ghost in the machine. A thing not named but felt. It ain't no single thing, no monolithic beast. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, is to miss the truth. It's the dark and light, the hum and the silence, that make up the song. \n\nA man walks into a room, a foreign room, and he sees it through the lens of his own world. Comparisons bloom like weeds. To understand another's way, you gotta dig deep. History, prejudice, the whispers in the shadows. You can't judge, can't change it. You gotta accept it, its boundaries, its ways. Especially when you're down on your luck, at the table with less than your share. \n\nRespect the old ways, the beliefs that bind a people. It's a bridge over troubled waters. \n\nCulture ain't just nation to nation. It lives inside companies too. Some preach long hours, others a slower pace. You see it in the clothes they wear, the way they speak, who they choose to work with. Some give to charity, others build walls around their giving.  Look at America, with its thousand faces. A million cultures in a single land. Some cultures, they wear their differences on their sleeve. Others, they hide them deep, waiting to be uncovered.\n\nValues. They're the heart of a culture. Why they do what they do. If face is important, a man won't shame his leader. If hard bargains are the rule, he won't give in easy. Before you sit at the table, learn the song they sing. But learn it from the heart. Know the man across from you. That's where the real deal lies.",
            "The fool, the scriptures say, hath spoken in his heart, “There is no God.” These words, found in Psalm 14, mark the opening of Anselm’s argument, a plea for the truth of a God known only through the scriptures, a God of the Bible. Aquinas, another voice in this desert of doubt, echoes this belief. And since both men stand on common ground, seeking to prove the same God, we’ll assume for this reckoning that both are right. To wander beyond the confines of their God, the God of the Bible, would be to stray from the path laid out before us. To compare apples and oranges, so to speak. \n\nBut let us be clear: neither man offers a complete understanding, a whole cloth tapestry of belief. Their arguments, while valid in their own way, remain threads, incomplete and frayed at the edges.\n\nAnselm, he speaks of faith, of finding God within the soul, a reflection of the divine in the human mind. He argues that to conceive of God’s nonexistence is to fall into a contradiction, a hole in the fabric of understanding. God, he claims, exists within the very act of knowing, a truth glimpsed in the depths of our own being. Foreign evidence, he seems to say, is a distraction, a whisper on the wind compared to the roar of the truth within.\n\nAquinas, however, offers a different path, a path paved with reason and empirical evidence. He argues for a God whose existence can be proven, not through faith, but through logic and observation. This, he suggests, would be a boon to the spread of the faith, a bridge for the unconvinced. For who could deny the logic of his five proofs: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony? Each, he argues, points to a necessary conclusion, a missing piece in the puzzle of the universe, a God whose existence is as undeniable as the night sky.",
            "The world spun on.  A fifth century sun beat down on a prince born in the shadow of what was to come.  Buddha, they’d call him, though then he was but a shadow himself, a child in a world of dust and clamor.  He walked a path that led him away from the world, outward into the silence. He found light there, a luminescence that bloomed in the emptiness. Teachings spilled from him, riverborn and vast, carving out a path for those who sought to follow. Buddhism, they called it, a name that echoed across centuries.  Theravada, the oldest branch, a gnarled tree reaching towards a sky forever changing.\n\nTwo and a half thousand years had passed.  Sri Lanka, a jewel island in a sea of change, still bore the marks of that ancient light. There, in the heart of the island, men and women gathered for the water-cutting. Monks and layfolk, bound by a shared history, their faces drawn and weathered like the ancient banyan trees. A ceremony silent as the grave, a ritual born not of Buddha’s own hand but of the slow, insistent tide of time.\n\nThe change, it was everywhere.  From the threads of tradition to the bone of belief, the world had reshaped the faith. The Theravada community, cloistered in saffron robes or woven in the fabric of everyday life, had shifted. The doctrines, like the sands of the shore, had been swept and sifted, molded by forces both gentle and harsh.  Some spoke of internal tides, of whispers from within the faith itself. Others of external storms, of winds that carried the scent of other gods, of other ways. \n\nThose winds, they came in shades of gray, some carrying the sting of hostility, others a quiet indifference.  There was no telling where a gust would land, what it might leave behind.  But the faith, it endured.  Like the lotus that blooms in the mud, it found strength in the shadows, its roots anchored in the four noble truths.\n\nDukkha, the first truth, the ache of existence.  Samudaya, the source of suffering, the clinging to what could not be held. Nirodha, the cessation of suffering, the letting go. Magga, the path to liberation, a narrow trail winding through the tangled forest of the mind.  These truths, they were the compass, the map, the anchor in a world of relentless change.",
            "The United States and Mexico. Two nations bound by a border, by history, by a feud that ran deep as the Rio Grande itself. Fifty-seven years it stretched, from the year of the Alamo to the cusp of the Great War.  A war born of hunger, of land and ambition, that saw Texas fall to the north and the sunbaked plains of the Southwest claimed as spoils. (Diehl & Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  But it wasn't just guns and blood that fueled the fire.  Religion, culture, tradition—these things too, like tinder in the wind, ignited the flames.  (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dance of shadow and fire, it ain't unique to these two.  Borders breed friction, nations bump and grind against each other.  Pletcher, he said it plain: \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems.\" (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41).  Proximity breeds suspicion, and suspicion breeds war.\n\nReligion, a serpent in the garden of nations.  Frahm, she wrote of the American aversion to the cross, to the crown, in the shadow of the old world's wars. (Frahm, 2001, p. 86).  Like the Cold War, a battle not just of steel but of ideology, of ways of life.  Here, the lines were drawn in the dust, not by communism or capitalism, but by faith.  The ghosts of the conquistadors, of English and Spanish, lingered still, a poison in the well of diplomacy.\n\nSeventeen times they clashed, these two nations, over land and blood and bone. (Diehl & Goerts, 2000).   Bandits and outlaws, shadows on the border, bleeding the land dry.  It took the iron fist of both armies to finally quell the storm. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).  But as Mexico leaned on the United States, the fever broke.  American hunger shifted from land to the gold that flowed from its veins.  (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109, 110)",
            "Fifteen years gone now. It came on sudden, this sickness. A thing I'd never heard of. I was a nurse then.  A choice made out of a need, see? For the kind of safety I'd never known as a boy. \"Always work, they said. People always get sick.\n\nThat's what they drummed into you, as you grew up. So even though the dreams were wilder - science, maybe, or chasing stories - I tended to the sick.\n\nNow here I was, forty-six years gone, single, pockets as empty as a graveyard.  The sickness stayed with me, fifteen years of it, living on what the state calls charity. Nothing left to call my own. It's a struggle every day, a gnawing at the edges of your soul. Security, safety, self-respect - all gone to dust. Nothing certain anymore, except this: I wouldn't have lasted without the help. Family, a few good souls.  You learn what strong really means when the world cracks wide open.\n\nLife throws you curveballs, big and small. No guarantees. You can plan and prepare, but some things are too big to shoulder alone.\n\nThey say we gotta be self-reliant in this country.  But God knows, that government's rotten to its core. I'd rather see folks trust each other again - lend a hand, ask for help when you need it. Not everyone out there building their own bunkers.\n\nThey talk about the individual, the rugged spirit that built this land.  But what kept those folks going weren't grit alone, it was looking out for one another. Those pioneers who crossed the mountains, they didn't make it alone. It was the shared burden, the compassion, the scraps of kindness.\n\nSo, be ready. I am. I've got my supplies: water, first aid, candles, canned goods. A stash of batteries, a wood stove - if you've got the space.  But don't forget the neighbors.  That's the real preparation.",
            "The question hangs, a dark thing in the mind: why do creatures take the shape they do? Are there unseen chains, invisible binds that dictate the course of change? Even now,  a century past when Thompson spoke of the zoologist's dream, a dream yet unfulfilled, the question remains. Though mathematics has begun to pry at the edges of this mystery, dissecting the lives of mollusks, tracing the thread of their form through time, the vastness of the unknown remains.\n\nOur own work seeks to peer into this darkness, to illuminate the mechanisms that drive the dance of form and function. We have looked at the bones of Prunum, their ancient geometries, captured in x-ray's stark clarity. From these images, we have extracted parameters, building blocks of form, feeding them into the cold logic of CerioShell.  We have sculpted specters, imagined shells, pushing the boundaries of what might be.\n\nThe shell, a spiral etched in time, a tube winding its way through the void. Each turn, a whorl, a testament to the slow, inexorable march of growth. The columella, a ghostly axis, runs through the heart of the spiral, a silent thread connecting past and future. The whorls expand, their pace a whispered secret, separated by sutures, faint scars marking the passage of time.  The body whorl, the final testament, a monument to the creature's journey. The spire, a fading echo of its past, its tip, the apex, a point lost to the relentless flow of time. And from this silent chamber, the aperture, a gateway to the living world.\n\nWe study the shell from every angle, apical, basal, apertural, abapertural, each perspective a different facet of the same story. Their paths unfold in a silent symphony, a ballet of coordinates, a testament to the hidden language of growth. By understanding these movements, we seek to unravel the grand tapestry of evolution, to glimpse the forces that have shaped the world around us.",
            "The dead came easy in those parts.  Children, mostly.  Mothers too. For a decade the numbers held steady, a grim song against the bone.  While the country aimed for some kind of merciful goal, some water cleansed and clean, the children kept dying.  The mothers too.  Not enough was done.  Not enough, not nearly enough.  \n\nThey said the birth attendants were more numerous now, a bigger percentage, but what good was that if they couldn't mend a broken thing?  Midwives, they called them.  Women with hands like old leather, knowing the ways of birth but powerless against the storm that brewed within.  Hemorrhage, they called it.  The river turned against them.  \n\nDiarrhea, too, took its toll.  Children, wasted and thin, slipping away.  Mothers, too, the care they needed, a whisper in the wind.  Cesarean sections, a rare sight.  Four percent they said.  In the cities, seven.  Out in the fields, two.  A line drawn across the land, separating the world into haves and have-nots. \n\nThe poor, they struggled.  Their bodies broke beneath the weight of it all.  Twenty-seven percent, the gap between rich and poor.  A chasm, a gulf.  \n\nWhat then, was to be done?  Programs, they said.  Band-aids on a broken body.  Targeted, they said.  Fast.  But what of the other wounds?  What of the system itself, rusted and brittle?  \n\nThe money, it flowed to the loudest cries.  HIV, they said.  Family planning, left to wither.

            "The Victorians, they liked their stories ornate, all lace and velvet, fixated on those who wore crowns and held silver. But there were whispers in the shadows, tales that strayed from the gilded path. *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, they ain't your mama's tea party reads.  A darkness bleeds through their pages, a touch of the uncanny, a strangeness that claws at the edges of propriety.  It's in these shadows that the characters find their truth, their motivations laid bare, their souls exposed.\n\n\"And now, a swarm of thoughts, dark and tangled, filled his mind. He walked between Sikes and Crackit, their voices a venomous hiss, their words like stones in his ears. He tried to pull himself free, but found he was speaking to them, caught in their web.  A sudden crack, a flash of fire, a scream ripped through the air. Lights danced before his eyes, a maelstrom of sound and chaos, and then he was gone, carried away by unseen hands.  Through the haze, a gnawing pain, a constant ache, a torment that wouldn't let him be.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese two tales, they play with the edges of reality, with dreams and visions that twist the familiar into something unsettling. *Oliver Twist*, it peels back Oliver's layers, revealing the scars beneath, the pain that gnaws at his heart. When the bullet finally finds its mark, in a chapter marked 28, it's not just a wound, it's a re-living of the nightmare, a dream where he's trapped in the echo of the shot. He's adrift, numbed, unable to fight, his senses dulled, a puppet in the hands of fate.  Was it Sikes? Crackit? Or was it something more, something that lurked in the shadows, something that had a hand in his suffering?  The question hangs heavy, a weight on his soul.  Oliver, he's broken, stripped bare by the world's cruelty, a hollow shell of a boy, his spirit crushed under the heel of despair.\n\n\n\"The day bled into night, a fleeting shadow, a stretch of emptiness.

            "A couple years back I was workin' in one of them after school programs, tutorin' young'uns. Elementary school, mostly. Tried to lend a hand wherever it was needed, but my head was always in the books, knowin' my way around English and readin' like a cat in a yarn shop. One of the teachers, he asked me about this kid, Adrian. Third grade, maybe fourth, couldn't make heads or tails of readin'. Seemed like somethin' was off, the way he handled words. Some he'd stumble through, others he'd spit out clean. It was a puzzle. Latino kid, I figured, though he spoke English like a native. We fumbled along for a spell, until one day the boy's mama walked in. She didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish. I was barely learnin' the lingo myself, but we managed a kind of broken conversation. And then it hit me like a bolt from the blue. Adrian, he could read just fine. The problem wasn't readin', it was the alphabet. He didn't know the letters like the back of his hand. Don't know if that realization did him much good, but I hope he's doin' alright.\n\nI tell this story 'cause it's a reminder about the wall that language builds. Here in California, especially, you see it everywhere. It ain't always as plain as day, though. A kid speaks perfect English, but readin' it can be a mountain to climb.  Everybody knows the problem exists, so what's the answer? For Adrian, it was simple enough. Tutorin', pointin' out the letters, lettin' him hear 'em spoken. But for kids who barely speak a word, it's a whole different beast. Ain't no single solution. Dual language, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of it's a magic bullet. You gotta mix and match, find the right combination for each child.\n\nDual language programs, they're a good start, a damn good start. Not just for Spanish speakers, but for all the kids. Studies show they learn better, outperform their classmates. Some folks get scared, say it's a waste of time, money, that it won't help the majority. But that's a lie. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, every kid would benefit. Now, should we make every teacher bilingual? No. That's just plain crazy. But there's no reason we can't have folks, helpers, tutors, whatever you call 'em, who speak both languages.",
            "From the cradle we are told there's a vastness out there, a thing beyond reckoning. Some are sent to pews and synagogues, others to the silence of their own minds. Many take the faith laid upon them, inherited like a coat too big. But some, they cast it off, eyes fixed on the self, a universe contained.  Values shift like desert sands.  We wander, then, each a pilgrim in the wasteland of belief, searching for a spark in the dark, a beacon against the cold.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, the word hanging in the smoke of our cigarettes. We sat on the porch, rain drumming a slow rhythm on the tin roof, drowning the thirsty plants at the edge. He looked out at the storm, eyes half-lost, half-remembering.  He'd thinned, the clothes hanging loose on his frame. His hair, what was left of it, was thin as winter wheat. He avoided my gaze, staring into the rain-soaked night. I felt a cold knot in my gut, fear and a silence too vast to speak. To say the words would make it real, a truth we both feared. So I held him, drew close, and watched the rain fall with him, the twilight a shroud upon the world.\n\nHe died in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The treatments, they bought him time, but not peace. An echo of what God had wrought, I thought, to prolong the suffering. Alone in the dark, I offered no prayers. If there was a God, he'd ceased to hear me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to watch him leave, the life that birthed me slip away. I wouldn't be a witness to his death. I'd remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone, better than his own kin. He wouldn't want me there, a silent specter at his end. I curled in my bed, a shadow in a shadowed room, waiting for the news.\n\nBut the news never came.",
            "The Gothic, a word that tasted of dust and stone, was an oxymoron, Watt said, a marriage of the old and new.  Praised and damned, it wore the mantle of the sublime, a terrible beauty that sent shivers down the spine.  Walpole, the one who birthed this beast, in his *Castle of Otranto,*  stitched together the threads of ancient romances and the nascent form of the novel, a newfangled thing that peered into the heart of man. He borrowed the ghosts of the theatre, the shadows of medieval times, and draped them across the landscape of the modern. A Gothic Story, he called it, a tale spun from the remnants of a forgotten age.\n\nGothic, you see, was a word that clung to everything and nothing. It meant old worlds and new, a jumble of styles and eras, all seen through the lens of a time that judged it archaic, a relic of a bygone barbarity. Yet, it was in this very incongruity, this clash of the timeless and the transient, that the Gothic found its power. It offered a glimpse into the darkness within, a reflection of the fears that lurked beneath the veneer of progress.\n\nOne of its most potent weapons was chivalry, a chimera of valor and honor, a code of conduct that had once defined the knights of old. In Walpole's hands, it became a symbol of a lost innocence, a yearning for a time when men were men and virtue reigned.  Frederic, the prince in *Otranto,* was a tapestry woven from these threads. \n\nThe description of him, a prince bereaved, a knight-errant marked by tragedy, was steeped in the language of chivalry. He was the epitome of the gallant knight, larger than life, a shadow cast from a fading ideal.  This exaggeration, this hint of excess, would become a hallmark of the Gothic, a way of pushing the boundaries of reality and exploring the darker recesses of the human soul.  Walpole, a man wrestling with the turmoil of his own times, may have seen in chivalry a reflection of a lost world, a world he believed had been consumed by the encroaching darkness of modernity.",
            "The flow of things. From want to want. Raw bone to bone, through the factory's maw and out onto the waiting shelves. That's what they call it, supply chain management. A word coined in 1982 by a man named Oliver, a consultant of sorts. He saw the whole thing, the planning and pulling, the push and shove of it all, the aim to satisfy the hunger in the belly of the consumer, quick and clean. Six pieces to the puzzle, he said. Production, supply, the holding of goods, the placement, the carrying, and the knowledge. Six things a man has to hold in his hand to serve the customer.\n\nProduction, the heart of it. The fire and the forge. The knowing of what the people want, what gnaws at their insides. The market, that's where you look. The market tells the tale. Demand, they call it. Once you know the thirst, you know what must be made, how much must be forged. Where the work is done, that's the next question.  The right place, the right hands. You consider the needs, the wants, and the satisfaction. And then the schedule, the rhythm of the work, the keeping of the tools. Every detail a thread in the web. A broken thread, a wasted stitch, and the whole thing unravels. I've seen it. In the aisles of Wal-Mart, Target, the endless rows. Each step, a book, a pattern, a ritual. No room for error.\n\nSupply, the next piece. The gathering of what's needed. The making of choices, the choosing of partners, the deciding of what stays in-house and what goes out. A single product, many parts, many hands. You must align the pieces. Some things stay close, others go far. Outsourcing, they call it. To make things move faster, cheaper, to keep the costs low. To find the speed, the flexibility, the agility.",

A fleeting moment of hope. But hope, like a candle in the wind, is easily extinguished.

One, a man named Nagai, fell beneath the jackboots, his camera a testament to the world's indifference.\n\nThirteen they said. Thirteen souls lost. But a voice whispered in the dark, a soldier turned defector, spoke of a different number, a thousandfold toll. The blood ran deep, staining the earth crimson.\n\nThis is the way of things. Power, a hunger that devours all in its path. From Rome's Caesars to the emperors of the rising sun, the urge to control, to bend the world to its will, has haunted mankind.  And now, in this land, this shadow-drenched corner of the world, history repeats its cruel dance.\n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of souls rising against the iron fist.  Two hundred, three hundred, or two thousand, three thousand? The numbers blur, lost in the haze of official lies.\n\nRwanda, a nation torn asunder, where brother turned against brother, fueled by hate and whispers of ancient grudges.  And the echoes of a different horror, the Third Reich, a name that still chills the blood, a testament to the depths of human cruelty.\n\nThe world watches, turns away. The whispers fade.",
            "Duke Ellington's shadow stretches long across the jazz landscape.  His time, his presence, shaped the sound of the orchestra, a band of voices given form. The piano itself, his own hand on the keys, is often muted, a whisper against the thrum of the music. But as a composer, he wove intricate tapestries, each thread a solo, each note a brushstroke on the canvas of sound. He built frameworks for flight, for improvisation, but also penned tight, interwoven passages, calling on the individual souls of his musicians to bring forth light and shadow, to reveal the heart of the music.  He shaped the tone, the texture, the very soul of the ensemble, coaxing from them a sound both coherent and wildly original.  This mastery, this understanding of the voices within the whole, allowed him to birth some of the most singular and breathtaking pieces that jazz has ever known.\n\nThe Grove's dusty pages speak of his sound, his innovation. They point to \"Creole Love Call,\" where the voice itself becomes an instrument, stripped bare of words, a raw and vibrant thread woven through the fabric.  In this early work, he shows a knack for complementing the players, a skill that defines his legacy. This slow, deliberate blues, a twelve-bar lament, unfolds in six distinct choruses:\n\n* Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reed, the voice flowing smooth at first, then hardening, turning rough at the edge.\n\n* Chorus 2: The muted trumpet, a whisper of brass, elaborates on the melody, stretching out the blues notes, savoring their ache.\n\n* Chorus 3: The clarinet soars, a high-pitched cry, backed by the piano's subtle, syncopated pulse.\n\n* Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, a dialogue between brass and reeds, a conversation in sound.\n\n* Chorus 5: The climax, a surge of sound. The reeds now take the call, their voices high and insistent, driven by the brass and rhythm sections, a syncopated stop-time heartbeat.\n\n* Chorus 6: A return to the first chorus, voice and reeds in conversation again. This time, the voice adopts the growl, a raw, primal sound, a soloing instrument.\n\nA brief tag, a vocal run, a dissonant trombone note, a jarring end.\n\nThe voice, a color in the music's palette, a texture woven into the sound, this is a thread that runs through his work, a hallmark of Ellington's artistry. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" a year later, he marries his tight orchestration with his ear for color.  \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing exchange a call and response. Miley's trumpet becomes vocal, Cox's voice an instrument, and together they create a rich and vibrant sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" takes this further, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She'd always felt a hunger in her, a wanting that gnawed at the edges of her soul. It started when she was fourteen, coming into that strange bloom of girlhood. Now, three years on, at seventeen, the hunger remained, though sharpened, focused. It wasn't for things anymore. No, it was for a person. Someone to fill the hollow. But boys, they meant nothing to her. Some had tried, clumsy and earnest, to court her, but none had stirred a flicker. She'd wrestle with the strangeness of it, searching for an answer in the dark corners of her mind. Theories had formed and withered, leaving her with a gnawing emptiness. So she lived, adrift in a sea of questions.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, a stillness like the dust motes dancing in a sunbeam. Her parents, good and simple folk, spoke in low tones, their lives a gentle rhythm. Arguments were rare, a storm cloud passing quickly over a calm sky. The only discord came from her own restless spirit, her yearning for independence a thorn in their contentment.  They were the quiet kind, she, a whirlwind of laughter and energy, a spark against their calm.\n\nBut this day, the stillness was broken. A sharp cry sliced through the house, her mother's voice, clear and panicked, echoing from the kitchen. She raced in, her heart hammering against her ribs. \"Mom? What is it?\"\n\nHer mother lay sprawled on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Ow,\" she gasped, each breath a ragged shard of sound. The girl knelt beside her, fear a cold knot in her stomach. \"Mom, what happened? Where does it hurt?\"\n\n\"Sweetie,\" her mother choked out, \"Need... hospital.\"\n\nThe words were squeezed from her, a desperate plea. Her daughter, her heart a drumbeat against her ribs, knew the gravity of the situation. \"Alright, Mom, I'm taking you. Where should I drive?\"\n\nHer mother pointed, her hand trembling, and the girl, her muscles burning with a sudden strength, lifted her mother, her own fear a distant echo. \n\nThe hospital, a place of sterile smells and hushed anxieties, blurred past in a rush of urgency. The girl, her face set in grim determination, carried her mother through the doors, her voice ringing out, \"Help! We need a doctor!\"\n\nThe girl watched, her heart a tight fist, as doctors swarmed around her mother, their faces grave. They whisked her away on a gurney, leaving the girl alone with her fear, the silence heavy with worry.\n\nLater, the doctor explained. A fall. A misplaced stepstool. A vase. An accident.",
            "The study aimed to sift the truth from the dust, to see if a way of eating, the so-called Mediterranean Diet, could hold back the tide of heart disease and stroke. They called it the aMed diet, a kind of reckoning with the old ways, more plants and beans, less of the flesh and fat. Fish, olive oil, and a measured pour of wine were allowed, but the sugar and the red meat, they were to be kept at bay.\n\nOld studies had seen whispers of this, a link between the Med diet and a longer life, a quieter heart. But this new study dug deeper, wanting to know about the silent killers, the strokes that took lives in the night.\n\nThey followed women, 74,886 of them, nurses bound by duty and a shared hunger for knowledge. For twenty years, they filled out their food journals, recounting the meals, the bites, the sips. The researchers, like vultures circling, scrutinized their words, hunting for patterns, for the telltale signs of a life well-lived, or ill-lived. \n\nThey looked for heart attacks, for strokes, for the cold hand of death. They accounted for every factor, every habit, every vice. Age, smoking, weight, the pills they swallowed, the sun they basked in. They stripped away the layers, seeking the truth beneath. \n\nAnd what did they find?  The women who ate like the ancient Greeks, they lived longer.  Their hearts beat steady, their strokes fewer. A higher score on the aMed scale, a closer walk with the olive oil and the beans, meant a lower risk of dying young, of falling victim to the darkness.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, a house of cards built on sand, began to tremble. Unemployment crept like a shadow across the land. Homes, once symbols of security, stood empty, their windows vacant eyes staring into the abyss. Corporations, giants of steel and glass, crumbled like dust. The sickness spread, a contagion of bad blood infecting the very soul of the nation. How did it come to this?  \n\nThe architects of this ruin, those who held the reins of power, had dealt in hubris and folly. They had pressed banks and men of commerce to peddle subprime loans, seeds of destruction sown in an already fragile soil. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those pillars of the financial order, were compelled to weave a tapestry of mortgages, threads of risk spun into CDOs and CDSs, a house of mirrors reflecting a distorted reality. When the music stopped, the borrowers defaulted. The banks, stripped bare, passed the contagion on, infecting the body politic.\n\nThe roots of this rot ran deep, back to the Clinton years, a time of prosperity that masked the simmering discontent. The President, seeking to extend his own reign, loosened the reins of regulation, a dangerous gamble that would have dire consequences. The whispers of warning went unheeded.  Steven Holmes, a chronicler of the times, saw the coming storm. He wrote of Fannie Mae's pressure to expand its reach, to lend to those who could not repay, and foretold the government's inevitable intervention.  His words, like prophets of doom, went unheeded.\n\nThe new instruments of finance, complex and arcane, only served to entangle the nation further. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs, these instruments of speculation, fueled the flames of the housing bubble. The nation, drunk on easy credit, overleveraged itself, teetering on the precipice.\n\nThe bubble burst, a deafening cataclysm that shook the foundations of the world. The financial institutions, those who had bet on the rise, were left holding the bag. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, titans brought low. Lehman Brothers, dismantled, a monument to hubris. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, forced to abandon their reckless ways, transformed into creatures of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, drowning in debt, were placed under the government's control.\n\nThe wounds of this crisis are still raw, a reminder of the fragility of prosperity, the seductive allure of risk, and the consequences of unchecked ambition.",
            "Exposition. A barren plain where the writer's words stretch thin, a whimper in the wind. Or worse, a raincloud, heavy with too much telling and too little showing, blotting out the sun of the story. Dr. Merlin, she's known to spit on the keyboard when she catches herself drowning in it. Not the kind of drowning that's fun, neither. \n\nYou know the rule. Show, don't tell. But even the best of us stumble, caught in the snare of too much information. The devil on your shoulder whispers, 'Get it over with,' urges you to lay bare the past, to spill the beans, to carve the history into every line. But that's not storytelling. That's a lecture.\n\nThink of it like this: a film, the characters trading barbs, spitting out facts like seeds from a cracked gourd. A dump of details, a torrent. In fiction, it's the writer doing the talking, the narrator filling in the blanks, laying down the foundation with words that stick like glue.\n\nTake this: a story, a heroine, a lover lost. They meet, they marry, he dies.  Two pages spent on a life's sum, the words flat as cardboard, the characters hollow.  Where's the depth? Where's the ache of loss?\n\nShow me the man, the husband. Let his words sing, let his eyes reflect the love he holds. Show me the woman, how his presence shaped her, how her world bloomed under his sun. Show me the bond, the fragile thread that binds them, and then show me the jagged break. \n\nOnly then can you make them real. Only then can you make me feel.\n\nAnd that, my friend, is the heart of storytelling.",
            "The television hummed, the light from the screen a sickly yellow in the dim room. Two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio, flickered across the screen. The first, NBC 4, live this morning, August the thirteenth, 2011. The lead story, a man, Shad Hostettler, a name like a bad wound, had stabbed his wife in Ashley.  They didn't name her. They showed his mug shot, an image of pure malice, and then moved on after two minutes. Multiple stabbings, they said, arrested. The details were thin, like smoke.\n\nThe next story, a younger man, Travis Buyers, eighteen years, shot in Sharon Woods, critically injured. No arrests, no suspects, only the echo of gunfire and the silent tread of the SWAT team. A quick glimpse, a fleeting shadow, as if the boy's fate mattered less.  It was the color of his skin, I thought, the shade of his neighborhood, that dimmed the light on this story.  Years I've watched this play out, a silent script of prejudice. A white child missing, a white man wronged, and the news would explode. A black boy shot, a black woman gone, and the sound is barely a whisper.\n\nThe helicopter, a Med-Flight, had been struck. A .22 caliber bullet, a whisper of violence against the sky. A five thousand dollar reward for information, a meager plea against the darkness.\n\nThe weatherman, a pale ghost against the green grass of a screen, spoke of thunderstorms and rain. The weekend, he said, mid-eighties. A tease, a promise of fleeting reprieve.\n\nA robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, they said, a hoodie pulled low, six feet tall, one hundred and fifty pounds.  They lingered on his blackness, as if it were the only detail worth knowing.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a drug kingpin from Texas, a name that tasted like dust and betrayal. He had conspired to bring marijuana into Ohio, they said, sentenced to three hundred months, a number that felt heavier, colder than twenty-five years. A Hispanic man, they noted, as if the color of his skin held some weight in the matter.",
            "The blood is thick. The tie that binds brothers, it cuts deep. It runs with love, yes, but with pride too. And jealousy.  And a cruelty that hides in the dark places.  Brothers see themselves in each other, clearer than any mirror.  The truth of that bond, it flares brightest in the firelight of hardship.   And it comes with a price. To understand the heart of brotherhood is to understand the weight of that price. To look into the eyes of your brother and see your own reflection, that's not the way the world sees you, no. That's the way you truly are. The deeds you do, the blood spilled, that's where the soul is laid bare.  \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk this path, across a landscape thick with green and shadow. Their journey, it's a fool's errand. The bitter sting of disappointment clashes with the iron grip of pride. Only one of them finds the strength to walk away. The story, it unfolds through the eyes of the boy who walks alone. The weight of his brother's burden, the weight of his own heart, it all spills out.\n\nPride, it's the engine that drives him. From their first clumsy steps together to their final, fateful climb, the boy is haunted by resentment. He yearned for a brother to teach, to share in the wildness of his own spirit. A brother to race with, to climb with, to share the secrets of the swamp. But Doodle, his brother, he was born frail, a bird with clipped wings. \n\nThe boy, he dreams of a different kind of brother. A brother who could keep pace, who could laugh in the face of danger. But Doodle, he's just a shadow, a fragile thing. The boy's dreams, they turn to dust. He even thinks, for a moment, of silencing Doodle forever.  But the boy, he hesitates. A small smile, a flicker of light in those fragile eyes, and the boy's heart, it softens.  The darkness recedes. But the seeds of pride, they remain.",
            "The human skull, a fortress of bone, houses a labyrinth of thought. A machine of flesh and fire, the mind has been likened to parchment, to ledger, to clockwork. Each metaphor a pale ghost of the reality within. The brain, a dark star, burns with its own light, a fire born of signal and echo.\n\nThe senses, tendrils reaching out, grasp the world. Touch, heat, sound, light - all transformed into whispers, into the language of the nerve. The brain, a tireless weaver, spins these whispers into meaning. Up from the raw material, bottom-up, the strands are bound, a picture taking shape. But the mind, a master of deception, knows more than the sum of its parts. Top-down, it reaches, guiding the strands, shaping the vision. A box, or a void? The brain decides.\n\nA gatekeeper stands, a vigilant censor. Attention, a flickering flame, illuminates the path, guiding the flow. A thousand blades of grass, a million whispers, drowned out. Yet a name, a whispered word, a beacon in the dark, cuts through the noise.\n\nMemory, a fractured mirror, holds the past. Sensory, fleeting; working, a brief flicker; long-term, a vast, silent archive. Information, encoded, stored, woven into the fabric of being. Some whisper of electrical currents, of looping signals. Others speak of proteins, of structures etched in the very essence of the mind.\n\nBut how is knowledge organized? A web, a map, a tangled forest? The mind, a closed book, its secrets yet to be revealed.",
            "The desert wind howled through the steel canyons of Huxley's Brave New World. A sun bleached landscape of conformity, its people were husks, programmed for pleasure and obedience. Their lives, a hymn to the machine, a testament to the siren song of capital. Aldous saw the coming darkness, the iron fist of technology encased in the gilded glove of progress. Community, they called it. A gilded cage where the individual withered, sacrificed on the altar of instant gratification.\n\nHe saw the World Controllers, their eyes cold and calculating, weaving the fabric of this dystopia.  Marx's ghost whispered in his ear, a specter of alienation and reification.  Homogeneity, the enemy of the soul, spread like a plague.  Huxley, the prophet, saw the proletariat, not in the factories of his time, but in the shallow eyes of the Deltas and Gammas.  Their desires, manufactured, their dreams, hollow echoes of a forgotten humanity.\n\nFalse consciousness, the Marxist specter, gripped them tight.  They were blind to the true relations of their world, their appetites stoked by the flickering screens of the World State.  Consume, they whispered.  Obey.  Be content.  The Alpha, the Beta, they knew better.  But their knowledge was a cold fire, a useless ember in the face of the machine.  They too were trapped, complicit in the system's slow, creeping decay.\n\nLove, a forgotten word, a relic of a time before.  Theirs was a world of shallow glances, of fleeting desires, of bodies fleetingly touched.  The human soul, starved of connection, withered in the sterile air.  The social order, a pyramid of oppression, stood firm.  \n\nHuxley's Brave New World was a warning, a stark reflection of a future not yet written.  A future where the machine devoured the soul and the individual, leaving only a hollow shell in its wake.",
            "The sun wore low in the sky above the sprawl of University Park. Two and a half years. That's how long I'd walked these cracked pavements, these endless quadrants of brick and mortar.  Four and a half semesters.  East Halls. They called it a dorm, but it might as well have been a outpost on the edge of some forgotten frontier. The wind whipped off the fields, carrying the ghost of autumn and the echo of distant football cheers.  My freshman year, that's where they sent me. A stone's throw from the stadium, a world away from Willard, that nexus of commerce and knowledge.  Twenty minutes, maybe more, to traverse the distance on foot.  The weather, a fickle mistress, often laid waste to the journey. Rain, snow, sleet. They all conspired to turn the asphalt into a slick, treacherous ribbon.  An old boy, not much older than myself, told me tales of a time when East Halls stood alone, surrounded by acres of vacant land. Now, that wasteland was a testament to progress. Fields of green, concrete leviathans like the Creamery and the new health center, and apartment blocks reaching for the sky. The campus, a beast in perpetual motion, was consuming itself, growing ever more sprawling, ever more disjointed. How to navigate this labyrinth?\n\nA friend, a fellow traveler on two wheels, had returned to the bike after a long absence. \"Why did I ever stop?\" he'd mused. \"Bikes are the answer,\" he'd said, his voice rough with conviction. \"It's the only way.\"  More than just a means of transport, the bicycle was a philosophy. A rebellion against the tyranny of cars and buses.  A commitment to efficiency, to freedom. A bowl of oatmeal and a few pedal strokes, and the miles would melt away.  \n\nI, too, had made the change.  Living off-campus now, just as distant from the heart of the university as some of those dorms, I'd bought a bike.  It was the smartest decision I'd made. My classes were in Thomas building, a quarter-hour walk at the very least. But on two wheels, it became a mere five minutes, a blur of motion.  Pollock Road, the artery connecting me to the university, was a hard road to travel. Not for the faint of heart.  Walking, I knew, was a virtue, but time, a commodity more precious than gold, was a luxury I couldn't afford.  Without the bike, I'd be tethered to the sidewalks,  another cog in the slow, grinding machine of the university.  Two and a half hours a week. That's what walking to Thomas building would cost me.  And that was just one class. Multiply that by all the others, all the appointments, all the errands, and the hours would bleed away, swallowed by the insatiable maw of time."
