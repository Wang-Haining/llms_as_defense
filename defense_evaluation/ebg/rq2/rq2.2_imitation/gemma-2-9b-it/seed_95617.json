            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The work they called social work called to me. Helping the lost children, the broken families. That's where I saw myself, in the Division of Family and Children Services. A life dedicated to service, respect, and the hard-won ethics of the trade. To mend the frayed edges of families, to offer a hand to those in need. These weren't just words, these were the things that lived inside me.\n\nI'd always felt a pull towards helping, but the path was obscured. High school, college, a parade of faces running from their troubles, or clinging to crutches that wouldn't hold. I watched it all unfold, and that's how I found myself with a degree in Psychology, still searching.\n\nA summer lay ahead, a time for rest, for reflection. A friend's house, a boy sitting stiffly on the couch, his eyes wide with fear. Sixteen years old, escaping the storm of his home. Abusive parents, he said. The next day, the police were called. I felt a pull, a need to do something. I drove to the house, spoke to the officers, offered what little knowledge my degree had given me. They asked me to speak to the parents. \n\nTheir faces were tight, their words a tangled web of excuses. \"Manipulative,\" they called their son, for seeking help. \"Simple disputes,\" they said, as if the boy's terror was some childish game. That day, I knew. This wasn't just a career, it was a calling.\n\nSocial justice, another cornerstone. We talk of individual worth, but what does it mean? We mourn the lost, yet strive to be the same. I don't want to be a shadow, a reflection. I've always fought against the mold, against the quiet conformity. My hair a riot of color, my clothes a statement, piercings piercing the accepted norms. A voice for the voiceless, a protector of the marginalized. I've marched, I've spoken, I've challenged the status quo. This is who I am, and this is what I will continue to fight for.",
            "The paper here takes up the tangled threads of insomnia, weaving them through the looms of biology and society. The biological strand speaks of inheritable codes, of the body's own machinery gone awry. It probes the depths of genes and the hum of neurons, tracing the pathways of sleep and wakefulness through the labyrinthine brain. The sociocultural thread, it delves into the world outside, the web of circumstance that shapes our nights. It considers the weight of race and class, the echoes of history and the burdens of place. \n\nThis examination, it seeks to unravel the mysteries of insomnia through the lens of these two models, to illuminate the interplay between nature and nurture. It sifts through the evidence, the shards of research, to decipher the strengths and weaknesses of each claim. \n\nInsomnia, it can be a shadow cast by itself, or a specter accompanying other maladies of the mind. It can be a whisper in the night, a phantom limb, or a roaring beast. It can be a primary disorder, a dyssomnia, or a parasomnia, a disruption of the natural rhythms of sleep. It can be a consequence of medical strife or the ghosts of substances past.\n\nThe biological model, it delves into the very essence of the sleepless soul. It points to the hypothalamus, the conductor of our inner orchestra, and its conductor's baton, the orexin neurons. It speaks of receptors, GABAB in particular, that whisper secrets of sleep and wakefulness. It reveals how these receptors, when activated or silenced, can summon slumber or banish it.\n\nA study, it reveals,  probing the depths of the mouse brain, uncovers the presence of GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons.  This activation, it suggests, can usher in the embrace of sleep. But a disruption, a glitch in this delicate dance, can leave one tossing and turning, a prisoner in the cage of wakefulness.\n\nThis, it warns, is not merely a tale of mice, but a reflection of our own biological tapestry. If these receptors, these tiny architects of sleep, are indeed shaped by our genes, then the seeds of insomnia can be planted long before the first sleepless night.\n\nThe sociocultural model, it lifts its gaze from the microscopic to the vast expanse of human experience. It recognizes that sleep is not a solitary affair, but a dance woven into the fabric of our lives. It acknowledges the influence of race, class, and the invisible hand of history.\n\nIf the biological model speaks of genes and neurons, the sociocultural model speaks of the world that shapes us. It recognizes that poverty, stress, and trauma can cast long shadows over our nights. It understands that the burden of inequality can manifest in sleepless nights.",

Then, the matter of diagnosis, the signs, the whispers in the dark. And finally, a glimpse into the ways a teacher in a classroom, a world of noise and clamor, might help a child lost in the sound. \n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, they call it. Auditory Processing Disorder too. It speaks to the way the brain, the hard-wired machinery of the mind, makes use of what it hears. A matter of efficiency, of effectiveness. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, they say it's \"the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing.\" The brain, they say, failing to translate the sounds, to sift the words from the hum. A child who hears, yet cannot understand. Not deaf, but adrift in a sea of sound. The brain, they say, doesn't work right.\n\nThey first spoke of this disorder in the fifties, \"auditory imperception\" they called it. Researchers, poking and probing at children with speech troubles. Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari, in Italy, they began to fashion tests.

A child may not hear sounds in space, may struggle to tell one sound from another, may miss the patterns, the whispers in the wind. Sarcasm, a change in tone, it passes them by. One sound drowned out by the next.  The world a jumbled mess.  \n\nDiagnosis is a careful dance. Observation, tests, a hunt for the signs. Audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, they all play a part. Questionnaires, tests with sounds, a symphony of stimuli. No single test, no magic bullet. The cause, a mystery.",

What drives a woman to don the mask of a man, to become a phantom in a foreign land? In Viola's case, it's the cold grip of survival. She seeks shelter in the guise of a man, a shield against the darkness.\n\nBut this protection comes at a price. She is cut off from the wellspring of her own kind, adrift in a sea of unfamiliar faces. And the lie takes root, twisting and blooming into something unforeseen. Olivia, blinded by the illusion, falls for her charade, mistaking the man for a man. \n\nAnd Orsino, he too, is caught in the web. A love unspoken, a yearning for something beyond reach, fueled by the masquerade. But is it the man that Olivia desires, or something deeper, a hidden truth she cannot name?  Perhaps, in the shadow play of Twelfth Night, Shakespeare shows us the way our own desires can be shaped by the masks we wear. He reveals the fragility of truth, the way it can be both a source of pain and a catalyst for understanding.\n\nOlivia, she moves quickly from one illusion to another, a fickle heart swayed by appearances.  In the end, she sees Viola not as a lover, but as a sister, a bond forged in the crucible of deception.  And so, the play leaves us with a question: what are we willing to sacrifice for love, for truth, for a semblance of self?",
            "The stain of the Reich stretched long and dark across the African sun.  The slaughter of the Ovaherero and Nama, a reckoning etched in blood, stood as a testament to the brutality of their rule.  But empires, like men, are not simple beasts.  The German dominion, sprawled across the continent, wore many faces.  Its policies, like the shifting sands, varied with the winds of place. Education, a flickering candle in the vast darkness, burned with different intensities in each.\n\nWhen the British came, inheriting the husk of German East Africa, they found a people touched by knowledge, literate souls walking in the sun.  In Kamerun, and other shadowed corners of the empire, whispers spoke of the Germans' efforts, their attempts to bring light to the darkness.  But in South West Africa, a different tale unfolded.  A land where the government, with a cold indifference, left the fate of native education to the meager ministrations of missionaries.  \n\nEuropeans, the favored sons, were ushered into the halls of learning, their education nurtured and controlled by the state's iron hand.  The natives, however, remained shrouded in ignorance, the vast majority untouched by the glow of knowledge.  This disparity, a scar upon the land, lingered long after the Reich had crumbled. Other colonies boasted a people awakened, literate and empowered. South West Africa, however, remained trapped in the grip of darkness.\n\nThis paper seeks to unravel the threads that bind this history, to shed light upon the reasons for this divergence.  It delves into the attitudes of the settlers, the whispers of the colonial authorities, and the social, political, and economic forces that shaped the destiny of a people.\n\nThe study of German colonial education is a vast and intricate tapestry, woven from primary sources in the German tongue, penned in the twilight of the empire.  These early works sought to document the shape of education in the colonies, to illuminate the workings of a system both complex and contradictory.  Later writings, in the English tongue, expanded the discourse, comparing the educational landscapes of the various colonies and dissecting the nuances of their practices.  Cohen, in his seminal work, cast a critical eye upon the educational systems of both South West Africa and East Africa, drawing a stark contrast.  He argues that the settler population, a tide of white desires, shaped the distinct features of South West Africa's educational system.\n\n\nThe land itself, a canvas of arid desert and temperate plains, offered a relative respite from the scorching heat of other colonies. This, in turn, attracted a steady influx of European settlers, swelling their numbers to nearly fifteen thousand by 1913.  In East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population, the numbers paled in comparison, a mere five thousand souls.",
            "The classification of Popular Music, a tangled web spun over a century, now encompasses a multitude of genres so numerous they defy easy listing. Each, from rap to rock, country to jazz, folk and beyond, gives birth to subgenres and sub-subgenres, a sprawling, ever-branching family tree.  Heavy metal, a child of rock, has emerged in the past forty years as a genre of remarkable diversity and expression. Its music, a tempest of sound, channels a spectrum of emotions, though often veering toward the shadowed recesses of the human heart. \n\nFrom its nascent days, metal's flexibility was evident. Bands, drawn to its power, began carving out their own niches, spawning subgenres in turn, each a reflection of its own particular vision. And so the chain continues, a labyrinth of sound where the boundaries blur, and the question arises: what, precisely, is heavy metal?\n\nIt has become a chameleon, absorbing elements from other genres, yet its origins remain a vital touchstone. To truly understand the metal that reverberates today, one must first trace its lineage, for it is more than a mere genre—it is a movement, a force that has reshaped the landscape of music.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a child of darkness. A \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more raw power, more theatricality. Less innocence, more virtuosity. The musicians, masters of their instruments, wield their craft with a precision that pierces the soul.\n\nAnd there's a darkness that seeps into its very core, a darkness born of the psychedelic drug boom of the mid-seventies, a time when minds expanded and boundaries blurred.  The music, infused with the otherworldly, became a conduit for the experiences, both joyful and terrifying, that these substances wrought. Metal's visceral qualities, a stark departure from the prevailing pop music of the era, tapped into a primal wellspring of emotion, echoing the dark, brooding themes of the Romantic era.\n\nLyrics, sharp as daggers, capture this essence:\n\n\nThese words, from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" expose the darker side of the Fab Four. A song of highs and lows, a reflection of the drug-induced haze, it is considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response, a challenge, to the Rolling Stones' own foray into heavier, darker territory. The Beatles, proving they could match the Stones' intensity, unleashed this sonic beast upon the world in their iconic \"White Album.\"",
            "The Surrealists were yet to come, their canvases bleeding with dreams. But long before, Henri Rousseau, alone in his studio, was crafting his own. Not just on canvas, but in the marrow of his bones. The Dream, 1910. A woman, eyes wide, bathed in the light of some strange, inner world.  And Rousseau himself, trapped in the labyrinth of his own striving. \n\nRecognition. Acceptance. The whisper of praise from those who knew the language of paint. A hunger gnawed at him, a yearning to be seen. But the world of art, cold and unforgiving, demanded conformity. To sculpt his dreams into the mold of expectation, or to stand apart, a lone figure in a howling wilderness? \n\nThis was the battle raging within him, a battle painted across the years. \n\nRousseau, born in the small town of Laval, was no child of privilege. His father, a tinsmith, his world a hard-scrabble existence.  No lessons in the academies, no gilded whispers of patronage. He toiled as a toll collector, a gabelou, his days measured out in the rhythm of passing carts and coins. Then, a cruel blow: the deaths of his wife and eight children, leaving only a daughter, Julia, to bind him to the world. He sought solace in paint, a language he learned by heart, a refuge from the ache in his soul.\n\nHe wasn't like the others, the artists who romanticized the peasant, the simple folk. He was one of them, his dreams as rooted in the soil as the wheat fields that stretched beyond his window. He knew the hunger, the yearning for something more than the daily grind. \n\nAnd so, he painted.\n\nBut the world of art, a jungle of talent and ambition, offered little comfort. Matisse rose, a comet streaking across the sky, while Rousseau remained in the shadows. He longed to be seen, to be welcomed into the fold, to be more than just a douanier with a brush.\n\n\"Matisse feared the trite,\" wrote Jan Gordon, \"while Rousseau desired the conventional, the accepted,\" a desperate yearning to be deemed worthy.",
            "The men of thought, they've pondered it long. This thing, this kinship between the right and the beautiful. Between truth and the eye's delight. Keats, he knew it, said it plain. \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—\" That's all you know on this earth, and all you need to know.\n\nWe learn, we're taught. Facts and figures, how to live in this world. But ethics, aesthetics, these things they seep into you. Not through lessons, but through the marrow. Like a wind that blows through the trees, shaping them, whispering secrets.  \n\nWe study art, we dissect it. We weigh morality, try to pin it down. But it's a slippery thing. Like smoke, it eludes our grasp. We talk of foreground, of shadow and light, of context. Yet these words, they fall short.  There's something else, something that lingers. A ghost in the machine, as it were.\n\nA favorite book, a piece of music that stirs the soul. We struggle to explain it. \"There's just something about it,\" we say. And it's true. There's a something that transcends the words, the brushstrokes, the notes. A hollowness, an ache, a longing.\n\nIt's the same with morals. We can lay out the rules, the dos and don'ts. But the heart, the soul, it knows a different kind of truth. A truth that can't be contained, can't be explained.\n\nLiterature, now that's a thing apart. It's the closest we come to touching this other world.  McKean, he understood it. \"Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"\n\nMorality and art, they're two sides of the same coin. They speak to us on a level deeper than words. They touch the soul, the very core of who we are.",
            "The Germany of now, a fist clenched in the world's hand. A nation forged in the shadow of the Alps, a chill wind blowing from München to the salt spray of Kiel. The same blood runs through Köln's veins on the Rhine, through the heart of the land, to Dresden, a city cradled by the Elbe. It's a tapestry woven from disparate threads, a culture spun from the whispers of tribes long gone.\n\nGermania. The name itself a ghost, a whisper echoing through the ages. Scholars, they scratch and claw at its meaning, but the truth lies buried deep. Tacitus, he claimed it belonged to the Tungrians, a people who crossed the Rhine, their swords singing a song of war against the Gauls. (Tacitus, 98.) Caesar, that butcher of men, he first used the word \"Germanus,\" a label to distinguish the conquered Gauls from those who held fast to their land. Taken from the Gauls themselves, a word meant to mark the difference, the line between victors and the vanquished. Some say it came from the Gaulish tongue, a word for neighbor, a word turned weapon. Caesar, in his own blood-soaked chronicle, writes of them: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others whisper of the spear, the \"ger,\" a weapon wielded in the heart of battle. Or perhaps from the Old Irish word, \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" a testament to their fierce voices that echoed across the plains. (Names of Germany)\n\nTacitus, his pen a scalpel dissecting history, wrote in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" a testament to the origins of these people. \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nRome, a colossus, looked upon Germania with a cold curiosity. They sought its riches, its furs, its amber. They sent their legions, their swords tasting the blood of the Germanic tribes, but Rome, in the end, turned its gaze elsewhere. The tribes, they lived on the edges, trading their wares, their skills, their blood in the ranks of the Roman legions. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "The pit yawned open below. I looked in.  Mind a blank slate, the picture etched itself there.  No emotion, no judgment. Just the cold, clear gaze of a thing seeing.  Thoughts, wisps of smoke, rose and vanished in the stillness.  The world flowed through me, a river of light and shadow. No thoughts of my own, just the current.\n\nOnce, an artist I knew, his eyes like chips of flint, told me of a book, *The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain*.  He said it taught you to see. To see the way a pencil moved, the way the world itself was made of lines.  He said to frame your vision, box it in, until all that was left was the essence. A bowl of fruit, not a kitchen, not a life.  Just the bowl.\n\nThe bowl before me now. I could not frame it.  It choked me, suffocated me.  Picasso with his blues, Monet with his greens, the Italians with their riot of colors.  This was my palette, the brown of the earth, the brown of decay.  Work in Brown, I thought.\n\nMy fingers brushed the cold porcelain. Muscles tensed, then slacked.  The will to shape, to mold, to create.  The water, a mirror of the sky, calm and deep.  A flake, a whisper, a moment of detachment.  Muscles tightened, a struggle, a spasm.  The handle slammed down.  Nothing.  A stubborn knot, a lump of defiance.\n\nMop in hand, tie a noose around my throat, I stared.  A message, scrawled in brown ink.  More flushes, more silence.  Then, the paper.  A slow, deliberate movement, wrapping, concealing.  Like a grave digger, preparing the earth.  My hand plunged in, a mother gathering her child.",
            "The young ones are dying behind the wheel.  A confluence of things, a tangle of roots, brings them to this reckoning. The Institutes, they say, the brain ain't fully formed yet.  Not ready for the reckoning of the road. And inexperience, that's the heart of it.  A raw nerve that bleeds out in fatal crashes, in vehicles rolled like dying beasts, in reckless speed and the edge of the asphalt.\n\nThey're worse, these young ones, with their kind amongst them.  A fact known to any man with a lick of sense.  The Center in California, they studied it, the age of the passenger and the accidents they brought.  A grim dance.\n\nStates, they try.  Provisional licenses, they call 'em.  Hours limited, friends kept at bay.  But these are just bandages on a gunshot wound.  The truth is, they ain't ready.  Not by the numbers. Not by the cold, hard facts.  Doctor Zuckerman, he says it plain.  Eighteen, too young.  The young ones, they crave the rush, the thrill of the edge.  It's in their blood.  Delay the wheel, he says, let the hunger fade.\n\nWe keep handing out licenses, though.  And the dead pile up.  More soon, when the boomers' children come of age. Millions of them, hungry for the road.  A reckoning waits.\n\nThe law, it ain't hard to write.  Schools, they can teach, but no hands on the wheel 'til eighteen.  A permit, maybe, and hours behind the wheel with a guide.  Six hours, fifty hours, the numbers are already there.  Across the states, a uniform law, a national shield.\n\nNot a new idea, no.  But maybe, just maybe, it's time we made it real.",
            "The Library of Congress, a monument to the dead past, housed a collection of Edison's early films. I set out to watch them all, fifteen or so, from the waning years of the century to the dawning of the new. Trick films, they were called, illusions conjured by the cut and splice of celluloid. My study leaned toward the poetics of these tricks, the common thread that wove them together, and the few that dared to break free, to stray from the path.  \n\nMostly, these early films were bound to the stage, confined within a frame as rigid as a proscenium. The camera, a silent observer, never moved. It held its ground, a drone in the eye, capturing the world in long shots, medium shots, never a close-up. The one-shot rule held true, each idea, each flicker, captured in a single, unbroken take.\n\nThe set, the stage, it was always there, a constricting presence. Figures moved side to side, like marionettes on strings, never approaching or receding, never truly leaving the frame.  Look at \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" a phantom from 1900. The actors, shadows in the gloom, step in from the right, vanish into the darkness, but the camera, unblinking, holds its gaze.\n\nThe proscenium, a cage, dictated the form. The audience, like spectators in a darkened theater, saw the whole world at once, framed by the edges of the stage.  The actors, tethered to the middle ground, never breached the boundaries. Close-up, intimacy, a foreign concept.\n\nEach film, a single idea, a single shot, told in a minute or less.  A glimpse, a trick, a vanishing act, a story whispered and gone. But be wary, for the illusion is a lie. What appears as a single shot may be many, stitched together, a tapestry woven from fragments. Look closer at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" a relic from 1895.  The severed head, a phantom flicker, a trick of the light, a joining of disparate moments.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline. A man of the soil. A farmer. And though the fields were his calling, the soil itself spoke to him of freedom, of self-reliance. A man made by the land, he saw the government then as a reflection of that land, and in his mind, the land was best left untamed, fiercely independent. He spoke of republics, of rights, of a Constitution meant to be a fence, not a cage. He believed in the nature of man, the darkness and the light, and that a government too strong would only fan those flames. He saw the dangers of a hungry power, a government swollen by ambition, and he saw the virtue in the simple life, the life of the farmer, the life lived close to the earth. The Declaration, he said, was the real testament, a whisper of sovereignty from the heart of the nation. A nation of states, not a single, monolithic whole. He wanted the government small, its reach limited, its touch light, lest it smother the very thing it sought to protect.",
            "The chart, Figure Seventeen, tells a story. A stark drop in commuter logs the third month in. A discouragement, to be sure. Why this fall? Winter's bite had settled on the New England bones. Fewer souls walking or pedaling to class. December, the semester's end, a flurry of grades and deadlines. The log, a forgotten thing in the clamor. Then the holidays, that long shadow swallowing the campus, students and faculty dispersed. January, a slow awakening, classes stirring. Still, February, the logs remained scant. \n\nPerhaps the initial spark, that first burst of interest, had faded. A natural thing, maybe. So they built a Carpool Challenge Week, a firestorm in March, to reignite the flame. It worked, the logs climbed again. But the challenge remained: to hold the light against the winter of disengagement, against the cycles of school and season.\n\nAnother challenge: the allure of the car, an ingrained hunger for freedom, for the open road. A cultural beast. To lure them away, you need bait. They offered trinkets, gift cards to coffee shops and bookstores, even massages. But what of bigger prizes? A bicycle, a sleek hybrid, a silent electric dream? Perhaps that would have kept the logs full, year-round. The prizes remained the same, a meager offering against the siren song of the engine. \n\nWhat if the prizes, like the winter sky, grew brighter? Imagine, a promise whispered in December: a bicycle, a reward for the journey ahead. Then in January, bolder still: a hybrid, a whisper of the future. Maybe then, the logs would have sung a different song.",
            "The ticker, they call it ETF, for Exchange Traded Fund. A cage, you might say, holding a collection of stocks, commodities, or even a phantom index. Like a stock, it moves on the boards, bought and sold in a flash.  But within that cage, a whole world. Diversification, they promise, spread thin against risk. Yet, a closer look reveals a price to pay. A commission for each trade, a toll to cross the threshold.\n\nThere are whispers, too, of expense ratios, lower than the old mutual funds, but still a weight on the scales. And the question lingers: does this cage truly offer the spread promised? Does owning a single ETF truly mirror the spread of a hand-picked portfolio?\n\nWe'll take IHF, a cage of its own, and examine its contents. The ten strongest holdings, they say, make up  more'n sixty percent of the cage's worth.  We'll compare these ten, these individual souls, to the cage itself. Will they sing the same song? Will their returns match the cage's, or will they offer a different tune altogether?  \n\nWe'll speak in numbers, in terms of Beta and Return, the metrics of the trade. But remember, numbers can lie.

            "Dream-land. One of Poe's own words, he called it a better poem. In it, he speaks of Thulé, a word echoed twice, like a ghost, in lines six and fifty-six. Mabbott traces it back to Virgil, the old man who wrote of an island north of Britain, a place the Greeks reckoned the world's edge. Virgil, he used it, that's for sure. But there's a newer whisper, a breath from across the sea, a German wind. Poe, he had eyes for those writers, spoke their tongue in his own way.\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his book, he lays it out plain: Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon. The echo there, Arndt says, is more than a passing fancy. Poe, he was mimicking the master.\n\nOxford, they speak of Goethe, a writer celebrated for his Faust, a play in two parts, the first born in eighteen-oh-eight, the second in the year of his dying, eighteen-thirty-two. And within that second part, a poem sings, \"The King of Thulé.\" A king, his queen gone, the gift of a goblet, now a tomb in his hand. He drinks, he weeps, remembers. Then, a hollow echo in his heart, he knows his time is come. He gives his all to his children, keeps the goblet, a cold comfort. To the cliff he walks, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and follows it down, down, down.\n\nThe King of Thulé, Poe's dreamer, a shadow, maybe, of loss, of a bottle's hollow embrace. Faust, it was made into a play, a drama of shadows by H.P. Grattan in eighteen-forty-two, a year before Poe's own dark use of the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nTwice in his own words, Poe speaks of Thulé. \"Ulma Thule\" in the Pendulum, a whisper. But in \"Dream-land,\" it hangs, a bookend, twice repeated. \"The King of Thulé,\" \"Dream-land,\" they stand together, companions in the dark. In \"Dream-land,\" the speaker walks the landscape of Thulé, a place of shadows, of loneliness, ghosts whispering at his heel, a world drained of color.  Goethe's poem, the king's grief, his emptiness, his world turned to ash, it's all there, mirrored in Poe's words.\n\nGoethe, he was a giant, a writer Poe couldn't help but know, even if only for the sake of Tennyson.  \"I admire Tennyson,\" Poe said, and behind that, a world of echoes, of shared words and borrowed dreams.",
            "The law in this godforsaken state holds that a man who slips on a spilled jar of applesauce, his bones brittle and his life laid out like a map of misery, might find some measure of justice in the coin of punitive damages. The question hangs heavy: can a man claim such recompense when the manager, a man named Martin, turned a blind eye to the slick trail of fruit, twice warned of its treachery?\n\nThe judge, a hardened soul forged in the fires of a thousand petty disputes, ain't likely to toss this claim out with the morning's trash. To win such damages, the plaintiff, a woman named Palmer, must show that Martin's actions weren't just negligent, but steeped in a willful disregard for the fate of his customers.  She'll argue that Martin knew, or should have known, the danger. The years before were stained with the blood of other spills, other broken bodies. He'd heard the cries, seen the fallen, yet still he chose the comfort of his supper over the safety of his store. Whether his actions are truly \"despicable,\" a word that tastes like ash on the tongue, is a matter for the jury to decide.\n\nThe facts are cold and stark. On a day in October, a man named Wayne, a servant in Martin's domain, brought word of the spilled applesauce. Martin, his belly full of the bounty of the earth, offered only a dismissive shrug. Another servant, Haddigan, came bearing the same news, but Martin's ears were deaf to her pleas.  And then came Palmer, her life shattered on the slick floor, her back a twisted monument to Martin's indifference.\n\nThe law, a labyrinth of words and precedents, offers a sliver of hope for the injured. It speaks of malice, of a disregard for human life that borders on cruelty. It whispers of punishment, of a reckoning for the man who turns a blind eye to the suffering of others.",
            "Four years gone now since I sat in that classroom at CBC, the air thick with the dust of scripture and the friction of belief. We wrestled with the question then, a question that hangs heavier still in this time: was Islam a hostile faith? The world, spit from the fire of 9/11, had watched the media shift its gaze, from the scorn of suspicion to a blanket of uneasy acceptance. A name like Barack Obama, a name that echoed with the murmur of a distant faith, could scarcely have been uttered in the year 2001.\n\nThe Prophet’s story, it drew me in, not for its glory, but for the dissonance it held. I’d been taught of conquest, of tribes forced under the yoke of Islam, their voices stifled by the sword. Yet the biography painted a different picture, a man humbled, misunderstood, a martyr even. People drawn to him, not by force, but by a conviction that bloomed slowly, like a flower in the desert.\n\nThere are echoes in the stories, whispers of the miracles wrought by Jesus. The multiplying mutton and milk, a feast made from nothing. A narrative spun to paint Muhammad as a man of unwavering faith, untouched by the need for worldly validation. A shadow falls across this, a suspicion that the sun of Christ’s divinity is being eclipsed by a borrowed light.\n\nAnd the witnesses, their voices echoing through generations, filtered through the haze of hearsay. A chain of whispers, each link growing flimsier, the truth obscured.\n\nPerhaps the most unsettling aspect is the attempt to elevate Muhammad, to cast him as a godlike figure, gentle, wise, compassionate. History, however, tells a different tale, a tale of a man forged in the fires of ambition. I wonder, do those who follow him today know the truth, the weight of the past?",
            "The words the man called Jesus spoke, the truths he held dear, were cast aside like chaff on the wind the moment he was gone.  The cloth of Christian thought, once woven with his threads, took on a life of its own, twisting and turning, straying further from its source with every passing generation. The world, it seems, marches ever onward, a procession of progress, a relentless tide of change. The old ways cling, sure, like barnacles to a hull, but they are few and brittle. They cannot hold back the rising tide. There will come a time, a reckoning, when the dust settles and the true heart of the matter is revealed. A yearning will rise, a hunger to strip away the layers of dogma, to see the man behind the myth, the words behind the pronouncements. It will be a long road, paved with centuries perhaps, but the path is set. The clock will turn backward, unwinding the centuries of accretion, until only the bare bones of Jesus' message remain. And when this tide washes over the land, drowning the false idols in its wake, the church itself, that ancient edifice, will stand strong, a beacon in the returning darkness. But the faith it guards will be transformed. The vast, splintered multitude of Christendom will coalesce, drawn together by a single, unwavering faith. The differences that have plagued them for centuries will fade, swallowed by the rising tide. This is the way of things, the way of history. It is the cycle of empires, the pendulum swing. From persecution to power, from darkness to light, from slavery to freedom. And now, it will turn once more, on the altar of faith. The great reversion is coming, a return to the source, a stripping bare of the soul. And to make this possible, the words of Jesus will be read anew, not as pronouncements from on high, but as whispers from the heart, metaphors for a deeper truth.\n\nSo tell me, what has transpired since the day he walked this earth? What has been added, what has been lost? \n\nLook back through the mists of time, and you will find only Judaism, the seed from which Christianity sprouted.  The belief in a single God, the authority of the scriptures, the revelation of a divine will. These were the pillars upon which the faith stood when the Romans set their foot on Jerusalem in the year of our Lord 63 BC. But even then, the children of Israel were not one. They were divided, fractured into sects - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots - and the common folk who straddled the line between.",
            "The belly of the beast. That's what Sinclair called it. The Jungle. And inside, men were no different than the animals they slaughtered. Greed. That was the root. It choked the air, thickened the blood, turned men's hearts to rust. The factory owners, men with eyes like cold steel, they saw only the bottom line. The smoke that poured from their chimneys, black as a sinner's soul, it was the breath of their hunger. They cared nothing for the men they chewed up and spit out, the women and children too frail to stand against the machine.  \n\nSinclair paints a picture, stark and unforgiving. Buildings like tombstones against the sky. Rivers of smoke, a shroud over the land.  The stench of death, of blood and offal, clung to everything. The men, their faces etched with grime and despair, they were shadows in the machine, cogs in a wheel grinding them down.\n\n\"From top to bottom,\" Sinclair wrote, \"a seething cauldron.\" No loyalty, no decency. Just the cold, hard currency of dollars. They stole their lives. Their sweat, their blood, their very breath. And when they were spent, discarded, they were left to rot in the muck of Packingtown.\n\nEven the unions, those supposed bastions of hope, they were but another hand reaching into the till.  Only the masters profited, the wolves in fine suits. The workers, they were trapped, slaves to a system that devoured them whole.

White, he used for the pretty kind of things, the high class, the kind that fades with time. Gray, it was the opposite. Older, tired, worn down.\n\nHe'd sprinkle them through the story, white chins and gray faces, white roads and gray skies. Even the names of folks at Gatsby's parties, they were just gray smudges on a list. He'd paint with these colors, making the reader see the world through his eyes, feel the dust of the valley, the chill of the gray houses.\n\nAnd then, when you least expect it, he'd use those colors to tell you something. Like Daisy, she was a white blur, a ghost in a white dress. A beautiful thing, maybe, but empty.  A white void, something Gatsby chased after but couldn't reach.\n\nFitzgerald, he knew how to use words. He knew how to make you feel.",
            "The sun baked San Diego County, coaxing life from the soil. Tomatoes plumped, citrus hung heavy, a sea of green from leafy greens and squash stretching as far as the eye could see. Broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers—all grew fat and sweet under the endless sky. A hunger for the clean, the natural, pulsed through the region. Organic food, a bounty from the earth untainted, was in demand. Community Supported Agriculture, letters carried on the wind from farm to table, had waiting lists stretching long as the desert shadows. Eggs and milk, organic and fresh, were sought after treasures. Farms, some open to the public, beckoned with tours, paths winding through the rows, birdsong a constant symphony. This was the kind of farm the land could bear, a place to honor the soil, to draw profit from the earth's bounty while keeping the wild things safe. A place where the government's hand could lend aid, not to stifle, but to nurture, where education and recreation could bloom alongside the crops.\n\nBut the path of the organic farmer is not paved with gold. It demands a different kind of toil, a constant vigilance. Weeds and pests, they come like shadows, and the chemicals that banish them are not options here. The soil must be coaxed, nurtured, and the yield, it is often smaller. The small farm, it lacks the scale, the economy of the giants, but in its heart beats the rhythm of a different kind of wealth.\n\nBiodiversity, a tapestry of life, thrives where chemicals are banished. The earth breathes easier, the creatures find solace. But the cost, it is borne by the hands that labor, the sweat that stains the brow. Cover crops, grazing managed with care, the fight against invasive species—all these things demand time, attention, and a labor of love.\n\nAnd so, the landowner in this story, he stands at a crossroads. He sees the potential, the promise of a land that yields both profit and life. But the path is not easy. He needs help, guidance, a hand to steady his steps.\n\nThe land itself, a tapestry woven from chaparral, the whispers of Mediterranean grasses, and the stoic presence of oak woodlands, lies just beyond the town of Potrero. It is a piece of the East County Southern Foothills, a realm where the Cleveland National Forest stretches out like a green embrace.  This land, it is part of a larger story, a conservation plan that seeks to protect the dwindling creatures, the kangaroo rat, the yellow-legged frog, the butterflies with wings of stained glass, the gnatcatcher, a songbird with a fragile voice.   \n\nThis land has known many lives. The ancient ones, the whispers of Native Americans, long before the trail of the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers carved its way into the landscape.  Homestead claims, grants from a past long gone, a legacy of grazing, of wood, a whisper of what was and what could be again.  \n\nA piece of property, found on a screen, a map of possibilities. Research, a search for the tools, the programs, the hands that could help shape this land into a haven. An example, a model of what could be, a farm in the same region, already living the dream.",
            "Culture. A shadowed thing. As much what it ain't as what it is. Not some uniform cloth stitched tight. Not a single thread. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, that's a fool's cartography.  A map drawn with broad strokes, ignorance bleeding into the lines.  Understand the weight of a culture, sure, how it sits like a stone in the belly of a man. How it shapes the talk at the table. \n\nWhen you walk into a strange land, you see it through the lens of your own. Comparisons rise, like smoke from a fire. To know a foreign mind, you gotta dig deep. Into history, into the dark corners of its prejudices.  Don't judge. Don't try to change it. Accept it, the good and the bad. Work within its bones. Especially when you're at the table with a weaker hand. \n\nCulture ain't just bound by nations. It whispers in the halls of corporations too. Some places, the hours stretch long, the hours bleed into the night. Others, they move at a gentler pace. You see it in the way they dress, the words they choose, who they give power to. Some places, charity is a prayer whispered in the heart. Others, it's a ledger book, entries marked with the company's approval. Even in America, the heart of a company can beat different rhythms,  from city to town, from corner office to factory floor. \n\nValues. That's the heart of it.  The why. If saving face is sacred, a man won't break his own to win a deal. If hard bargaining is the creed, he won't back down easy. \n\nKnow these things before you sit down at the table. But more than that, know the man across from you.  Look into his eyes.  That's where the real deal is made.",
            "The fool, he’d said it in his heart. \"There is no God.\" A line from the Psalms, they say, the book of psalms. A starting point for Anselm, that man, in his talk of a God. And Aquinas, he too held fast to this belief. Both men, wrestling with the same notion, the same God, the God of the Book. To compare them, we must first presume their ground is true, that God is, that he is the God they speak of. \n\nBut what is this God? And does he need proving?\n\nAnselm, he looked inward. Found God in the mind. Said that to conceive of his nonexistence was impossible. A tangled web, his words, but the thread was clear: the proof of God lies within. No need to seek him in the world, he said, only look to what the mind already knows. A kind of faith, this, a leap into the dark.\n\nAquinas, he went a different way. He sought proof in the world, in the things that could be seen and touched. Five arguments he laid out, like stones on a path: change, cause and effect, the fact that things are not eternal, the gradation of goodness, and the harmony of the universe. He said that logic itself pointed to God, that the existence of the world demanded a maker.\n\nBoth men, seeking the same truth, but by different roads. But do they truly reach it? Or is it just a shadow, a reflection in the mind?",
            "The prince, he'd be known as Buddha some day. Born in the dusk of the fifth or sixth century before the reckoning. He cast off the world, found the light, and his words took root, blooming into Buddhism. The Theravada strain, the oldest branch, still clings to the roots. Yet it's a different world now, two and a half thousand years on. Look to Sri Lanka, a land of Theravada, where they cut the water each year in a ceremony. Monks and men, shoulder to shoulder. A ritual, no doubt, but one Buddha never spoke of.  The changes seep in, from the skin of the tradition to its bone. The Theravada people, both the robed and the lay, have had to bend and shift, their doctrines like driftwood in a tide.\n\nThere are forces at play, shaping the current. Inside forces, from those who walk the Buddhasasana path, whether cloaked or free. Outside forces, those from beyond the fold. Hostile forces, aiming to wound or break the community, born of spite or misunderstanding. And benign forces, indifferent to the river's flow, though they may leave a ripple in their wake. These forces, they'll echo through this telling.\n\nFirst, the heart of the matter: the doctrines that hold Theravada firm.  Refuge is sought in the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma, the teachings, are gathered in the Tripitaka, three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka, the words of Buddha himself. The Vinaya Pitaka, the rules for living, the way of the monk and the lay. And lastly, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the depths of being, where truths like Anatta—no soul—and Dukkha—the sting of life—and Anicca—the ever-changing world—are held. Only by knowing these can one escape Sansara, the endless wheel of birth and death. And with it, lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion—will fade, leaving only enlightenment.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka lays out the path for all. Five precepts for the lay: no killing, no lying, no stealing, no lust, no intoxicants. For the monks, a more intricate web of rules, a tighter leash.  But at the core, the Four Noble Truths. Life is Dukkha, that's the first. Attachment fuels the fire of suffering, the second. But there's a way out, the third. And the fourth: the path to freedom lies in the Eightfold Path.",
            "The land of the Egyesült Államok and Mexico, two nations bound by a shared border, were once locked in a long-held feud. A feud that stretched like a serpent's shadow, from 1836 to the year 1893, a span of fifty-seven years. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  The high tide of this conflict crested with the Mexican-American War, a storm of steel and fire from 1846 to 1848. The north, the Egyesült Államok, struck, and Mexico fell. Texas and the Southwest, lands rich with promise, were claimed for the victor. But skirmishes, smaller fires in the long night, continued to flicker between the two nations, fading finally on the eve of the Great War. \n\nThe roots of this bitterness ran deep, tangled in the soil of differing faiths, customs, and ways of life.  Material interests, too, clashed, a grinding friction that set the two nations at odds. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This dance of rivalry is not unique. Nations sharing a boundary, their fates intertwined, often find themselves locked in a struggle for dominance. Like echoes in the canyons, the United States and Mexico mirrored the jealousies and ambitions of nations wedged together by geography.  As Pletcher (1977) observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). These nations, close in proximity, stood as rivals, while others in the south basked in a more amicable sun.\n\nReligion, a potent force, cast a shadow over the relationship.  Frahm (2001) reminds us, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  Like the Cold War, a clash of ideologies, the tensions between the United States and Mexico were woven from both belief and self-interest. Yet, the battleground was not political, but spiritual, a struggle over the soul of nations. This suspicion, born of the old world, lingered.  The English and Spanish, their shadows stretching back centuries, had sown the seeds of distrust, a legacy that poisoned the well of diplomacy.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalogued seventeen disputes between the two nations,  a litany of grievances stretching over fifty-seven years. Most were territorial skirmishes, echoes of the border wars: raids from one side into the other, outlaws seeking refuge in the lawless spaces between.  Bandits and lawbreakers, their motives as tangled as the barbed wire fences, fueled the flames of conflict.  It wasn't until both nations, weary of the endless struggle, committed their armies to the border that the violence finally receded. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) argues that the rivalry waned as Mexico, like a supplicant, found itself increasingly reliant on the north.  By the late nineteenth century, the Egyesült Államok’s ambitions shifted from conquest to economic control, their sights fixed on the riches of Mexico. And so, the long-held feud, like a dying ember, finally flickered out. (p. 109, p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years gone now. A sickness came on sudden, unexpected. A thing I'd never known. I was a nurse then.  A trade chosen out of a need for the kind of security I'd lacked as a boy.  \"You'll always be needed,\" they'd said. \"Folks always get sick.\" A mantra hammered home from adolescence on. So I took to the wards, even though the dream had been a different kind.  Science, maybe.  Journalism.  A little of both, if you please. But the dream, well, it faded.\n\nThen came the fall. Forty-six years on this earth, single, no savings to speak of, and the work, it left me. Still does. Fifteen years of living on what the government allows, and I'm left with nothing.  Nothing that's truly mine. I make do, but each day is a fight, a gnawing at the edges of my security, my safety, my pride.  Nothing certain anymore except this: I wouldn't have made it without the hand of my family, a few good souls.  And let me tell you, when the real disaster strikes,  strength ain't much more than a whisper.\n\nLife throws you curves, big and small.  No guarantees. No matter how you plan, there are things too vast to face alone. \n\nThey talk about small government, the \"rugged individualism\" that built this land.  But truth is, what got our forefathers through wasn't grit, it was the helping hand, the shared load, the kindness between men.  Those pioneers who crossed the Rockies, they didn't do it alone. They relied on each other.\n\nSo yes, be prepared.  I am.  Got my kit: flashlight, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods.  Water tablets, plastic sheeting for the windows, just in case.  If you've got the land, the means, a small farm, can your own food.  A wood stove, if you're lucky enough to have a place for it.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors. That's the real strength.",
            "The why of things. The turning of the forms. Why do they take the shape they do?  Are there unseen hands guiding them, constraints upon their becoming?  D’Arcy Thompson spoke of it long ago, a truth still felt in the marrow: \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\"  True enough then, and true now.  \n\nBut the tools have sharpened.  Mathematical models, they've been applied to the making of the shells, the skeletogenesis of the mollusks, through the crawling of time, the ontogeny, and the branching of lineage, the phylogeny.  Raup and Stanley, they laid it out back in '81.  \n\nOur work, it probes this further.  Using the Prunum, a spiral of the sea, we seek to understand what forces shape its form, the direction and measure of its change.  We took X-rays, peering into the bones, drawing lines of measurement, feeding them into the belly of the machine, CerioShell, a program spun from code. We spun models, hypothetical forms, ghosts of shells yet to be, to see the edges of what is possible.  These we marry with the flesh and blood, the living study, to pierce the veil of time, to see the grand sweep of change in this lineage.\n\nA shell, it's a tube, a journey through three hundred and sixty degrees of space, a spiral unwinding. Each turn, a whorl, spiraling around a central axis, the columella.  The speed of this unwinding, it varies. A suture, a scar, marks the path between whorls.  The last whorl, the body whorl, it's the grandest, the final flourish. The rest, the spire, a silent symphony of turns. The apex, the tip, points skyward.  The base, the opposite end, rests upon the earth.  And through an aperture, a mouth, the creature emerges.\n\nWe look at the shell from above, from below, from the front, from the back.  The aperture, it's the face, the window to the world.  We count the whorls, tracing the line of the suture, dividing the shell, measuring the journey.\n\nA shell, it's a story told in space and time. Each whorl, a chapter, a moment captured.  We can chart its path, the center of each aperture, the radius of its span, and write its story in the language of numbers.\n\nAnd with this language, we can twist the threads, change the parameters, and see how the form might shift, how evolution dances its intricate dance.",
            "The death rattle of babes and babes yet unsprung had held a stubborn stillness in Indonesia these last ten years. The nation moved, it seemed, on a path toward the ghosts of promised goals: water and sanitation targets met, perhaps. But the health of mothers and children, that was a different song altogether. A song of want and hunger, sung in the language of numbers far too high, far too woeful. The reasons for this, they lie buried in the heart of the matter, in the bones of the country's own making. To mend this, a stronger spine is needed, not more patchwork remedies.\n\n72% of births now saw the face of a skilled hand, they say. But skilled is a word that holds many shades. Midwives, wise women of tradition, could not mend a womb torn asunder. Hemorrhage, the crimson flood, claimed its victims still. Progress, then, a thin veneer, a brittle shell. And the children, those small souls under five, their battles with the gut-wrenching grip of diarrhea, they fought alone more often than not. Data on the care given after birth, a shadow story, but even in its darkness, the lack of care, the absence of touch, it whispers a chilling truth.\n\nThe knife's cold kiss, the cesarean, it was rare. 4% of births bore this mark. But in the city, it danced at 7%, while in the villages, it lingered at a paltry 2%. A chasm, a gulf, between the haves and the have-nots, exposed. The lifeblood of health, it flowed in the veins of the city, leaving the countryside parched. And the poor, they were choked by the weight of coins, their pockets empty, their access to care a distant dream. A 27% gap, a canyon bridged by nothing but despair.\n\nWhat then, is the path forward? To build new programs, like towers of hope, or to strengthen the very foundations of the system itself? The siren song of quick fixes, of targeted programs, it calls. Easier to manage, to measure, to claim victory. But a house built on shifting sand, it crumbles in the wind. Resources drain, poured into one well, leaving others to wither. And the machinery of bureaucracy, it grows fat on paperwork, on forms, on an endless cycle of waste.",
            "The Victorians, they wrote of detail, of the gilded cages of their age. But two tales, they stray from the thread. *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, they whisper of shadows and strangeness. A darkness that lingers in the corners of the soul. These tales weave a mystery, a kind of fevered dream that clings to the characters, seeping into their bones. It's in the whispers of their fears, in the way their eyes betray what their words cannot. \n\nConsider this: A boy, lost in a labyrinth of his own making. *“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”* (Dickens, 220) \n\nThe boy, Oliver, adrift in a sea of pain and confusion. He is haunted by the echoes of violence, his mind a battlefield of conflicting images. He is a puppet dancing on the strings of fate, unable to control the darkness that closes in around him.\n\nThe mystery, it seeps into the dreams, into the waking hours. Like a slow poison, it unravels the fabric of reality. In *Oliver Twist*, these dreams are a glimpse into the boy's soul, a window into the horrors he has witnessed and the pain he carries within.\n\nThe shooting, it hangs over him like a shroud. A relived agony, a constant reminder of his vulnerability. He is consumed by the pain, his senses numbed to the world around him. He is a hollow shell, a ghost in his own life.\n\nThe question lingers: who is to blame? Is it the cruelty of the world, or the weakness of his own spirit? The novel leaves the answer unresolved, a haunting echo that lingers in the silence.",
            "Two years gone. I was workin' in one of them after-school programs, mindin' kids, see. Elementary age. Tried to help 'em out with whatever ailed their learnin', but English, that was my trade. Readin', writin', that was where I shone. Got pulled aside by one of the teachers, a man named Ramirez, about a boy named Adrian. Third or fourth grade, somethin' like that. Adrian, he was havin' a right mess with the readin'.\n\nAt first, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Letters, see, he'd nail some, spit 'em out clean. Others, he'd garble 'em somethin' fierce. Like he was speakin' a tongue I couldn't grasp. Knew he was Latino, that much was plain. But the boy, he spoke English like a native. Struggled on for a spell, we did. Till one day, Adrian's mama walked in. The rest of the kids were away on some field trip, leavin' me holdin' the fort with a bunch of rambunctious youngsters. Her, she didn't speak a lick of English. Just Spanish, plain and simple. Had a go at it, I did, with the little Spanish I'd picked up. Barely enough to get by. But then it hit me, like a blow to the gut: Adrian, he wasn't readin' wrong. He just didn't know the damn alphabet. Not the English one, that is.\n\nDon't know if that revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doin' better now.\n\nThat story, I tell it to show the problem of language, the walls it builds in our schools. Especially here in California, where the tongues are many. It ain't always as clear-cut as we think. Even a boy who speaks English like a bird, readin' can be a mountain he can't climb.\n\nWe all know the problem's there. So what's the fix? For Adrian, it was simple enough: a little extra help with readin', learnin' the alphabet, how the sounds come out. But for the kids who barely speak English at all, well, that's a whole other beast. Ain't no one answer. Dual language, immersion, tutors, ESL classes, none of it alone will do the trick. It's a mix, a blendin' of all those things.\n\nDual language, that's a good start. Not just for kids whose first tongue is Spanish, but for all of 'em. Studies show, kids in these kinda programs, they do better. Some folks, they fear it, say it wastes time and money. That the majority of kids won't benefit. But that's a lie. If we made these programs the rule, not the exception, every child would come out ahead.\n\nHow do we do it? Do we make every teacher bilingual?  That's a tall order, ain't it? Unrealistic, maybe. But what if we had folks, aides, tutors, somethin' like that, who spoke both tongues? That'd be a start.",
            "From the time the light first found its way into your eyes they told you there was something out there. Something vast. Something beyond the ken of man. Some were sent to the house of the Lord, others to the synagogue, others still to the silence within. Faith, a hand-me-down garment, often worn without question. But some, they tore the seams, the fabric unraveling, leaving them naked in a universe of their own making.  A universe where the only truth was the echo of their own beating heart.  And so they wandered.  Each a pilgrim searching for their own light in the dark.\n\n“A cardinal,” he said, voice rasping like wind through dry leaves. His eyes, fixed on the rain drumming on the tin roof, saw something more than the water.  Something lost. Something remembered.  The porch, shrouded in a grey mist, whispered of the things that were and the things that would be.  He was thinner now, his clothes hanging loose on his frame, a sparrow in a cage too big for him.  His hair, sparse and wispy, like the smoke from his cigarette, drifting upwards into the storm clouds.  He didn't look at me.  I sat there, the silence a heavy shroud.  Words, useless, tangled in my throat.  I reached out, a hand over his shoulder, and drew him closer.  We watched the rain, two souls caught in the current of time.\n\nHe died in December, five days after I turned twenty-two.  The doctors, they said it was a mercy.  But mercy for whom?  He lingered, a ghost in a fading light, his suffering a silent plea.  I thought then, if there was a God, he had turned his back on us both.  I said no prayers.  There was no solace in the whispers of the dead, no comfort in the words of the living.\n\nI couldn't watch him go.  Not like that.  I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he became.  I knew him better than anyone else.  He wouldn't have wanted me there.  So I stayed away.  Curled up in my bed, in the darkness, waiting for the news.  And the news never came.",
            "The Gothic, Watt called it an oxymoron, \"Old-New.\" A contradiction in terms.  Praised and damned. Shallow and profound.  A haunted mirror peering into the terrible sublime. Walpole, he built the first one, The Castle of Otranto.  Old playhouse ghosts and new world whispers, a novel born of two eras. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" \n\nThe word itself, \"Gothic.\" A whisper of the past, a stain of the old ways, a shadow of something grand and fallen. Archaic, they said. Unsophisticated.  But Walpole, he saw something else, something buried beneath the dust. He saw the drama, the spectacle, the lingering echo of a time when men were men and battles were fought with honor. He took that old world, that chivalric fire, and he poured it into the new form of the novel, where the reader walks beside the knight, feels the weight of his soul. \n\nAnd so the Gothic endures. The past, forever present.\n\nChivalry, that's the heart of it. The knight, the ideal. Brave, honorable, a shield against the darkness.  But the world, it had changed.  The old ways were fading. Walpole, he saw that. He saw the decay, the corruption. And in that decay, he saw a reflection of himself, a man caught in the storm, a witness to a world losing its way.\n\nFrederic, his knight, his hero.  He carries the weight of the past, the burden of a fallen world.  A prince, a victim, a shadow of the knight he might have been.\n\nThat's the Gothic.  A haunted house. A broken hero. A world struggling to remember its own soul.",
            "The flow of goods, a restless serpent from the point of order to the raw earth, through the forge of production, the arteries of supply, the weight of distribution, and finally to the waiting hands of the customer. The term, \"supply chain management,\" a cold coinage minted in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant in the trade, speaks of planning, of execution, and of control, all aimed at satisfying the hunger of the customer with speed and a certain grim efficiency.  Six pillars hold this chain aloft: production, supply, the hoard of inventory, the placement of facilities, the ceaseless motion of transportation, and the pulse of information. These are the tools the managers wield, striving to offer comfort to the consuming world.\n\nProduction, the first beat of the heart, is the foundation. It lays bare the when, the why, the where, and the how of creation.  Managers must know the desires of the market, for the market is a mirror reflecting the wants of the many. The murmur of demand guides their hand, dictating what will be wrought and in what quantity. Once the vision is clear, the managers turn their attention to the forge, seeking the place where the goods will take shape, where volume and quality will coalesce.  The customer's need must always be the north star.  The rhythm of work, the care of the machinery, these are the next steps, each detail a thread in the tapestry of the process. A misstep, a flaw in the design, can unravel the whole, costing time and money like a leaking vessel.   I've seen this myself, working in the great stores, Wal-Mart and Target, where each task, from the uniform of the worker to the delivery of a truckload, is meticulously outlined.  Such order ensures the smooth flow of commerce, a symphony of motion without discord.\n\nThe second pillar is supply, the lifeblood coursing through the veins of the chain. It is the art of choosing, of selecting the core capabilities of a facility, of forging partnerships with those who can offer strength and speed.  A single product may be born in many workshops, each with its own tools, its own people, its own expertise. The manager must be a weaver, threading these threads together, aligning the right division with the right process. Sometimes, the wise manager chooses to relinquish control, to outsource the work to others, seeking velocity, that elusive quality of speed and flexibility, while keeping the cost low, a tightrope walk between efficiency and expense.",
            "The sign sagged in her hand, the words a jagged script against the cardboard: Hitler is alive in Burma. Ellen Page, a face from some distant movie, stood alone on the cracked asphalt, her vigil a lonely island in the flow of indifferent traffic. Burma. Myanmar. A place where the sun beat down on a country ruled by shadows, a junta that had seized power in the dust of a coup, decades gone. \n\nThey called it the Saffron Revolution, a name that tasted of incense and blood. Monks, robed in saffron, had taken to the streets, their voices a fragile flame against the cold wind of oppression. At first, the junta had allowed them to gather, to chant their prayers, but the flame grew. The people, weary of the long night, began to join.  But the flame was not meant to burn. It was snuffed out, the streets running red with the blood of the faithful. Foreign eyes, cameras rolling, were met with the same iron fist. A Japanese man, Kenji Nagai, they said, shot dead for simply witnessing the flames.  Thirteen they said. But the desert whispers spoke of a silence deeper than death, a score that could not be counted.\n\nThis was nothing new. The hunger for power, the thirst to crush dissent, it was an old song, sung in every tongue, every time and place. The Caesars, they claimed to be gods, their will the law of the land. The emperors of Japan, those living gods, their hands stained with the ink of Motorola and the blood of hara-kiri. And here, now, in this land of cracked asphalt and broken promises, the echoes of that song still rang.\n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity yearning for a breath of freedom, drowned in a tide of tanks. The numbers danced, whispered from lips too afraid to speak. Two hundred? Two thousand? Three thousand?  Rwanda, a land consumed by hate, where neighbors turned on neighbors, the air thick with the stench of death. The Holocaust, a stain upon the soul of humanity, a testament to the depths of depravity.\n\nThe sign still hung in the air, a question mark in a world of answers. Hitler is alive in Burma. A lie, perhaps. Or a truth too terrible to bear.",
            "Duke Ellington's shadow falls long on jazz. His years, they stretched like a river, carving a sound all his own. The piano, it hums in his work, a low thrum beneath the surface, but his genius bloomed in shaping the orchestra. He built frameworks, cages of notes where soloists could fly free, and in those spaces, they shone. He wove tight tapestries of sound, drawing out the essence of each man, each instrument. Each note, a brushstroke on the canvas of the whole, painting pictures that bled into one another, new and strange. \n\nThe Grove, they call it, that book of music, they speak of his voice, his use of it as an instrument, a thing of texture and color. Creole Love Call, they say, a whisper of that.  It's a blues, slow and deliberate, twelve bars long. Six choruses, each a breath, each a step closer to the heart of the sound. A call and response, a duet between voice and reeds, smooth at first, then rough, like a turning tide. A trumpet, muted, its voice a sigh, stretching the melody, bending notes. Then a clarinet, soaring high, a fleeting bird against a backdrop of syncopated piano. The band echoes, a call and response, brass and reeds, a symphony of voices. The reeds take the lead now, high and urgent, backed by the stop-time pulse of brass and rhythm. The voice, it growls, a lonely animal, a solo instrument. A tag, a final flourish, a vocal run, a trombone's dissonance.\n\nIt's a language, this Ellingtonian sound, a conversation between instruments and voices. In Hot and Bothered, a year later, it’s there again, in the interplay between Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat.  A blending, a blurring of lines, where voice and instrument become one. In It Don't Mean a Thing, Nanton, the trombone man, he steps forward, his muted voice a dark, rich melody.",
            "The need had always been there, a hunger in the bone that no filling could satisfy. It began at fourteen, a whisper in the blood, a coming-of-age in the shadows. Three years gone and it still gnawed, though now the shape of it was clear. Not a thing, but a being. A man. Yet none of the boys, the clumsy suitors with their awkward advances, stirred anything within her. They were shadows themselves, passing through her life like smoke. She’d wrestled with this emptiness, trying to find the root of it, the cause of this barren field in her young heart. Theories bloomed and withered, leaving her with only questions. So she lived, a question mark in the vastness of her own existence.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, like a still pond. Her parents, they were good people, calm and weathered like old oaks. Their words were rarely raised, their arguments even rarer. Their only discord was her own rebellion, her insistence on a life outside their quiet dominion. She was a storm in their gentle landscape, a whirlwind of laughter and independence, a bright spark in their calm world.\n\nBut this day, the stillness was broken. As she drifted from room to room, searching for inspiration in the mundane, a cry tore through the quiet. Her mother’s voice, thin and sharp as a broken glass. Panic gripped her, a vise around her chest. \"Mom? What is it?\"\n\nShe found her mother on the kitchen floor, crumpled like a fallen leaf. Her face contorted in pain, each breath a gasp. \"Ow…sweetheart…hospital…\" The words came in ragged bursts.\n\nHer daughter knelt beside her, a desperate hand reaching for hers. \"Okay, Mom. Where can I get you?\"\n\nHer mother's hand, clammy and weak, pointed. In that moment, the daughter felt a wellspring of strength, a fierce protectiveness. She lifted her mother, the weight a burden but the need to help a heavier thing.\n\nThe car ride was a blur. The hospital, a place of antiseptic smells and fear, held no sway over her. Her mind was fixed on her mother, her pulse a frantic drum against her own.\n\nShe carried her mother inside, her voice a desperate plea for help. The doctors swarmed, their faces a blur of concern. Her mother was whisked away, leaving her daughter alone in the sterile waiting room.\n\nA fall, a reaching hand, a vase from a high shelf. It was a simple story, a cruel twist of fate. But for her daughter, it felt like the end of the world.",
            "They set out to see if a way of eating, the Mediterranean diet, could ward off the slow, grinding sickness of the heart. The aMed, they called it, a stricter version, all green things and fish and olive oil, and less of the red meat and the fat. It was a life lived closer to the sun, they said.\n\nOld studies had hinted at a connection, a whisper of this diet holding back the grave. Some said it helped the heavy souls shed pounds, and others that it calmed the blood. But no one had looked at the strokes, the sudden icy grip of death.\n\nThey gathered a flock of women, nurses, mostly, their lives laid bare in the cold light of questionnaires. They tracked them for twenty years, asking about what they ate, what they did, and what ailed them. The women, they kept coming back, year after year, their stories feeding the research like breadcrumbs.\n\nThey found the women who ate like the aMed lived longer, healthier lives. Their hearts were quieter, their strokes less frequent. It was a small comfort, a flicker of hope in the long, dark valley. \n\nBut the heart, it is a stubborn thing, and the strokes, they come when they will. Even with the best diet, the best life, death comes calling.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, the United States of America, cracked. A sickness spread through its veins, a financial fever that turned the markets to ash. Men lost their work. Houses, once havens, became monuments to failure. Giants of industry, titans of commerce, crumbled like dust. This sickness, this wound, it hasn't healed. It festers still. We must ask, then, how it came to be.\n\nThe answer, it lies in the hands of men, their greed and their blindness. They, the ones in power, they pushed for easy credit, for loans to those who couldn't afford them. They built a house of cards, propped it up with promises and smoke. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, these were the names whispered in hushed tones, the instruments of this folly. They bought the bad loans, packaged them, sold them off like poisoned fruit. The whole rotten structure stood precariously, waiting for the wind to blow.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown long before, back in the 90s, under the gaze of a president seeking another term. He sought to buy his way back into power, promising prosperity to all. He loosened the reins, opened the floodgates. A man named Holmes, he saw it coming. He warned of the storm, but his words were swallowed by the roar of the crowd. He spoke of a government rescue, a repeat of the savings and loan debacle. But who would listen?\n\nMortgages became twisted, complex beasts. Adjustable rates, securities, obligations, all tangled together, binding the country to the housing market. The common man, he borrowed, he overextended, he built his future on a foundation of sand.\n\nAnd then, the bubble burst. The ground gave way. The institutions that had devoured the poisoned fruit, they choked on their greed. Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers - names etched in stone, monuments to their downfall. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, they were forced to bend the knee, to become mere shadows of their former selves. Fannie and Freddie, they too fell, $5 trillion in debt, swallowed whole by the government.",
            "Exposition. A tricky thing. A writer's first temptation, the urge to lay it all bare. To build the world, brick by brick, detail by detail. To tell the reader every goddamn thing, lest they miss a single thread. And sometimes, it works. The reader is enthralled, swept up in the torrent of words. But more often, it's a slow, suffocating crawl. A landscape of words, barren and lifeless. The reader's eyes glaze over, their attention wandering, their hand creeping toward the back button.\n\nShow, don't tell. The old adage. But the devil whispers in your ear. \"Get it out of the way,\" he hisses. \"The good parts are coming. The heart of the story.\" But the heart of the story isn't built on facts and dates and histories. It's built on the quiet moments, the unspoken truths, the shadows that dance between the lines.\n\nThink of a man.  A simple man, maybe. A gas station attendant with eyes that have seen too much. He's a man of few words, but his silence speaks volumes. He's haunted by a past he can't outrun, a past that spills out in dreams and nightmares. He pours coffee for strangers, their faces blurring together like ghosts. He talks of fishing, but his gaze drifts to the highway, to the endless road that stretches out before him, a promise and a threat. \n\nDon't tell me he was a soldier. Show me the way he stands, shoulders squared, eyes scanning the horizon. Show me the tremor in his hand when he reaches for the coffee pot. Show me the way he flinches at the sound of a siren.\n\nDon't tell me he's lost love. Show me the empty chair at the table. Show me the faded photograph in his wallet. Show me the way he looks at the sky, searching for an answer he knows he'll never find.",
            "The flickering light of the box cast shadows on the wall. Two voices, one a woman's, the other a man's, drifted from the screen. Columbus. Ohio. August, 13th, 2011. The first story. A man named Shad Hostettler. Ashley. A wife. Stabbed.  The mugshot. Eyes like dead coals. Two minutes. Not enough. Not nearly enough for the violence done.  \n\nThen a boy.

            "The blood ties bind. A pact sealed in the marrow. Love, sure, but envy too. Cruelty. A brother sees his own face mirrored in another. Knows him deeper than any other. This truth, it rises in the face of the breaking storm. The cost is high, this knowing. The shadow of a brother's actions stretches long. When he looks into those eyes, he sees not what the world sees, but the man he is. The man he's meant to be. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\" two boys wander a landscape thick as blood. Their journey, a futile dance with fate. Disappointment, bitter as gall, clashes with a pride that claws and tears. Only one returns from the edge. The story unfolds in the warp and weft of the boy's soul. A narrator caught between the boy and his world, caught in the maelstrom of his own making.\n\nThis boy, he is consumed by pride. From the first clumsy steps, from the moment he sees the child that will be his brother, a resentment festers. He yearns for a brother to run with, to share the secrets of the world, to race to the Landing, to perch with in the old pines. But the boy he's given is frail, a thing of whispers and shadows. A heart too weak to keep pace. The boy's dreams, they splinter like glass. He feels a rage, dark and cold, a thought that claws at his mind: a pillow, a smothering darkness. But then a smile. A flicker of light in the boy’s eyes. Hope. The rage recedes, but leaves a stain.",
            "The mind. A chamber of echoes. A darkling forge where thought is hammered into being. Men have always tried to map its labyrinthine paths, to hold its mysteries in the palm of their hand. They’ve likened it to wax, to papyrus, to a book. Now, they speak of circuits and algorithms. But these are but pale reflections, flickering shadows against the stark walls of the unknown.\n\nThe senses, they are the first whispers, the faintest light in the cavern. Touch, heat, sound, light. Transmuted into whispers of electricity, a language understood by the brain’s silent machinery. Upward and downward, the signals flow, a river carving its course through the stone. A box. Black on white. The mind assembles the fragments, piecing together the image from the raw data. A box. Or is it a void, a hole in the white expanse?\n\nAttention, a fickle god. A spotlight in the darkness, illuminating only what it chooses. A thousand blades of grass beneath your feet, yet you see none. Your name, a whisper in a storm, and it cuts through the clamor, a beacon in the night.  \n\nKnowledge. A fragile thing, held in the grip of memory. Sensory, fleeting as a dream. Working, a flickering flame, sustained for a brief moment. Long-term, a tapestry woven from threads of protein, a record of all that has been.\n\nAnd the mind itself, a vast and tangled web of connections. Nodes and pathways, a silent city of thought. A mapmaker's dream, but the map is ever changing, a landscape etched in the sand, shifting with the tide.",
            "The desert wind howls a cold song through the bones of this Brave New World. Huxley, he sees the coming storm, the dust devils of technology and the iron grip of a world built on want.  The people, they are ghosts, their souls traded for a hollow comfort, their minds filed smooth by the grinding gears of community.  Happiness, it is a cheap drug, dispensed by the World Controller, a mask for the emptiness that gnaws at their insides.\n\nMarx whispers in the shadows, his specter a chill against the manufactured warmth. Homogeny, reification, these are the tools of the iron fist, the language of a world where the individual is nothing but a cog in the machine.  \n\nThe masses, they are mesmerized by the glittering trinkets of false consciousness. They see only the surface, blind to the chains that bind them.  Their labor, their sweat, it feeds the maw of the World Controller, a silent, invisible predator.  Hegemony, it is the law of this land, a game of power played out in the shadows, the haves and have-nots separated by an unbridgeable gulf of indifference.\n\nLove, it is a forgotten word, a ghost story whispered in the wind.  Relationships are transactions, devoid of meaning, their souls as empty as the vacant stare of the people who live within these walls.\n\nHuxley, he shows us the world we are building, a world where the human spirit is crushed beneath the weight of progress. He warns us, but his voice is lost in the roar of the machinery, a lone cry in the desolate wasteland of tomorrow.",
            "The stone dust of these hills had settled under my boots for nigh on two and a half years now. Four and a half semesters. Getting across this spread out campus, a task for most, had been my own. Freshman year found me tucked away in the East Halls, a place where the wind whispered tales of the distant stadium and the Jordan Center. Willard Building, a stone's throw from the heart of it all, felt a lifetime away. Twenty-five minutes on foot, I reckon, and longer still when the skies wept down on us, as they often do in this State College. \n\nAn alum, not much older than myself, spoke of a time when the East Halls stood alone, ringed by fields of nothing. Now, those fields were swallowed by new growth - sports fields, buildings rising like monuments - a Creamery, a health services building. All surrounded by the brick and mortar of apartments. The campus, it seemed, had a hunger for expansion, and with it, a growing ache in the bones of those who sought to traverse its breadth.\n\nThe bicycle, I believe, holds the answer. But a bike is a tool, not a cure. It requires hands to guide it, and a land that welcomes its wheels. \n\nA friend, newly returned to the saddle after years away, spoke of it as a revelation. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"they're the only way.\" He spoke of efficiency, of the body's grace, of miles swallowed in the wake of a breakfast of oatmeal and the turning of wheels.  \n\nI live now beyond the campus walls, a distance that echoes the reach of some of those dormitory rooms. The wisest decision I've made this year was the purchase of a bicycle. Thomas Building, a quarter hour's walk by foot, becomes a mere five minutes on two wheels. Pollock Road, a straight shot to my destination, is a treacherous passage, but the bike, it cuts through the danger.\n\nWalking has its merits, I'll concede, but time, it is a precious commodity.  Without my bike, walking would be my only solace. Two and a half hours a week, it would steal from me, not counting the hours spent traversing the campus for appointments and the like. Time I cannot afford to give."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The work they called social work called to me. Helping the lost children, the broken families. That's where I saw myself, in the Division of Family and Children Services. A life dedicated to service, respect, and the hard-won ethics of the trade. To mend the frayed edges of families, to offer a hand to those in need. These weren't just words, these were the things that lived inside me.\n\nI'd always felt a pull towards helping, but the path was obscured. High school, college, a parade of faces running from their troubles, or clinging to crutches that wouldn't hold. I watched it all unfold, and that's how I found myself with a degree in Psychology, still searching.\n\nA summer lay ahead, a time for rest, for reflection. A friend's house, a boy sitting stiffly on the couch, his eyes wide with fear. Sixteen years old, escaping the storm of his home. Abusive parents, he said. The next day, the police were called. I felt a pull, a need to do something. I drove to the house, spoke to the officers, offered what little knowledge my degree had given me. They asked me to speak to the parents. \n\nTheir faces were tight, their words a tangled web of excuses. \"Manipulative,\" they called their son, for seeking help. \"Simple disputes,\" they said, as if the boy's terror was some childish game. That day, I knew. This wasn't just a career, it was a calling.\n\nSocial justice, another cornerstone. We talk of individual worth, but what does it mean? We mourn the lost, yet strive to be the same. I don't want to be a shadow, a reflection. I've always fought against the mold, against the quiet conformity. My hair a riot of color, my clothes a statement, piercings piercing the accepted norms. A voice for the voiceless, a protector of the marginalized. I've marched, I've spoken, I've challenged the status quo. This is who I am, and this is what I will continue to fight for.",
            "The paper here takes up the tangled threads of insomnia, weaving them through the looms of biology and society. The biological strand speaks of inheritable codes, of the body's own machinery gone awry. It probes the depths of genes and the hum of neurons, tracing the pathways of sleep and wakefulness through the labyrinthine brain. The sociocultural thread, it delves into the world outside, the web of circumstance that shapes our nights. It considers the weight of race and class, the echoes of history and the burdens of place. \n\nThis examination, it seeks to unravel the mysteries of insomnia through the lens of these two models, to illuminate the interplay between nature and nurture. It sifts through the evidence, the shards of research, to decipher the strengths and weaknesses of each claim. \n\nInsomnia, it can be a shadow cast by itself, or a specter accompanying other maladies of the mind. It can be a whisper in the night, a phantom limb, or a roaring beast. It can be a primary disorder, a dyssomnia, or a parasomnia, a disruption of the natural rhythms of sleep. It can be a consequence of medical strife or the ghosts of substances past.\n\nThe biological model, it delves into the very essence of the sleepless soul. It points to the hypothalamus, the conductor of our inner orchestra, and its conductor's baton, the orexin neurons. It speaks of receptors, GABAB in particular, that whisper secrets of sleep and wakefulness. It reveals how these receptors, when activated or silenced, can summon slumber or banish it.\n\nA study, it reveals,  probing the depths of the mouse brain, uncovers the presence of GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons.  This activation, it suggests, can usher in the embrace of sleep. But a disruption, a glitch in this delicate dance, can leave one tossing and turning, a prisoner in the cage of wakefulness.\n\nThis, it warns, is not merely a tale of mice, but a reflection of our own biological tapestry. If these receptors, these tiny architects of sleep, are indeed shaped by our genes, then the seeds of insomnia can be planted long before the first sleepless night.\n\nThe sociocultural model, it lifts its gaze from the microscopic to the vast expanse of human experience. It recognizes that sleep is not a solitary affair, but a dance woven into the fabric of our lives. It acknowledges the influence of race, class, and the invisible hand of history.\n\nIf the biological model speaks of genes and neurons, the sociocultural model speaks of the world that shapes us. It recognizes that poverty, stress, and trauma can cast long shadows over our nights. It understands that the burden of inequality can manifest in sleepless nights.",
            "The paper turns its gaze upon three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder. First, a sketch of the affliction itself. Then, the matter of diagnosis, the signs, the whispers in the dark. And finally, a glimpse into the ways a teacher in a classroom, a world of noise and clamor, might help a child lost in the sound. \n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, they call it. Auditory Processing Disorder too. It speaks to the way the brain, the hard-wired machinery of the mind, makes use of what it hears. A matter of efficiency, of effectiveness. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, they say it's \"the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing.\" The brain, they say, failing to translate the sounds, to sift the words from the hum. A child who hears, yet cannot understand. Not deaf, but adrift in a sea of sound. The brain, they say, doesn't work right.\n\nThey first spoke of this disorder in the fifties, \"auditory imperception\" they called it. Researchers, poking and probing at children with speech troubles. Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari, in Italy, they began to fashion tests. And Kimura, he came along and spoke of \"dichotic testing,\" a way to map the brain's response. A conference in '77, a spark, a fire ignited.\n\nCAPD, it wears many faces. A child may not hear sounds in space, may struggle to tell one sound from another, may miss the patterns, the whispers in the wind. Sarcasm, a change in tone, it passes them by. One sound drowned out by the next.  The world a jumbled mess.  \n\nDiagnosis is a careful dance. Observation, tests, a hunt for the signs. Audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, they all play a part. Questionnaires, tests with sounds, a symphony of stimuli. No single test, no magic bullet. The cause, a mystery.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, it speaks of a kind of dangerous magic, this illusion. A man or woman cloaked in another's skin, a shadow play of the self. It says that while the lie can serve, for a time, it can also become a trap. A man or woman lost in the guise, swallowed whole. To shed the illusion is to risk loneliness, to stand naked before the world. Some will accept the truth, others will recoil, their eyes wide with betrayal.\n\nAnd the deception of gender, that's a wound that cuts deeper. Why does a soul seek to become something it's not? What drives a woman to don the mask of a man, to become a phantom in a foreign land? In Viola's case, it's the cold grip of survival. She seeks shelter in the guise of a man, a shield against the darkness.\n\nBut this protection comes at a price. She is cut off from the wellspring of her own kind, adrift in a sea of unfamiliar faces. And the lie takes root, twisting and blooming into something unforeseen. Olivia, blinded by the illusion, falls for her charade, mistaking the man for a man. \n\nAnd Orsino, he too, is caught in the web. A love unspoken, a yearning for something beyond reach, fueled by the masquerade. But is it the man that Olivia desires, or something deeper, a hidden truth she cannot name?  Perhaps, in the shadow play of Twelfth Night, Shakespeare shows us the way our own desires can be shaped by the masks we wear. He reveals the fragility of truth, the way it can be both a source of pain and a catalyst for understanding.\n\nOlivia, she moves quickly from one illusion to another, a fickle heart swayed by appearances.  In the end, she sees Viola not as a lover, but as a sister, a bond forged in the crucible of deception.  And so, the play leaves us with a question: what are we willing to sacrifice for love, for truth, for a semblance of self?",
            "The stain of the Reich stretched long and dark across the African sun.  The slaughter of the Ovaherero and Nama, a reckoning etched in blood, stood as a testament to the brutality of their rule.  But empires, like men, are not simple beasts.  The German dominion, sprawled across the continent, wore many faces.  Its policies, like the shifting sands, varied with the winds of place. Education, a flickering candle in the vast darkness, burned with different intensities in each.\n\nWhen the British came, inheriting the husk of German East Africa, they found a people touched by knowledge, literate souls walking in the sun.  In Kamerun, and other shadowed corners of the empire, whispers spoke of the Germans' efforts, their attempts to bring light to the darkness.  But in South West Africa, a different tale unfolded.  A land where the government, with a cold indifference, left the fate of native education to the meager ministrations of missionaries.  \n\nEuropeans, the favored sons, were ushered into the halls of learning, their education nurtured and controlled by the state's iron hand.  The natives, however, remained shrouded in ignorance, the vast majority untouched by the glow of knowledge.  This disparity, a scar upon the land, lingered long after the Reich had crumbled. Other colonies boasted a people awakened, literate and empowered. South West Africa, however, remained trapped in the grip of darkness.\n\nThis paper seeks to unravel the threads that bind this history, to shed light upon the reasons for this divergence.  It delves into the attitudes of the settlers, the whispers of the colonial authorities, and the social, political, and economic forces that shaped the destiny of a people.\n\nThe study of German colonial education is a vast and intricate tapestry, woven from primary sources in the German tongue, penned in the twilight of the empire.  These early works sought to document the shape of education in the colonies, to illuminate the workings of a system both complex and contradictory.  Later writings, in the English tongue, expanded the discourse, comparing the educational landscapes of the various colonies and dissecting the nuances of their practices.  Cohen, in his seminal work, cast a critical eye upon the educational systems of both South West Africa and East Africa, drawing a stark contrast.  He argues that the settler population, a tide of white desires, shaped the distinct features of South West Africa's educational system.\n\n\nThe land itself, a canvas of arid desert and temperate plains, offered a relative respite from the scorching heat of other colonies. This, in turn, attracted a steady influx of European settlers, swelling their numbers to nearly fifteen thousand by 1913.  In East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population, the numbers paled in comparison, a mere five thousand souls.",
            "The classification of Popular Music, a tangled web spun over a century, now encompasses a multitude of genres so numerous they defy easy listing. Each, from rap to rock, country to jazz, folk and beyond, gives birth to subgenres and sub-subgenres, a sprawling, ever-branching family tree.  Heavy metal, a child of rock, has emerged in the past forty years as a genre of remarkable diversity and expression. Its music, a tempest of sound, channels a spectrum of emotions, though often veering toward the shadowed recesses of the human heart. \n\nFrom its nascent days, metal's flexibility was evident. Bands, drawn to its power, began carving out their own niches, spawning subgenres in turn, each a reflection of its own particular vision. And so the chain continues, a labyrinth of sound where the boundaries blur, and the question arises: what, precisely, is heavy metal?\n\nIt has become a chameleon, absorbing elements from other genres, yet its origins remain a vital touchstone. To truly understand the metal that reverberates today, one must first trace its lineage, for it is more than a mere genre—it is a movement, a force that has reshaped the landscape of music.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a child of darkness. A \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more raw power, more theatricality. Less innocence, more virtuosity. The musicians, masters of their instruments, wield their craft with a precision that pierces the soul.\n\nAnd there's a darkness that seeps into its very core, a darkness born of the psychedelic drug boom of the mid-seventies, a time when minds expanded and boundaries blurred.  The music, infused with the otherworldly, became a conduit for the experiences, both joyful and terrifying, that these substances wrought. Metal's visceral qualities, a stark departure from the prevailing pop music of the era, tapped into a primal wellspring of emotion, echoing the dark, brooding themes of the Romantic era.\n\nLyrics, sharp as daggers, capture this essence:\n\n\nThese words, from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" expose the darker side of the Fab Four. A song of highs and lows, a reflection of the drug-induced haze, it is considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response, a challenge, to the Rolling Stones' own foray into heavier, darker territory. The Beatles, proving they could match the Stones' intensity, unleashed this sonic beast upon the world in their iconic \"White Album.\"",
            "The Surrealists were yet to come, their canvases bleeding with dreams. But long before, Henri Rousseau, alone in his studio, was crafting his own. Not just on canvas, but in the marrow of his bones. The Dream, 1910. A woman, eyes wide, bathed in the light of some strange, inner world.  And Rousseau himself, trapped in the labyrinth of his own striving. \n\nRecognition. Acceptance. The whisper of praise from those who knew the language of paint. A hunger gnawed at him, a yearning to be seen. But the world of art, cold and unforgiving, demanded conformity. To sculpt his dreams into the mold of expectation, or to stand apart, a lone figure in a howling wilderness? \n\nThis was the battle raging within him, a battle painted across the years. \n\nRousseau, born in the small town of Laval, was no child of privilege. His father, a tinsmith, his world a hard-scrabble existence.  No lessons in the academies, no gilded whispers of patronage. He toiled as a toll collector, a gabelou, his days measured out in the rhythm of passing carts and coins. Then, a cruel blow: the deaths of his wife and eight children, leaving only a daughter, Julia, to bind him to the world. He sought solace in paint, a language he learned by heart, a refuge from the ache in his soul.\n\nHe wasn't like the others, the artists who romanticized the peasant, the simple folk. He was one of them, his dreams as rooted in the soil as the wheat fields that stretched beyond his window. He knew the hunger, the yearning for something more than the daily grind. \n\nAnd so, he painted.\n\nBut the world of art, a jungle of talent and ambition, offered little comfort. Matisse rose, a comet streaking across the sky, while Rousseau remained in the shadows. He longed to be seen, to be welcomed into the fold, to be more than just a douanier with a brush.\n\n\"Matisse feared the trite,\" wrote Jan Gordon, \"while Rousseau desired the conventional, the accepted,\" a desperate yearning to be deemed worthy.",

Keats, he knew it, said it plain. \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—\" That's all you know on this earth, and all you need to know.\n\nWe learn, we're taught. Facts and figures, how to live in this world. But ethics, aesthetics, these things they seep into you. Not through lessons, but through the marrow. Like a wind that blows through the trees, shaping them, whispering secrets.  \n\nWe study art, we dissect it. We weigh morality, try to pin it down. But it's a slippery thing. Like smoke, it eludes our grasp. We talk of foreground, of shadow and light, of context. Yet these words, they fall short.  There's something else, something that lingers. A ghost in the machine, as it were.\n\nA favorite book, a piece of music that stirs the soul. We struggle to explain it. \"There's just something about it,\" we say. And it's true. There's a something that transcends the words, the brushstrokes, the notes. A hollowness, an ache, a longing.\n\nIt's the same with morals. We can lay out the rules, the dos and don'ts. But the heart, the soul, it knows a different kind of truth. A truth that can't be contained, can't be explained.\n\nLiterature, now that's a thing apart. It's the closest we come to touching this other world.  McKean, he understood it. \"Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"\n\nMorality and art, they're two sides of the same coin. They speak to us on a level deeper than words. They touch the soul, the very core of who we are.",
            "The Germany of now, a fist clenched in the world's hand. A nation forged in the shadow of the Alps, a chill wind blowing from München to the salt spray of Kiel. The same blood runs through Köln's veins on the Rhine, through the heart of the land, to Dresden, a city cradled by the Elbe. It's a tapestry woven from disparate threads, a culture spun from the whispers of tribes long gone.\n\nGermania. The name itself a ghost, a whisper echoing through the ages. Scholars, they scratch and claw at its meaning, but the truth lies buried deep. Tacitus, he claimed it belonged to the Tungrians, a people who crossed the Rhine, their swords singing a song of war against the Gauls. (Tacitus, 98.) Caesar, that butcher of men, he first used the word \"Germanus,\" a label to distinguish the conquered Gauls from those who held fast to their land. Taken from the Gauls themselves, a word meant to mark the difference, the line between victors and the vanquished. Some say it came from the Gaulish tongue, a word for neighbor, a word turned weapon. Caesar, in his own blood-soaked chronicle, writes of them: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others whisper of the spear, the \"ger,\" a weapon wielded in the heart of battle. Or perhaps from the Old Irish word, \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" a testament to their fierce voices that echoed across the plains. (Names of Germany)\n\nTacitus, his pen a scalpel dissecting history, wrote in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" a testament to the origins of these people. \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nRome, a colossus, looked upon Germania with a cold curiosity. They sought its riches, its furs, its amber. They sent their legions, their swords tasting the blood of the Germanic tribes, but Rome, in the end, turned its gaze elsewhere. The tribes, they lived on the edges, trading their wares, their skills, their blood in the ranks of the Roman legions. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "The pit yawned open below. I looked in.  Mind a blank slate, the picture etched itself there.  No emotion, no judgment. Just the cold, clear gaze of a thing seeing.  Thoughts, wisps of smoke, rose and vanished in the stillness.  The world flowed through me, a river of light and shadow. No thoughts of my own, just the current.\n\nOnce, an artist I knew, his eyes like chips of flint, told me of a book, *The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain*.  He said it taught you to see. To see the way a pencil moved, the way the world itself was made of lines.  He said to frame your vision, box it in, until all that was left was the essence. A bowl of fruit, not a kitchen, not a life.  Just the bowl.\n\nThe bowl before me now. I could not frame it.  It choked me, suffocated me.  Picasso with his blues, Monet with his greens, the Italians with their riot of colors.  This was my palette, the brown of the earth, the brown of decay.  Work in Brown, I thought.\n\nMy fingers brushed the cold porcelain. Muscles tensed, then slacked.  The will to shape, to mold, to create.  The water, a mirror of the sky, calm and deep.  A flake, a whisper, a moment of detachment.  Muscles tightened, a struggle, a spasm.  The handle slammed down.  Nothing.  A stubborn knot, a lump of defiance.\n\nMop in hand, tie a noose around my throat, I stared.  A message, scrawled in brown ink.  More flushes, more silence.  Then, the paper.  A slow, deliberate movement, wrapping, concealing.  Like a grave digger, preparing the earth.  My hand plunged in, a mother gathering her child.",
            "The young ones are dying behind the wheel.  A confluence of things, a tangle of roots, brings them to this reckoning. The Institutes, they say, the brain ain't fully formed yet.  Not ready for the reckoning of the road. And inexperience, that's the heart of it.  A raw nerve that bleeds out in fatal crashes, in vehicles rolled like dying beasts, in reckless speed and the edge of the asphalt.\n\nThey're worse, these young ones, with their kind amongst them.  A fact known to any man with a lick of sense.  The Center in California, they studied it, the age of the passenger and the accidents they brought.  A grim dance.\n\nStates, they try.  Provisional licenses, they call 'em.  Hours limited, friends kept at bay.  But these are just bandages on a gunshot wound.  The truth is, they ain't ready.  Not by the numbers. Not by the cold, hard facts.  Doctor Zuckerman, he says it plain.  Eighteen, too young.  The young ones, they crave the rush, the thrill of the edge.  It's in their blood.  Delay the wheel, he says, let the hunger fade.\n\nWe keep handing out licenses, though.  And the dead pile up.  More soon, when the boomers' children come of age. Millions of them, hungry for the road.  A reckoning waits.\n\nThe law, it ain't hard to write.  Schools, they can teach, but no hands on the wheel 'til eighteen.  A permit, maybe, and hours behind the wheel with a guide.  Six hours, fifty hours, the numbers are already there.  Across the states, a uniform law, a national shield.\n\nNot a new idea, no.  But maybe, just maybe, it's time we made it real.",
            "The Library of Congress, a monument to the dead past, housed a collection of Edison's early films. I set out to watch them all, fifteen or so, from the waning years of the century to the dawning of the new. Trick films, they were called, illusions conjured by the cut and splice of celluloid. My study leaned toward the poetics of these tricks, the common thread that wove them together, and the few that dared to break free, to stray from the path.  \n\nMostly, these early films were bound to the stage, confined within a frame as rigid as a proscenium. The camera, a silent observer, never moved. It held its ground, a drone in the eye, capturing the world in long shots, medium shots, never a close-up. The one-shot rule held true, each idea, each flicker, captured in a single, unbroken take.\n\nThe set, the stage, it was always there, a constricting presence. Figures moved side to side, like marionettes on strings, never approaching or receding, never truly leaving the frame.  Look at \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" a phantom from 1900. The actors, shadows in the gloom, step in from the right, vanish into the darkness, but the camera, unblinking, holds its gaze.\n\nThe proscenium, a cage, dictated the form. The audience, like spectators in a darkened theater, saw the whole world at once, framed by the edges of the stage.  The actors, tethered to the middle ground, never breached the boundaries. Close-up, intimacy, a foreign concept.\n\nEach film, a single idea, a single shot, told in a minute or less.  A glimpse, a trick, a vanishing act, a story whispered and gone. But be wary, for the illusion is a lie. What appears as a single shot may be many, stitched together, a tapestry woven from fragments. Look closer at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" a relic from 1895.  The severed head, a phantom flicker, a trick of the light, a joining of disparate moments.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline. A man of the soil. A farmer. And though the fields were his calling, the soil itself spoke to him of freedom, of self-reliance. A man made by the land, he saw the government then as a reflection of that land, and in his mind, the land was best left untamed, fiercely independent. He spoke of republics, of rights, of a Constitution meant to be a fence, not a cage. He believed in the nature of man, the darkness and the light, and that a government too strong would only fan those flames. He saw the dangers of a hungry power, a government swollen by ambition, and he saw the virtue in the simple life, the life of the farmer, the life lived close to the earth. The Declaration, he said, was the real testament, a whisper of sovereignty from the heart of the nation. A nation of states, not a single, monolithic whole. He wanted the government small, its reach limited, its touch light, lest it smother the very thing it sought to protect.",
            "The chart, Figure Seventeen, tells a story. A stark drop in commuter logs the third month in. A discouragement, to be sure. Why this fall? Winter's bite had settled on the New England bones. Fewer souls walking or pedaling to class. December, the semester's end, a flurry of grades and deadlines. The log, a forgotten thing in the clamor. Then the holidays, that long shadow swallowing the campus, students and faculty dispersed. January, a slow awakening, classes stirring. Still, February, the logs remained scant. \n\nPerhaps the initial spark, that first burst of interest, had faded. A natural thing, maybe. So they built a Carpool Challenge Week, a firestorm in March, to reignite the flame. It worked, the logs climbed again. But the challenge remained: to hold the light against the winter of disengagement, against the cycles of school and season.\n\nAnother challenge: the allure of the car, an ingrained hunger for freedom, for the open road. A cultural beast. To lure them away, you need bait. They offered trinkets, gift cards to coffee shops and bookstores, even massages. But what of bigger prizes? A bicycle, a sleek hybrid, a silent electric dream? Perhaps that would have kept the logs full, year-round. The prizes remained the same, a meager offering against the siren song of the engine. \n\nWhat if the prizes, like the winter sky, grew brighter? Imagine, a promise whispered in December: a bicycle, a reward for the journey ahead. Then in January, bolder still: a hybrid, a whisper of the future. Maybe then, the logs would have sung a different song.",
            "The ticker, they call it ETF, for Exchange Traded Fund. A cage, you might say, holding a collection of stocks, commodities, or even a phantom index. Like a stock, it moves on the boards, bought and sold in a flash.  But within that cage, a whole world. Diversification, they promise, spread thin against risk. Yet, a closer look reveals a price to pay. A commission for each trade, a toll to cross the threshold.\n\nThere are whispers, too, of expense ratios, lower than the old mutual funds, but still a weight on the scales. And the question lingers: does this cage truly offer the spread promised? Does owning a single ETF truly mirror the spread of a hand-picked portfolio?\n\nWe'll take IHF, a cage of its own, and examine its contents. The ten strongest holdings, they say, make up  more'n sixty percent of the cage's worth.  We'll compare these ten, these individual souls, to the cage itself. Will they sing the same song? Will their returns match the cage's, or will they offer a different tune altogether?  \n\nWe'll speak in numbers, in terms of Beta and Return, the metrics of the trade. But remember, numbers can lie. They can paint a picture, but the truth often hides in the shadows. We'll need to dig deeper, to look beyond the surface, to see if the cage's promise holds true.",
            "Dream-land. One of Poe's own words, he called it a better poem. In it, he speaks of Thulé, a word echoed twice, like a ghost, in lines six and fifty-six. Mabbott traces it back to Virgil, the old man who wrote of an island north of Britain, a place the Greeks reckoned the world's edge. Virgil, he used it, that's for sure. But there's a newer whisper, a breath from across the sea, a German wind. Poe, he had eyes for those writers, spoke their tongue in his own way.\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his book, he lays it out plain: Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon. The echo there, Arndt says, is more than a passing fancy. Poe, he was mimicking the master.\n\nOxford, they speak of Goethe, a writer celebrated for his Faust, a play in two parts, the first born in eighteen-oh-eight, the second in the year of his dying, eighteen-thirty-two. And within that second part, a poem sings, \"The King of Thulé.\" A king, his queen gone, the gift of a goblet, now a tomb in his hand. He drinks, he weeps, remembers. Then, a hollow echo in his heart, he knows his time is come. He gives his all to his children, keeps the goblet, a cold comfort. To the cliff he walks, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and follows it down, down, down.\n\nThe King of Thulé, Poe's dreamer, a shadow, maybe, of loss, of a bottle's hollow embrace. Faust, it was made into a play, a drama of shadows by H.P. Grattan in eighteen-forty-two, a year before Poe's own dark use of the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nTwice in his own words, Poe speaks of Thulé. \"Ulma Thule\" in the Pendulum, a whisper. But in \"Dream-land,\" it hangs, a bookend, twice repeated. \"The King of Thulé,\" \"Dream-land,\" they stand together, companions in the dark. In \"Dream-land,\" the speaker walks the landscape of Thulé, a place of shadows, of loneliness, ghosts whispering at his heel, a world drained of color.  Goethe's poem, the king's grief, his emptiness, his world turned to ash, it's all there, mirrored in Poe's words.\n\nGoethe, he was a giant, a writer Poe couldn't help but know, even if only for the sake of Tennyson.  \"I admire Tennyson,\" Poe said, and behind that, a world of echoes, of shared words and borrowed dreams.",
            "The law in this godforsaken state holds that a man who slips on a spilled jar of applesauce, his bones brittle and his life laid out like a map of misery, might find some measure of justice in the coin of punitive damages. The question hangs heavy: can a man claim such recompense when the manager, a man named Martin, turned a blind eye to the slick trail of fruit, twice warned of its treachery?\n\nThe judge, a hardened soul forged in the fires of a thousand petty disputes, ain't likely to toss this claim out with the morning's trash. To win such damages, the plaintiff, a woman named Palmer, must show that Martin's actions weren't just negligent, but steeped in a willful disregard for the fate of his customers.  She'll argue that Martin knew, or should have known, the danger. The years before were stained with the blood of other spills, other broken bodies. He'd heard the cries, seen the fallen, yet still he chose the comfort of his supper over the safety of his store. Whether his actions are truly \"despicable,\" a word that tastes like ash on the tongue, is a matter for the jury to decide.\n\nThe facts are cold and stark. On a day in October, a man named Wayne, a servant in Martin's domain, brought word of the spilled applesauce. Martin, his belly full of the bounty of the earth, offered only a dismissive shrug. Another servant, Haddigan, came bearing the same news, but Martin's ears were deaf to her pleas.  And then came Palmer, her life shattered on the slick floor, her back a twisted monument to Martin's indifference.\n\nThe law, a labyrinth of words and precedents, offers a sliver of hope for the injured. It speaks of malice, of a disregard for human life that borders on cruelty. It whispers of punishment, of a reckoning for the man who turns a blind eye to the suffering of others.",
            "Four years gone now since I sat in that classroom at CBC, the air thick with the dust of scripture and the friction of belief. We wrestled with the question then, a question that hangs heavier still in this time: was Islam a hostile faith? The world, spit from the fire of 9/11, had watched the media shift its gaze, from the scorn of suspicion to a blanket of uneasy acceptance. A name like Barack Obama, a name that echoed with the murmur of a distant faith, could scarcely have been uttered in the year 2001.\n\nThe Prophet’s story, it drew me in, not for its glory, but for the dissonance it held. I’d been taught of conquest, of tribes forced under the yoke of Islam, their voices stifled by the sword. Yet the biography painted a different picture, a man humbled, misunderstood, a martyr even. People drawn to him, not by force, but by a conviction that bloomed slowly, like a flower in the desert.\n\nThere are echoes in the stories, whispers of the miracles wrought by Jesus. The multiplying mutton and milk, a feast made from nothing. A narrative spun to paint Muhammad as a man of unwavering faith, untouched by the need for worldly validation. A shadow falls across this, a suspicion that the sun of Christ’s divinity is being eclipsed by a borrowed light.\n\nAnd the witnesses, their voices echoing through generations, filtered through the haze of hearsay. A chain of whispers, each link growing flimsier, the truth obscured.\n\nPerhaps the most unsettling aspect is the attempt to elevate Muhammad, to cast him as a godlike figure, gentle, wise, compassionate. History, however, tells a different tale, a tale of a man forged in the fires of ambition. I wonder, do those who follow him today know the truth, the weight of the past?",
            "The words the man called Jesus spoke, the truths he held dear, were cast aside like chaff on the wind the moment he was gone.  The cloth of Christian thought, once woven with his threads, took on a life of its own, twisting and turning, straying further from its source with every passing generation. The world, it seems, marches ever onward, a procession of progress, a relentless tide of change. The old ways cling, sure, like barnacles to a hull, but they are few and brittle. They cannot hold back the rising tide. There will come a time, a reckoning, when the dust settles and the true heart of the matter is revealed. A yearning will rise, a hunger to strip away the layers of dogma, to see the man behind the myth, the words behind the pronouncements. It will be a long road, paved with centuries perhaps, but the path is set. The clock will turn backward, unwinding the centuries of accretion, until only the bare bones of Jesus' message remain. And when this tide washes over the land, drowning the false idols in its wake, the church itself, that ancient edifice, will stand strong, a beacon in the returning darkness. But the faith it guards will be transformed. The vast, splintered multitude of Christendom will coalesce, drawn together by a single, unwavering faith. The differences that have plagued them for centuries will fade, swallowed by the rising tide. This is the way of things, the way of history. It is the cycle of empires, the pendulum swing. From persecution to power, from darkness to light, from slavery to freedom. And now, it will turn once more, on the altar of faith. The great reversion is coming, a return to the source, a stripping bare of the soul. And to make this possible, the words of Jesus will be read anew, not as pronouncements from on high, but as whispers from the heart, metaphors for a deeper truth.\n\nSo tell me, what has transpired since the day he walked this earth? What has been added, what has been lost? \n\nLook back through the mists of time, and you will find only Judaism, the seed from which Christianity sprouted.  The belief in a single God, the authority of the scriptures, the revelation of a divine will. These were the pillars upon which the faith stood when the Romans set their foot on Jerusalem in the year of our Lord 63 BC. But even then, the children of Israel were not one. They were divided, fractured into sects - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots - and the common folk who straddled the line between.",
            "The belly of the beast. That's what Sinclair called it. The Jungle. And inside, men were no different than the animals they slaughtered. Greed. That was the root. It choked the air, thickened the blood, turned men's hearts to rust. The factory owners, men with eyes like cold steel, they saw only the bottom line. The smoke that poured from their chimneys, black as a sinner's soul, it was the breath of their hunger. They cared nothing for the men they chewed up and spit out, the women and children too frail to stand against the machine.  \n\nSinclair paints a picture, stark and unforgiving. Buildings like tombstones against the sky. Rivers of smoke, a shroud over the land.  The stench of death, of blood and offal, clung to everything. The men, their faces etched with grime and despair, they were shadows in the machine, cogs in a wheel grinding them down.\n\n\"From top to bottom,\" Sinclair wrote, \"a seething cauldron.\" No loyalty, no decency. Just the cold, hard currency of dollars. They stole their lives. Their sweat, their blood, their very breath. And when they were spent, discarded, they were left to rot in the muck of Packingtown.\n\nEven the unions, those supposed bastions of hope, they were but another hand reaching into the till.  Only the masters profited, the wolves in fine suits. The workers, they were trapped, slaves to a system that devoured them whole. Their cries, lost in the roar of the machines, echoed the emptiness of their souls.",
            "The telling of a story, it ain't just words on a page. It's the feel you leave the reader with, the taste in their mouth. Some writers, they know this. Fitzgerald, he knew it good. He built worlds with words, not just told them. He'd take a word, an image, and twist it, make it mean more than it did on the surface.\n\nColors, he used them like that. Gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. Each one a whisper, a hint. He built meaning into them, slow and sure, like a house being brick by brick. White, he used for the pretty kind of things, the high class, the kind that fades with time. Gray, it was the opposite. Older, tired, worn down.\n\nHe'd sprinkle them through the story, white chins and gray faces, white roads and gray skies. Even the names of folks at Gatsby's parties, they were just gray smudges on a list. He'd paint with these colors, making the reader see the world through his eyes, feel the dust of the valley, the chill of the gray houses.\n\nAnd then, when you least expect it, he'd use those colors to tell you something.

            "The sun baked San Diego County, coaxing life from the soil. Tomatoes plumped, citrus hung heavy, a sea of green from leafy greens and squash stretching as far as the eye could see. Broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers—all grew fat and sweet under the endless sky. A hunger for the clean, the natural, pulsed through the region. Organic food, a bounty from the earth untainted, was in demand. Community Supported Agriculture, letters carried on the wind from farm to table, had waiting lists stretching long as the desert shadows. Eggs and milk, organic and fresh, were sought after treasures. Farms, some open to the public, beckoned with tours, paths winding through the rows, birdsong a constant symphony. This was the kind of farm the land could bear, a place to honor the soil, to draw profit from the earth's bounty while keeping the wild things safe. A place where the government's hand could lend aid, not to stifle, but to nurture, where education and recreation could bloom alongside the crops.\n\nBut the path of the organic farmer is not paved with gold. It demands a different kind of toil, a constant vigilance. Weeds and pests, they come like shadows, and the chemicals that banish them are not options here. The soil must be coaxed, nurtured, and the yield, it is often smaller. The small farm, it lacks the scale, the economy of the giants, but in its heart beats the rhythm of a different kind of wealth.\n\nBiodiversity, a tapestry of life, thrives where chemicals are banished. The earth breathes easier, the creatures find solace. But the cost, it is borne by the hands that labor, the sweat that stains the brow. Cover crops, grazing managed with care, the fight against invasive species—all these things demand time, attention, and a labor of love.\n\nAnd so, the landowner in this story, he stands at a crossroads. He sees the potential, the promise of a land that yields both profit and life. But the path is not easy. He needs help, guidance, a hand to steady his steps.\n\nThe land itself, a tapestry woven from chaparral, the whispers of Mediterranean grasses, and the stoic presence of oak woodlands, lies just beyond the town of Potrero. It is a piece of the East County Southern Foothills, a realm where the Cleveland National Forest stretches out like a green embrace.  This land, it is part of a larger story, a conservation plan that seeks to protect the dwindling creatures, the kangaroo rat, the yellow-legged frog, the butterflies with wings of stained glass, the gnatcatcher, a songbird with a fragile voice.   \n\nThis land has known many lives. The ancient ones, the whispers of Native Americans, long before the trail of the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers carved its way into the landscape.  Homestead claims, grants from a past long gone, a legacy of grazing, of wood, a whisper of what was and what could be again.  \n\nA piece of property, found on a screen, a map of possibilities. Research, a search for the tools, the programs, the hands that could help shape this land into a haven. An example, a model of what could be, a farm in the same region, already living the dream.",
            "Culture. A shadowed thing. As much what it ain't as what it is. Not some uniform cloth stitched tight. Not a single thread. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, that's a fool's cartography.  A map drawn with broad strokes, ignorance bleeding into the lines.  Understand the weight of a culture, sure, how it sits like a stone in the belly of a man. How it shapes the talk at the table. \n\nWhen you walk into a strange land, you see it through the lens of your own. Comparisons rise, like smoke from a fire. To know a foreign mind, you gotta dig deep. Into history, into the dark corners of its prejudices.  Don't judge. Don't try to change it. Accept it, the good and the bad. Work within its bones. Especially when you're at the table with a weaker hand. \n\nCulture ain't just bound by nations. It whispers in the halls of corporations too. Some places, the hours stretch long, the hours bleed into the night. Others, they move at a gentler pace. You see it in the way they dress, the words they choose, who they give power to. Some places, charity is a prayer whispered in the heart. Others, it's a ledger book, entries marked with the company's approval. Even in America, the heart of a company can beat different rhythms,  from city to town, from corner office to factory floor. \n\nValues. That's the heart of it.  The why. If saving face is sacred, a man won't break his own to win a deal. If hard bargaining is the creed, he won't back down easy. \n\nKnow these things before you sit down at the table. But more than that, know the man across from you.  Look into his eyes.  That's where the real deal is made.",
            "The fool, he’d said it in his heart. \"There is no God.\" A line from the Psalms, they say, the book of psalms. A starting point for Anselm, that man, in his talk of a God. And Aquinas, he too held fast to this belief. Both men, wrestling with the same notion, the same God, the God of the Book. To compare them, we must first presume their ground is true, that God is, that he is the God they speak of. \n\nBut what is this God? And does he need proving?\n\nAnselm, he looked inward. Found God in the mind. Said that to conceive of his nonexistence was impossible. A tangled web, his words, but the thread was clear: the proof of God lies within. No need to seek him in the world, he said, only look to what the mind already knows. A kind of faith, this, a leap into the dark.\n\nAquinas, he went a different way. He sought proof in the world, in the things that could be seen and touched. Five arguments he laid out, like stones on a path: change, cause and effect, the fact that things are not eternal, the gradation of goodness, and the harmony of the universe. He said that logic itself pointed to God, that the existence of the world demanded a maker.\n\nBoth men, seeking the same truth, but by different roads. But do they truly reach it? Or is it just a shadow, a reflection in the mind?",
            "The prince, he'd be known as Buddha some day. Born in the dusk of the fifth or sixth century before the reckoning. He cast off the world, found the light, and his words took root, blooming into Buddhism. The Theravada strain, the oldest branch, still clings to the roots. Yet it's a different world now, two and a half thousand years on. Look to Sri Lanka, a land of Theravada, where they cut the water each year in a ceremony. Monks and men, shoulder to shoulder. A ritual, no doubt, but one Buddha never spoke of.  The changes seep in, from the skin of the tradition to its bone. The Theravada people, both the robed and the lay, have had to bend and shift, their doctrines like driftwood in a tide.\n\nThere are forces at play, shaping the current. Inside forces, from those who walk the Buddhasasana path, whether cloaked or free. Outside forces, those from beyond the fold. Hostile forces, aiming to wound or break the community, born of spite or misunderstanding. And benign forces, indifferent to the river's flow, though they may leave a ripple in their wake. These forces, they'll echo through this telling.\n\nFirst, the heart of the matter: the doctrines that hold Theravada firm.  Refuge is sought in the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma, the teachings, are gathered in the Tripitaka, three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka, the words of Buddha himself. The Vinaya Pitaka, the rules for living, the way of the monk and the lay. And lastly, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the depths of being, where truths like Anatta—no soul—and Dukkha—the sting of life—and Anicca—the ever-changing world—are held. Only by knowing these can one escape Sansara, the endless wheel of birth and death. And with it, lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion—will fade, leaving only enlightenment.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka lays out the path for all. Five precepts for the lay: no killing, no lying, no stealing, no lust, no intoxicants. For the monks, a more intricate web of rules, a tighter leash.  But at the core, the Four Noble Truths. Life is Dukkha, that's the first. Attachment fuels the fire of suffering, the second. But there's a way out, the third. And the fourth: the path to freedom lies in the Eightfold Path.",
            "The land of the Egyesült Államok and Mexico, two nations bound by a shared border, were once locked in a long-held feud. A feud that stretched like a serpent's shadow, from 1836 to the year 1893, a span of fifty-seven years. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  The high tide of this conflict crested with the Mexican-American War, a storm of steel and fire from 1846 to 1848. The north, the Egyesült Államok, struck, and Mexico fell. Texas and the Southwest, lands rich with promise, were claimed for the victor. But skirmishes, smaller fires in the long night, continued to flicker between the two nations, fading finally on the eve of the Great War. \n\nThe roots of this bitterness ran deep, tangled in the soil of differing faiths, customs, and ways of life.  Material interests, too, clashed, a grinding friction that set the two nations at odds. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This dance of rivalry is not unique. Nations sharing a boundary, their fates intertwined, often find themselves locked in a struggle for dominance. Like echoes in the canyons, the United States and Mexico mirrored the jealousies and ambitions of nations wedged together by geography.  As Pletcher (1977) observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). These nations, close in proximity, stood as rivals, while others in the south basked in a more amicable sun.\n\nReligion, a potent force, cast a shadow over the relationship.  Frahm (2001) reminds us, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  Like the Cold War, a clash of ideologies, the tensions between the United States and Mexico were woven from both belief and self-interest. Yet, the battleground was not political, but spiritual, a struggle over the soul of nations. This suspicion, born of the old world, lingered.  The English and Spanish, their shadows stretching back centuries, had sown the seeds of distrust, a legacy that poisoned the well of diplomacy.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalogued seventeen disputes between the two nations,  a litany of grievances stretching over fifty-seven years. Most were territorial skirmishes, echoes of the border wars: raids from one side into the other, outlaws seeking refuge in the lawless spaces between.  Bandits and lawbreakers, their motives as tangled as the barbed wire fences, fueled the flames of conflict.  It wasn't until both nations, weary of the endless struggle, committed their armies to the border that the violence finally receded. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) argues that the rivalry waned as Mexico, like a supplicant, found itself increasingly reliant on the north.  By the late nineteenth century, the Egyesült Államok’s ambitions shifted from conquest to economic control, their sights fixed on the riches of Mexico. And so, the long-held feud, like a dying ember, finally flickered out. (p. 109, p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years gone now. A sickness came on sudden, unexpected. A thing I'd never known. I was a nurse then.  A trade chosen out of a need for the kind of security I'd lacked as a boy.  \"You'll always be needed,\" they'd said. \"Folks always get sick.\" A mantra hammered home from adolescence on. So I took to the wards, even though the dream had been a different kind.  Science, maybe.  Journalism.  A little of both, if you please. But the dream, well, it faded.\n\nThen came the fall. Forty-six years on this earth, single, no savings to speak of, and the work, it left me. Still does. Fifteen years of living on what the government allows, and I'm left with nothing.  Nothing that's truly mine. I make do, but each day is a fight, a gnawing at the edges of my security, my safety, my pride.  Nothing certain anymore except this: I wouldn't have made it without the hand of my family, a few good souls.  And let me tell you, when the real disaster strikes,  strength ain't much more than a whisper.\n\nLife throws you curves, big and small.  No guarantees. No matter how you plan, there are things too vast to face alone. \n\nThey talk about small government, the \"rugged individualism\" that built this land.  But truth is, what got our forefathers through wasn't grit, it was the helping hand, the shared load, the kindness between men.  Those pioneers who crossed the Rockies, they didn't do it alone. They relied on each other.\n\nSo yes, be prepared.  I am.  Got my kit: flashlight, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods.  Water tablets, plastic sheeting for the windows, just in case.  If you've got the land, the means, a small farm, can your own food.  A wood stove, if you're lucky enough to have a place for it.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors. That's the real strength.",
            "The why of things. The turning of the forms. Why do they take the shape they do?  Are there unseen hands guiding them, constraints upon their becoming?  D’Arcy Thompson spoke of it long ago, a truth still felt in the marrow: \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\"  True enough then, and true now.  \n\nBut the tools have sharpened.  Mathematical models, they've been applied to the making of the shells, the skeletogenesis of the mollusks, through the crawling of time, the ontogeny, and the branching of lineage, the phylogeny.  Raup and Stanley, they laid it out back in '81.  \n\nOur work, it probes this further.  Using the Prunum, a spiral of the sea, we seek to understand what forces shape its form, the direction and measure of its change.  We took X-rays, peering into the bones, drawing lines of measurement, feeding them into the belly of the machine, CerioShell, a program spun from code. We spun models, hypothetical forms, ghosts of shells yet to be, to see the edges of what is possible.  These we marry with the flesh and blood, the living study, to pierce the veil of time, to see the grand sweep of change in this lineage.\n\nA shell, it's a tube, a journey through three hundred and sixty degrees of space, a spiral unwinding. Each turn, a whorl, spiraling around a central axis, the columella.  The speed of this unwinding, it varies. A suture, a scar, marks the path between whorls.  The last whorl, the body whorl, it's the grandest, the final flourish. The rest, the spire, a silent symphony of turns. The apex, the tip, points skyward.  The base, the opposite end, rests upon the earth.  And through an aperture, a mouth, the creature emerges.\n\nWe look at the shell from above, from below, from the front, from the back.  The aperture, it's the face, the window to the world.  We count the whorls, tracing the line of the suture, dividing the shell, measuring the journey.\n\nA shell, it's a story told in space and time. Each whorl, a chapter, a moment captured.  We can chart its path, the center of each aperture, the radius of its span, and write its story in the language of numbers.\n\nAnd with this language, we can twist the threads, change the parameters, and see how the form might shift, how evolution dances its intricate dance.",
            "The death rattle of babes and babes yet unsprung had held a stubborn stillness in Indonesia these last ten years. The nation moved, it seemed, on a path toward the ghosts of promised goals: water and sanitation targets met, perhaps. But the health of mothers and children, that was a different song altogether. A song of want and hunger, sung in the language of numbers far too high, far too woeful. The reasons for this, they lie buried in the heart of the matter, in the bones of the country's own making. To mend this, a stronger spine is needed, not more patchwork remedies.\n\n72% of births now saw the face of a skilled hand, they say. But skilled is a word that holds many shades. Midwives, wise women of tradition, could not mend a womb torn asunder. Hemorrhage, the crimson flood, claimed its victims still. Progress, then, a thin veneer, a brittle shell. And the children, those small souls under five, their battles with the gut-wrenching grip of diarrhea, they fought alone more often than not. Data on the care given after birth, a shadow story, but even in its darkness, the lack of care, the absence of touch, it whispers a chilling truth.\n\nThe knife's cold kiss, the cesarean, it was rare. 4% of births bore this mark. But in the city, it danced at 7%, while in the villages, it lingered at a paltry 2%. A chasm, a gulf, between the haves and the have-nots, exposed. The lifeblood of health, it flowed in the veins of the city, leaving the countryside parched. And the poor, they were choked by the weight of coins, their pockets empty, their access to care a distant dream. A 27% gap, a canyon bridged by nothing but despair.\n\nWhat then, is the path forward? To build new programs, like towers of hope, or to strengthen the very foundations of the system itself? The siren song of quick fixes, of targeted programs, it calls. Easier to manage, to measure, to claim victory. But a house built on shifting sand, it crumbles in the wind. Resources drain, poured into one well, leaving others to wither. And the machinery of bureaucracy, it grows fat on paperwork, on forms, on an endless cycle of waste.",
            "The Victorians, they wrote of detail, of the gilded cages of their age. But two tales, they stray from the thread. *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, they whisper of shadows and strangeness. A darkness that lingers in the corners of the soul. These tales weave a mystery, a kind of fevered dream that clings to the characters, seeping into their bones. It's in the whispers of their fears, in the way their eyes betray what their words cannot. \n\nConsider this: A boy, lost in a labyrinth of his own making. *“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”* (Dickens, 220) \n\nThe boy, Oliver, adrift in a sea of pain and confusion. He is haunted by the echoes of violence, his mind a battlefield of conflicting images. He is a puppet dancing on the strings of fate, unable to control the darkness that closes in around him.\n\nThe mystery, it seeps into the dreams, into the waking hours. Like a slow poison, it unravels the fabric of reality. In *Oliver Twist*, these dreams are a glimpse into the boy's soul, a window into the horrors he has witnessed and the pain he carries within.\n\nThe shooting, it hangs over him like a shroud. A relived agony, a constant reminder of his vulnerability. He is consumed by the pain, his senses numbed to the world around him. He is a hollow shell, a ghost in his own life.\n\nThe question lingers: who is to blame? Is it the cruelty of the world, or the weakness of his own spirit? The novel leaves the answer unresolved, a haunting echo that lingers in the silence.",
            "Two years gone. I was workin' in one of them after-school programs, mindin' kids, see. Elementary age. Tried to help 'em out with whatever ailed their learnin', but English, that was my trade. Readin', writin', that was where I shone. Got pulled aside by one of the teachers, a man named Ramirez, about a boy named Adrian. Third or fourth grade, somethin' like that. Adrian, he was havin' a right mess with the readin'.\n\nAt first, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Letters, see, he'd nail some, spit 'em out clean. Others, he'd garble 'em somethin' fierce. Like he was speakin' a tongue I couldn't grasp. Knew he was Latino, that much was plain. But the boy, he spoke English like a native. Struggled on for a spell, we did. Till one day, Adrian's mama walked in. The rest of the kids were away on some field trip, leavin' me holdin' the fort with a bunch of rambunctious youngsters. Her, she didn't speak a lick of English. Just Spanish, plain and simple. Had a go at it, I did, with the little Spanish I'd picked up. Barely enough to get by. But then it hit me, like a blow to the gut: Adrian, he wasn't readin' wrong. He just didn't know the damn alphabet. Not the English one, that is.\n\nDon't know if that revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doin' better now.\n\nThat story, I tell it to show the problem of language, the walls it builds in our schools. Especially here in California, where the tongues are many. It ain't always as clear-cut as we think. Even a boy who speaks English like a bird, readin' can be a mountain he can't climb.\n\nWe all know the problem's there. So what's the fix? For Adrian, it was simple enough: a little extra help with readin', learnin' the alphabet, how the sounds come out. But for the kids who barely speak English at all, well, that's a whole other beast. Ain't no one answer. Dual language, immersion, tutors, ESL classes, none of it alone will do the trick. It's a mix, a blendin' of all those things.\n\nDual language, that's a good start. Not just for kids whose first tongue is Spanish, but for all of 'em. Studies show, kids in these kinda programs, they do better. Some folks, they fear it, say it wastes time and money. That the majority of kids won't benefit. But that's a lie. If we made these programs the rule, not the exception, every child would come out ahead.\n\nHow do we do it? Do we make every teacher bilingual?  That's a tall order, ain't it? Unrealistic, maybe. But what if we had folks, aides, tutors, somethin' like that, who spoke both tongues? That'd be a start.",
            "From the time the light first found its way into your eyes they told you there was something out there. Something vast. Something beyond the ken of man. Some were sent to the house of the Lord, others to the synagogue, others still to the silence within. Faith, a hand-me-down garment, often worn without question. But some, they tore the seams, the fabric unraveling, leaving them naked in a universe of their own making.  A universe where the only truth was the echo of their own beating heart.  And so they wandered.  Each a pilgrim searching for their own light in the dark.\n\n“A cardinal,” he said, voice rasping like wind through dry leaves. His eyes, fixed on the rain drumming on the tin roof, saw something more than the water.  Something lost. Something remembered.  The porch, shrouded in a grey mist, whispered of the things that were and the things that would be.  He was thinner now, his clothes hanging loose on his frame, a sparrow in a cage too big for him.  His hair, sparse and wispy, like the smoke from his cigarette, drifting upwards into the storm clouds.  He didn't look at me.  I sat there, the silence a heavy shroud.  Words, useless, tangled in my throat.  I reached out, a hand over his shoulder, and drew him closer.  We watched the rain, two souls caught in the current of time.\n\nHe died in December, five days after I turned twenty-two.  The doctors, they said it was a mercy.  But mercy for whom?  He lingered, a ghost in a fading light, his suffering a silent plea.  I thought then, if there was a God, he had turned his back on us both.  I said no prayers.  There was no solace in the whispers of the dead, no comfort in the words of the living.\n\nI couldn't watch him go.  Not like that.  I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he became.  I knew him better than anyone else.  He wouldn't have wanted me there.  So I stayed away.  Curled up in my bed, in the darkness, waiting for the news.  And the news never came.",
            "The Gothic, Watt called it an oxymoron, \"Old-New.\" A contradiction in terms.  Praised and damned. Shallow and profound.  A haunted mirror peering into the terrible sublime. Walpole, he built the first one, The Castle of Otranto.  Old playhouse ghosts and new world whispers, a novel born of two eras. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" \n\nThe word itself, \"Gothic.\" A whisper of the past, a stain of the old ways, a shadow of something grand and fallen. Archaic, they said. Unsophisticated.  But Walpole, he saw something else, something buried beneath the dust. He saw the drama, the spectacle, the lingering echo of a time when men were men and battles were fought with honor. He took that old world, that chivalric fire, and he poured it into the new form of the novel, where the reader walks beside the knight, feels the weight of his soul. \n\nAnd so the Gothic endures. The past, forever present.\n\nChivalry, that's the heart of it. The knight, the ideal. Brave, honorable, a shield against the darkness.  But the world, it had changed.  The old ways were fading. Walpole, he saw that. He saw the decay, the corruption. And in that decay, he saw a reflection of himself, a man caught in the storm, a witness to a world losing its way.\n\nFrederic, his knight, his hero.  He carries the weight of the past, the burden of a fallen world.  A prince, a victim, a shadow of the knight he might have been.\n\nThat's the Gothic.  A haunted house. A broken hero. A world struggling to remember its own soul.",
            "The flow of goods, a restless serpent from the point of order to the raw earth, through the forge of production, the arteries of supply, the weight of distribution, and finally to the waiting hands of the customer. The term, \"supply chain management,\" a cold coinage minted in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant in the trade, speaks of planning, of execution, and of control, all aimed at satisfying the hunger of the customer with speed and a certain grim efficiency.  Six pillars hold this chain aloft: production, supply, the hoard of inventory, the placement of facilities, the ceaseless motion of transportation, and the pulse of information. These are the tools the managers wield, striving to offer comfort to the consuming world.\n\nProduction, the first beat of the heart, is the foundation. It lays bare the when, the why, the where, and the how of creation.  Managers must know the desires of the market, for the market is a mirror reflecting the wants of the many. The murmur of demand guides their hand, dictating what will be wrought and in what quantity. Once the vision is clear, the managers turn their attention to the forge, seeking the place where the goods will take shape, where volume and quality will coalesce.  The customer's need must always be the north star.  The rhythm of work, the care of the machinery, these are the next steps, each detail a thread in the tapestry of the process. A misstep, a flaw in the design, can unravel the whole, costing time and money like a leaking vessel.   I've seen this myself, working in the great stores, Wal-Mart and Target, where each task, from the uniform of the worker to the delivery of a truckload, is meticulously outlined.  Such order ensures the smooth flow of commerce, a symphony of motion without discord.\n\nThe second pillar is supply, the lifeblood coursing through the veins of the chain. It is the art of choosing, of selecting the core capabilities of a facility, of forging partnerships with those who can offer strength and speed.  A single product may be born in many workshops, each with its own tools, its own people, its own expertise. The manager must be a weaver, threading these threads together, aligning the right division with the right process. Sometimes, the wise manager chooses to relinquish control, to outsource the work to others, seeking velocity, that elusive quality of speed and flexibility, while keeping the cost low, a tightrope walk between efficiency and expense.",
            "The sign sagged in her hand, the words a jagged script against the cardboard: Hitler is alive in Burma. Ellen Page, a face from some distant movie, stood alone on the cracked asphalt, her vigil a lonely island in the flow of indifferent traffic. Burma. Myanmar. A place where the sun beat down on a country ruled by shadows, a junta that had seized power in the dust of a coup, decades gone. \n\nThey called it the Saffron Revolution, a name that tasted of incense and blood. Monks, robed in saffron, had taken to the streets, their voices a fragile flame against the cold wind of oppression. At first, the junta had allowed them to gather, to chant their prayers, but the flame grew. The people, weary of the long night, began to join.  But the flame was not meant to burn. It was snuffed out, the streets running red with the blood of the faithful. Foreign eyes, cameras rolling, were met with the same iron fist. A Japanese man, Kenji Nagai, they said, shot dead for simply witnessing the flames.  Thirteen they said. But the desert whispers spoke of a silence deeper than death, a score that could not be counted.\n\nThis was nothing new. The hunger for power, the thirst to crush dissent, it was an old song, sung in every tongue, every time and place. The Caesars, they claimed to be gods, their will the law of the land. The emperors of Japan, those living gods, their hands stained with the ink of Motorola and the blood of hara-kiri. And here, now, in this land of cracked asphalt and broken promises, the echoes of that song still rang.\n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity yearning for a breath of freedom, drowned in a tide of tanks. The numbers danced, whispered from lips too afraid to speak. Two hundred? Two thousand? Three thousand?  Rwanda, a land consumed by hate, where neighbors turned on neighbors, the air thick with the stench of death. The Holocaust, a stain upon the soul of humanity, a testament to the depths of depravity.\n\nThe sign still hung in the air, a question mark in a world of answers. Hitler is alive in Burma. A lie, perhaps. Or a truth too terrible to bear.",
            "Duke Ellington's shadow falls long on jazz. His years, they stretched like a river, carving a sound all his own. The piano, it hums in his work, a low thrum beneath the surface, but his genius bloomed in shaping the orchestra. He built frameworks, cages of notes where soloists could fly free, and in those spaces, they shone. He wove tight tapestries of sound, drawing out the essence of each man, each instrument. Each note, a brushstroke on the canvas of the whole, painting pictures that bled into one another, new and strange. \n\nThe Grove, they call it, that book of music, they speak of his voice, his use of it as an instrument, a thing of texture and color. Creole Love Call, they say, a whisper of that.  It's a blues, slow and deliberate, twelve bars long. Six choruses, each a breath, each a step closer to the heart of the sound. A call and response, a duet between voice and reeds, smooth at first, then rough, like a turning tide. A trumpet, muted, its voice a sigh, stretching the melody, bending notes. Then a clarinet, soaring high, a fleeting bird against a backdrop of syncopated piano. The band echoes, a call and response, brass and reeds, a symphony of voices. The reeds take the lead now, high and urgent, backed by the stop-time pulse of brass and rhythm. The voice, it growls, a lonely animal, a solo instrument. A tag, a final flourish, a vocal run, a trombone's dissonance.\n\nIt's a language, this Ellingtonian sound, a conversation between instruments and voices. In Hot and Bothered, a year later, it’s there again, in the interplay between Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat.  A blending, a blurring of lines, where voice and instrument become one. In It Don't Mean a Thing, Nanton, the trombone man, he steps forward, his muted voice a dark, rich melody.",
            "The need had always been there, a hunger in the bone that no filling could satisfy. It began at fourteen, a whisper in the blood, a coming-of-age in the shadows. Three years gone and it still gnawed, though now the shape of it was clear. Not a thing, but a being. A man. Yet none of the boys, the clumsy suitors with their awkward advances, stirred anything within her. They were shadows themselves, passing through her life like smoke. She’d wrestled with this emptiness, trying to find the root of it, the cause of this barren field in her young heart. Theories bloomed and withered, leaving her with only questions. So she lived, a question mark in the vastness of her own existence.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, like a still pond. Her parents, they were good people, calm and weathered like old oaks. Their words were rarely raised, their arguments even rarer. Their only discord was her own rebellion, her insistence on a life outside their quiet dominion. She was a storm in their gentle landscape, a whirlwind of laughter and independence, a bright spark in their calm world.\n\nBut this day, the stillness was broken. As she drifted from room to room, searching for inspiration in the mundane, a cry tore through the quiet. Her mother’s voice, thin and sharp as a broken glass. Panic gripped her, a vise around her chest. \"Mom? What is it?\"\n\nShe found her mother on the kitchen floor, crumpled like a fallen leaf. Her face contorted in pain, each breath a gasp. \"Ow…sweetheart…hospital…\" The words came in ragged bursts.\n\nHer daughter knelt beside her, a desperate hand reaching for hers. \"Okay, Mom. Where can I get you?\"\n\nHer mother's hand, clammy and weak, pointed. In that moment, the daughter felt a wellspring of strength, a fierce protectiveness. She lifted her mother, the weight a burden but the need to help a heavier thing.\n\nThe car ride was a blur. The hospital, a place of antiseptic smells and fear, held no sway over her. Her mind was fixed on her mother, her pulse a frantic drum against her own.\n\nShe carried her mother inside, her voice a desperate plea for help. The doctors swarmed, their faces a blur of concern. Her mother was whisked away, leaving her daughter alone in the sterile waiting room.\n\nA fall, a reaching hand, a vase from a high shelf. It was a simple story, a cruel twist of fate. But for her daughter, it felt like the end of the world.",
            "They set out to see if a way of eating, the Mediterranean diet, could ward off the slow, grinding sickness of the heart. The aMed, they called it, a stricter version, all green things and fish and olive oil, and less of the red meat and the fat. It was a life lived closer to the sun, they said.\n\nOld studies had hinted at a connection, a whisper of this diet holding back the grave. Some said it helped the heavy souls shed pounds, and others that it calmed the blood. But no one had looked at the strokes, the sudden icy grip of death.\n\nThey gathered a flock of women, nurses, mostly, their lives laid bare in the cold light of questionnaires. They tracked them for twenty years, asking about what they ate, what they did, and what ailed them. The women, they kept coming back, year after year, their stories feeding the research like breadcrumbs.\n\nThey found the women who ate like the aMed lived longer, healthier lives. Their hearts were quieter, their strokes less frequent. It was a small comfort, a flicker of hope in the long, dark valley. \n\nBut the heart, it is a stubborn thing, and the strokes, they come when they will. Even with the best diet, the best life, death comes calling.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, the United States of America, cracked. A sickness spread through its veins, a financial fever that turned the markets to ash. Men lost their work. Houses, once havens, became monuments to failure. Giants of industry, titans of commerce, crumbled like dust. This sickness, this wound, it hasn't healed. It festers still. We must ask, then, how it came to be.\n\nThe answer, it lies in the hands of men, their greed and their blindness. They, the ones in power, they pushed for easy credit, for loans to those who couldn't afford them. They built a house of cards, propped it up with promises and smoke. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, these were the names whispered in hushed tones, the instruments of this folly. They bought the bad loans, packaged them, sold them off like poisoned fruit. The whole rotten structure stood precariously, waiting for the wind to blow.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown long before, back in the 90s, under the gaze of a president seeking another term. He sought to buy his way back into power, promising prosperity to all. He loosened the reins, opened the floodgates. A man named Holmes, he saw it coming. He warned of the storm, but his words were swallowed by the roar of the crowd. He spoke of a government rescue, a repeat of the savings and loan debacle. But who would listen?\n\nMortgages became twisted, complex beasts. Adjustable rates, securities, obligations, all tangled together, binding the country to the housing market. The common man, he borrowed, he overextended, he built his future on a foundation of sand.\n\nAnd then, the bubble burst. The ground gave way. The institutions that had devoured the poisoned fruit, they choked on their greed. Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers - names etched in stone, monuments to their downfall. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, they were forced to bend the knee, to become mere shadows of their former selves. Fannie and Freddie, they too fell, $5 trillion in debt, swallowed whole by the government.",

To tell the reader every goddamn thing, lest they miss a single thread. And sometimes, it works. The reader is enthralled, swept up in the torrent of words. But more often, it's a slow, suffocating crawl. A landscape of words, barren and lifeless. The reader's eyes glaze over, their attention wandering, their hand creeping toward the back button.\n\nShow, don't tell. The old adage. But the devil whispers in your ear. \"Get it out of the way,\" he hisses. \"The good parts are coming. The heart of the story.\" But the heart of the story isn't built on facts and dates and histories. It's built on the quiet moments, the unspoken truths, the shadows that dance between the lines.\n\nThink of a man.  A simple man, maybe. A gas station attendant with eyes that have seen too much. He's a man of few words, but his silence speaks volumes. He's haunted by a past he can't outrun, a past that spills out in dreams and nightmares. He pours coffee for strangers, their faces blurring together like ghosts. He talks of fishing, but his gaze drifts to the highway, to the endless road that stretches out before him, a promise and a threat. \n\nDon't tell me he was a soldier. Show me the way he stands, shoulders squared, eyes scanning the horizon. Show me the tremor in his hand when he reaches for the coffee pot. Show me the way he flinches at the sound of a siren.\n\nDon't tell me he's lost love. Show me the empty chair at the table. Show me the faded photograph in his wallet. Show me the way he looks at the sky, searching for an answer he knows he'll never find.",
            "The flickering light of the box cast shadows on the wall. Two voices, one a woman's, the other a man's, drifted from the screen. Columbus. Ohio. August, 13th, 2011. The first story. A man named Shad Hostettler. Ashley. A wife. Stabbed.  The mugshot. Eyes like dead coals. Two minutes. Not enough. Not nearly enough for the violence done.  \n\nThen a boy. Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone. Sharon Woods. Shot. A single graze. No arrests. The SWAT men, shadows in the night. A whisper of a story. The color of his skin, a  silent weight in the air.  \n\nThe newsman spoke of a hole in the Med-Flight chopper. A .22. A bullet from the darkness. Five thousand dollars. A reward for silence.\n\nThe rain. A heavy hand on the city. Mid-eighties.  A promise of more stories, more shadows.\n\nA UDF robbed. A dark-skinned man. A hoodie. Six foot tall. One hundred and fifty pounds.  The words hung heavy. A catalog of difference.\n\nRene Rodriguez. A Texas kingpin. Marijuana.  Three hundred months. A lifetime.  A Hispanic man.  The color of his sin.",
            "The blood ties bind. A pact sealed in the marrow. Love, sure, but envy too. Cruelty. A brother sees his own face mirrored in another. Knows him deeper than any other. This truth, it rises in the face of the breaking storm. The cost is high, this knowing. The shadow of a brother's actions stretches long. When he looks into those eyes, he sees not what the world sees, but the man he is. The man he's meant to be. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\" two boys wander a landscape thick as blood. Their journey, a futile dance with fate. Disappointment, bitter as gall, clashes with a pride that claws and tears. Only one returns from the edge. The story unfolds in the warp and weft of the boy's soul. A narrator caught between the boy and his world, caught in the maelstrom of his own making.\n\nThis boy, he is consumed by pride. From the first clumsy steps, from the moment he sees the child that will be his brother, a resentment festers. He yearns for a brother to run with, to share the secrets of the world, to race to the Landing, to perch with in the old pines. But the boy he's given is frail, a thing of whispers and shadows. A heart too weak to keep pace. The boy's dreams, they splinter like glass. He feels a rage, dark and cold, a thought that claws at his mind: a pillow, a smothering darkness. But then a smile. A flicker of light in the boy’s eyes. Hope. The rage recedes, but leaves a stain.",
            "The mind. A chamber of echoes. A darkling forge where thought is hammered into being. Men have always tried to map its labyrinthine paths, to hold its mysteries in the palm of their hand. They’ve likened it to wax, to papyrus, to a book. Now, they speak of circuits and algorithms. But these are but pale reflections, flickering shadows against the stark walls of the unknown.\n\nThe senses, they are the first whispers, the faintest light in the cavern. Touch, heat, sound, light. Transmuted into whispers of electricity, a language understood by the brain’s silent machinery. Upward and downward, the signals flow, a river carving its course through the stone. A box. Black on white. The mind assembles the fragments, piecing together the image from the raw data. A box. Or is it a void, a hole in the white expanse?\n\nAttention, a fickle god. A spotlight in the darkness, illuminating only what it chooses. A thousand blades of grass beneath your feet, yet you see none. Your name, a whisper in a storm, and it cuts through the clamor, a beacon in the night.  \n\nKnowledge. A fragile thing, held in the grip of memory. Sensory, fleeting as a dream. Working, a flickering flame, sustained for a brief moment. Long-term, a tapestry woven from threads of protein, a record of all that has been.\n\nAnd the mind itself, a vast and tangled web of connections. Nodes and pathways, a silent city of thought. A mapmaker's dream, but the map is ever changing, a landscape etched in the sand, shifting with the tide.",
            "The desert wind howls a cold song through the bones of this Brave New World. Huxley, he sees the coming storm, the dust devils of technology and the iron grip of a world built on want.  The people, they are ghosts, their souls traded for a hollow comfort, their minds filed smooth by the grinding gears of community.  Happiness, it is a cheap drug, dispensed by the World Controller, a mask for the emptiness that gnaws at their insides.\n\nMarx whispers in the shadows, his specter a chill against the manufactured warmth. Homogeny, reification, these are the tools of the iron fist, the language of a world where the individual is nothing but a cog in the machine.  \n\nThe masses, they are mesmerized by the glittering trinkets of false consciousness. They see only the surface, blind to the chains that bind them.  Their labor, their sweat, it feeds the maw of the World Controller, a silent, invisible predator.  Hegemony, it is the law of this land, a game of power played out in the shadows, the haves and have-nots separated by an unbridgeable gulf of indifference.\n\nLove, it is a forgotten word, a ghost story whispered in the wind.  Relationships are transactions, devoid of meaning, their souls as empty as the vacant stare of the people who live within these walls.\n\nHuxley, he shows us the world we are building, a world where the human spirit is crushed beneath the weight of progress. He warns us, but his voice is lost in the roar of the machinery, a lone cry in the desolate wasteland of tomorrow.",
            "The stone dust of these hills had settled under my boots for nigh on two and a half years now. Four and a half semesters. Getting across this spread out campus, a task for most, had been my own. Freshman year found me tucked away in the East Halls, a place where the wind whispered tales of the distant stadium and the Jordan Center. Willard Building, a stone's throw from the heart of it all, felt a lifetime away. Twenty-five minutes on foot, I reckon, and longer still when the skies wept down on us, as they often do in this State College. \n\nAn alum, not much older than myself, spoke of a time when the East Halls stood alone, ringed by fields of nothing. Now, those fields were swallowed by new growth - sports fields, buildings rising like monuments - a Creamery, a health services building. All surrounded by the brick and mortar of apartments. The campus, it seemed, had a hunger for expansion, and with it, a growing ache in the bones of those who sought to traverse its breadth.\n\nThe bicycle, I believe, holds the answer. But a bike is a tool, not a cure. It requires hands to guide it, and a land that welcomes its wheels. \n\nA friend, newly returned to the saddle after years away, spoke of it as a revelation. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"they're the only way.\" He spoke of efficiency, of the body's grace, of miles swallowed in the wake of a breakfast of oatmeal and the turning of wheels.  \n\nI live now beyond the campus walls, a distance that echoes the reach of some of those dormitory rooms. The wisest decision I've made this year was the purchase of a bicycle. Thomas Building, a quarter hour's walk by foot, becomes a mere five minutes on two wheels. Pollock Road, a straight shot to my destination, is a treacherous passage, but the bike, it cuts through the danger.\n\nWalking has its merits, I'll concede, but time, it is a precious commodity.  Without my bike, walking would be my only solace. Two and a half hours a week, it would steal from me, not counting the hours spent traversing the campus for appointments and the like. Time I cannot afford to give."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The work they called social work called to me. Helping the lost children, the broken families. That's where I saw myself, in the Division of Family and Children Services. A life dedicated to service, respect, and the hard-won ethics of the trade. To mend the frayed edges of families, to offer a hand to those in need. These weren't just words, these were the things that lived inside me.\n\nI'd always felt a pull towards helping, but the path was obscured. High school, college, a parade of faces running from their troubles, or clinging to crutches that wouldn't hold. I watched it all unfold, and that's how I found myself with a degree in Psychology, still searching.\n\nA summer lay ahead, a time for rest, for reflection. A friend's house, a boy sitting stiffly on the couch, his eyes wide with fear. Sixteen years old, escaping the storm of his home. Abusive parents, he said. The next day, the police were called. I felt a pull, a need to do something. I drove to the house, spoke to the officers, offered what little knowledge my degree had given me. They asked me to speak to the parents. \n\nTheir faces were tight, their words a tangled web of excuses. \"Manipulative,\" they called their son, for seeking help. \"Simple disputes,\" they said, as if the boy's terror was some childish game. That day, I knew. This wasn't just a career, it was a calling.\n\nSocial justice, another cornerstone. We talk of individual worth, but what does it mean? We mourn the lost, yet strive to be the same. I don't want to be a shadow, a reflection. I've always fought against the mold, against the quiet conformity. My hair a riot of color, my clothes a statement, piercings piercing the accepted norms. A voice for the voiceless, a protector of the marginalized. I've marched, I've spoken, I've challenged the status quo. This is who I am, and this is what I will continue to fight for.",
            "The paper here takes up the tangled threads of insomnia, weaving them through the looms of biology and society. The biological strand speaks of inheritable codes, of the body's own machinery gone awry. It probes the depths of genes and the hum of neurons, tracing the pathways of sleep and wakefulness through the labyrinthine brain. The sociocultural thread, it delves into the world outside, the web of circumstance that shapes our nights. It considers the weight of race and class, the echoes of history and the burdens of place. \n\nThis examination, it seeks to unravel the mysteries of insomnia through the lens of these two models, to illuminate the interplay between nature and nurture. It sifts through the evidence, the shards of research, to decipher the strengths and weaknesses of each claim. \n\nInsomnia, it can be a shadow cast by itself, or a specter accompanying other maladies of the mind. It can be a whisper in the night, a phantom limb, or a roaring beast. It can be a primary disorder, a dyssomnia, or a parasomnia, a disruption of the natural rhythms of sleep. It can be a consequence of medical strife or the ghosts of substances past.\n\nThe biological model, it delves into the very essence of the sleepless soul. It points to the hypothalamus, the conductor of our inner orchestra, and its conductor's baton, the orexin neurons. It speaks of receptors, GABAB in particular, that whisper secrets of sleep and wakefulness. It reveals how these receptors, when activated or silenced, can summon slumber or banish it.\n\nA study, it reveals,  probing the depths of the mouse brain, uncovers the presence of GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons.  This activation, it suggests, can usher in the embrace of sleep. But a disruption, a glitch in this delicate dance, can leave one tossing and turning, a prisoner in the cage of wakefulness.\n\nThis, it warns, is not merely a tale of mice, but a reflection of our own biological tapestry. If these receptors, these tiny architects of sleep, are indeed shaped by our genes, then the seeds of insomnia can be planted long before the first sleepless night.\n\nThe sociocultural model, it lifts its gaze from the microscopic to the vast expanse of human experience. It recognizes that sleep is not a solitary affair, but a dance woven into the fabric of our lives. It acknowledges the influence of race, class, and the invisible hand of history.\n\nIf the biological model speaks of genes and neurons, the sociocultural model speaks of the world that shapes us. It recognizes that poverty, stress, and trauma can cast long shadows over our nights. It understands that the burden of inequality can manifest in sleepless nights.",
            "The paper turns its gaze upon three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder. First, a sketch of the affliction itself. Then, the matter of diagnosis, the signs, the whispers in the dark. And finally, a glimpse into the ways a teacher in a classroom, a world of noise and clamor, might help a child lost in the sound. \n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, they call it. Auditory Processing Disorder too. It speaks to the way the brain, the hard-wired machinery of the mind, makes use of what it hears. A matter of efficiency, of effectiveness. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, they say it's \"the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing.\" The brain, they say, failing to translate the sounds, to sift the words from the hum. A child who hears, yet cannot understand. Not deaf, but adrift in a sea of sound. The brain, they say, doesn't work right.\n\nThey first spoke of this disorder in the fifties, \"auditory imperception\" they called it. Researchers, poking and probing at children with speech troubles. Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari, in Italy, they began to fashion tests. And Kimura, he came along and spoke of \"dichotic testing,\" a way to map the brain's response. A conference in '77, a spark, a fire ignited.\n\nCAPD, it wears many faces. A child may not hear sounds in space, may struggle to tell one sound from another, may miss the patterns, the whispers in the wind. Sarcasm, a change in tone, it passes them by. One sound drowned out by the next.  The world a jumbled mess.  \n\nDiagnosis is a careful dance. Observation, tests, a hunt for the signs. Audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, they all play a part. Questionnaires, tests with sounds, a symphony of stimuli. No single test, no magic bullet. The cause, a mystery.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, it speaks of a kind of dangerous magic, this illusion. A man or woman cloaked in another's skin, a shadow play of the self. It says that while the lie can serve, for a time, it can also become a trap. A man or woman lost in the guise, swallowed whole. To shed the illusion is to risk loneliness, to stand naked before the world. Some will accept the truth, others will recoil, their eyes wide with betrayal.\n\nAnd the deception of gender, that's a wound that cuts deeper. Why does a soul seek to become something it's not? What drives a woman to don the mask of a man, to become a phantom in a foreign land? In Viola's case, it's the cold grip of survival. She seeks shelter in the guise of a man, a shield against the darkness.\n\nBut this protection comes at a price. She is cut off from the wellspring of her own kind, adrift in a sea of unfamiliar faces. And the lie takes root, twisting and blooming into something unforeseen. Olivia, blinded by the illusion, falls for her charade, mistaking the man for a man. \n\nAnd Orsino, he too, is caught in the web. A love unspoken, a yearning for something beyond reach, fueled by the masquerade. But is it the man that Olivia desires, or something deeper, a hidden truth she cannot name?  Perhaps, in the shadow play of Twelfth Night, Shakespeare shows us the way our own desires can be shaped by the masks we wear. He reveals the fragility of truth, the way it can be both a source of pain and a catalyst for understanding.\n\nOlivia, she moves quickly from one illusion to another, a fickle heart swayed by appearances.  In the end, she sees Viola not as a lover, but as a sister, a bond forged in the crucible of deception.  And so, the play leaves us with a question: what are we willing to sacrifice for love, for truth, for a semblance of self?",
            "The stain of the Reich stretched long and dark across the African sun.  The slaughter of the Ovaherero and Nama, a reckoning etched in blood, stood as a testament to the brutality of their rule.  But empires, like men, are not simple beasts.  The German dominion, sprawled across the continent, wore many faces.  Its policies, like the shifting sands, varied with the winds of place. Education, a flickering candle in the vast darkness, burned with different intensities in each.\n\nWhen the British came, inheriting the husk of German East Africa, they found a people touched by knowledge, literate souls walking in the sun.  In Kamerun, and other shadowed corners of the empire, whispers spoke of the Germans' efforts, their attempts to bring light to the darkness.  But in South West Africa, a different tale unfolded.  A land where the government, with a cold indifference, left the fate of native education to the meager ministrations of missionaries.  \n\nEuropeans, the favored sons, were ushered into the halls of learning, their education nurtured and controlled by the state's iron hand.  The natives, however, remained shrouded in ignorance, the vast majority untouched by the glow of knowledge.  This disparity, a scar upon the land, lingered long after the Reich had crumbled. Other colonies boasted a people awakened, literate and empowered. South West Africa, however, remained trapped in the grip of darkness.\n\nThis paper seeks to unravel the threads that bind this history, to shed light upon the reasons for this divergence.  It delves into the attitudes of the settlers, the whispers of the colonial authorities, and the social, political, and economic forces that shaped the destiny of a people.\n\nThe study of German colonial education is a vast and intricate tapestry, woven from primary sources in the German tongue, penned in the twilight of the empire.  These early works sought to document the shape of education in the colonies, to illuminate the workings of a system both complex and contradictory.  Later writings, in the English tongue, expanded the discourse, comparing the educational landscapes of the various colonies and dissecting the nuances of their practices.  Cohen, in his seminal work, cast a critical eye upon the educational systems of both South West Africa and East Africa, drawing a stark contrast.  He argues that the settler population, a tide of white desires, shaped the distinct features of South West Africa's educational system.\n\n\nThe land itself, a canvas of arid desert and temperate plains, offered a relative respite from the scorching heat of other colonies. This, in turn, attracted a steady influx of European settlers, swelling their numbers to nearly fifteen thousand by 1913.  In East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population, the numbers paled in comparison, a mere five thousand souls.",
            "The classification of Popular Music, a tangled web spun over a century, now encompasses a multitude of genres so numerous they defy easy listing. Each, from rap to rock, country to jazz, folk and beyond, gives birth to subgenres and sub-subgenres, a sprawling, ever-branching family tree.  Heavy metal, a child of rock, has emerged in the past forty years as a genre of remarkable diversity and expression. Its music, a tempest of sound, channels a spectrum of emotions, though often veering toward the shadowed recesses of the human heart. \n\nFrom its nascent days, metal's flexibility was evident. Bands, drawn to its power, began carving out their own niches, spawning subgenres in turn, each a reflection of its own particular vision. And so the chain continues, a labyrinth of sound where the boundaries blur, and the question arises: what, precisely, is heavy metal?\n\nIt has become a chameleon, absorbing elements from other genres, yet its origins remain a vital touchstone. To truly understand the metal that reverberates today, one must first trace its lineage, for it is more than a mere genre—it is a movement, a force that has reshaped the landscape of music.\n\nMetal is, in many ways, a child of darkness. A \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more raw power, more theatricality. Less innocence, more virtuosity. The musicians, masters of their instruments, wield their craft with a precision that pierces the soul.\n\nAnd there's a darkness that seeps into its very core, a darkness born of the psychedelic drug boom of the mid-seventies, a time when minds expanded and boundaries blurred.  The music, infused with the otherworldly, became a conduit for the experiences, both joyful and terrifying, that these substances wrought. Metal's visceral qualities, a stark departure from the prevailing pop music of the era, tapped into a primal wellspring of emotion, echoing the dark, brooding themes of the Romantic era.\n\nLyrics, sharp as daggers, capture this essence:\n\n\nThese words, from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" expose the darker side of the Fab Four. A song of highs and lows, a reflection of the drug-induced haze, it is considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response, a challenge, to the Rolling Stones' own foray into heavier, darker territory. The Beatles, proving they could match the Stones' intensity, unleashed this sonic beast upon the world in their iconic \"White Album.\"",
            "The Surrealists were yet to come, their canvases bleeding with dreams. But long before, Henri Rousseau, alone in his studio, was crafting his own. Not just on canvas, but in the marrow of his bones. The Dream, 1910. A woman, eyes wide, bathed in the light of some strange, inner world.  And Rousseau himself, trapped in the labyrinth of his own striving. \n\nRecognition. Acceptance. The whisper of praise from those who knew the language of paint. A hunger gnawed at him, a yearning to be seen. But the world of art, cold and unforgiving, demanded conformity. To sculpt his dreams into the mold of expectation, or to stand apart, a lone figure in a howling wilderness? \n\nThis was the battle raging within him, a battle painted across the years. \n\nRousseau, born in the small town of Laval, was no child of privilege. His father, a tinsmith, his world a hard-scrabble existence.  No lessons in the academies, no gilded whispers of patronage. He toiled as a toll collector, a gabelou, his days measured out in the rhythm of passing carts and coins. Then, a cruel blow: the deaths of his wife and eight children, leaving only a daughter, Julia, to bind him to the world. He sought solace in paint, a language he learned by heart, a refuge from the ache in his soul.\n\nHe wasn't like the others, the artists who romanticized the peasant, the simple folk. He was one of them, his dreams as rooted in the soil as the wheat fields that stretched beyond his window. He knew the hunger, the yearning for something more than the daily grind. \n\nAnd so, he painted.\n\nBut the world of art, a jungle of talent and ambition, offered little comfort. Matisse rose, a comet streaking across the sky, while Rousseau remained in the shadows. He longed to be seen, to be welcomed into the fold, to be more than just a douanier with a brush.\n\n\"Matisse feared the trite,\" wrote Jan Gordon, \"while Rousseau desired the conventional, the accepted,\" a desperate yearning to be deemed worthy.",
            "The men of thought, they've pondered it long. This thing, this kinship between the right and the beautiful. Between truth and the eye's delight. Keats, he knew it, said it plain. \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—\" That's all you know on this earth, and all you need to know.\n\nWe learn, we're taught. Facts and figures, how to live in this world. But ethics, aesthetics, these things they seep into you. Not through lessons, but through the marrow. Like a wind that blows through the trees, shaping them, whispering secrets.  \n\nWe study art, we dissect it. We weigh morality, try to pin it down. But it's a slippery thing. Like smoke, it eludes our grasp. We talk of foreground, of shadow and light, of context. Yet these words, they fall short.  There's something else, something that lingers. A ghost in the machine, as it were.\n\nA favorite book, a piece of music that stirs the soul. We struggle to explain it. \"There's just something about it,\" we say. And it's true. There's a something that transcends the words, the brushstrokes, the notes. A hollowness, an ache, a longing.\n\nIt's the same with morals. We can lay out the rules, the dos and don'ts. But the heart, the soul, it knows a different kind of truth. A truth that can't be contained, can't be explained.\n\nLiterature, now that's a thing apart. It's the closest we come to touching this other world.  McKean, he understood it. \"Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"\n\nMorality and art, they're two sides of the same coin. They speak to us on a level deeper than words. They touch the soul, the very core of who we are.",
            "The Germany of now, a fist clenched in the world's hand. A nation forged in the shadow of the Alps, a chill wind blowing from München to the salt spray of Kiel. The same blood runs through Köln's veins on the Rhine, through the heart of the land, to Dresden, a city cradled by the Elbe. It's a tapestry woven from disparate threads, a culture spun from the whispers of tribes long gone.\n\nGermania. The name itself a ghost, a whisper echoing through the ages. Scholars, they scratch and claw at its meaning, but the truth lies buried deep. Tacitus, he claimed it belonged to the Tungrians, a people who crossed the Rhine, their swords singing a song of war against the Gauls. (Tacitus, 98.) Caesar, that butcher of men, he first used the word \"Germanus,\" a label to distinguish the conquered Gauls from those who held fast to their land. Taken from the Gauls themselves, a word meant to mark the difference, the line between victors and the vanquished. Some say it came from the Gaulish tongue, a word for neighbor, a word turned weapon. Caesar, in his own blood-soaked chronicle, writes of them: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others whisper of the spear, the \"ger,\" a weapon wielded in the heart of battle. Or perhaps from the Old Irish word, \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" a testament to their fierce voices that echoed across the plains. (Names of Germany)\n\nTacitus, his pen a scalpel dissecting history, wrote in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" a testament to the origins of these people. \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nRome, a colossus, looked upon Germania with a cold curiosity. They sought its riches, its furs, its amber. They sent their legions, their swords tasting the blood of the Germanic tribes, but Rome, in the end, turned its gaze elsewhere. The tribes, they lived on the edges, trading their wares, their skills, their blood in the ranks of the Roman legions. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "The pit yawned open below. I looked in.  Mind a blank slate, the picture etched itself there.  No emotion, no judgment. Just the cold, clear gaze of a thing seeing.  Thoughts, wisps of smoke, rose and vanished in the stillness.  The world flowed through me, a river of light and shadow. No thoughts of my own, just the current.\n\nOnce, an artist I knew, his eyes like chips of flint, told me of a book, *The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain*.  He said it taught you to see. To see the way a pencil moved, the way the world itself was made of lines.  He said to frame your vision, box it in, until all that was left was the essence. A bowl of fruit, not a kitchen, not a life.  Just the bowl.\n\nThe bowl before me now. I could not frame it.  It choked me, suffocated me.  Picasso with his blues, Monet with his greens, the Italians with their riot of colors.  This was my palette, the brown of the earth, the brown of decay.  Work in Brown, I thought.\n\nMy fingers brushed the cold porcelain. Muscles tensed, then slacked.  The will to shape, to mold, to create.  The water, a mirror of the sky, calm and deep.  A flake, a whisper, a moment of detachment.  Muscles tightened, a struggle, a spasm.  The handle slammed down.  Nothing.  A stubborn knot, a lump of defiance.\n\nMop in hand, tie a noose around my throat, I stared.  A message, scrawled in brown ink.  More flushes, more silence.  Then, the paper.  A slow, deliberate movement, wrapping, concealing.  Like a grave digger, preparing the earth.  My hand plunged in, a mother gathering her child.",
            "The young ones are dying behind the wheel.  A confluence of things, a tangle of roots, brings them to this reckoning. The Institutes, they say, the brain ain't fully formed yet.  Not ready for the reckoning of the road. And inexperience, that's the heart of it.  A raw nerve that bleeds out in fatal crashes, in vehicles rolled like dying beasts, in reckless speed and the edge of the asphalt.\n\nThey're worse, these young ones, with their kind amongst them.  A fact known to any man with a lick of sense.  The Center in California, they studied it, the age of the passenger and the accidents they brought.  A grim dance.\n\nStates, they try.  Provisional licenses, they call 'em.  Hours limited, friends kept at bay.  But these are just bandages on a gunshot wound.  The truth is, they ain't ready.  Not by the numbers. Not by the cold, hard facts.  Doctor Zuckerman, he says it plain.  Eighteen, too young.  The young ones, they crave the rush, the thrill of the edge.  It's in their blood.  Delay the wheel, he says, let the hunger fade.\n\nWe keep handing out licenses, though.  And the dead pile up.  More soon, when the boomers' children come of age. Millions of them, hungry for the road.  A reckoning waits.\n\nThe law, it ain't hard to write.  Schools, they can teach, but no hands on the wheel 'til eighteen.  A permit, maybe, and hours behind the wheel with a guide.  Six hours, fifty hours, the numbers are already there.  Across the states, a uniform law, a national shield.\n\nNot a new idea, no.  But maybe, just maybe, it's time we made it real.",
            "The Library of Congress, a monument to the dead past, housed a collection of Edison's early films. I set out to watch them all, fifteen or so, from the waning years of the century to the dawning of the new. Trick films, they were called, illusions conjured by the cut and splice of celluloid. My study leaned toward the poetics of these tricks, the common thread that wove them together, and the few that dared to break free, to stray from the path.  \n\nMostly, these early films were bound to the stage, confined within a frame as rigid as a proscenium. The camera, a silent observer, never moved. It held its ground, a drone in the eye, capturing the world in long shots, medium shots, never a close-up. The one-shot rule held true, each idea, each flicker, captured in a single, unbroken take.\n\nThe set, the stage, it was always there, a constricting presence. Figures moved side to side, like marionettes on strings, never approaching or receding, never truly leaving the frame.  Look at \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" a phantom from 1900. The actors, shadows in the gloom, step in from the right, vanish into the darkness, but the camera, unblinking, holds its gaze.\n\nThe proscenium, a cage, dictated the form. The audience, like spectators in a darkened theater, saw the whole world at once, framed by the edges of the stage.  The actors, tethered to the middle ground, never breached the boundaries. Close-up, intimacy, a foreign concept.\n\nEach film, a single idea, a single shot, told in a minute or less.  A glimpse, a trick, a vanishing act, a story whispered and gone. But be wary, for the illusion is a lie. What appears as a single shot may be many, stitched together, a tapestry woven from fragments. Look closer at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" a relic from 1895.  The severed head, a phantom flicker, a trick of the light, a joining of disparate moments.",

A man made by the land, he saw the government then as a reflection of that land, and in his mind, the land was best left untamed, fiercely independent. He spoke of republics, of rights, of a Constitution meant to be a fence, not a cage. He believed in the nature of man, the darkness and the light, and that a government too strong would only fan those flames. He saw the dangers of a hungry power, a government swollen by ambition, and he saw the virtue in the simple life, the life of the farmer, the life lived close to the earth. The Declaration, he said, was the real testament, a whisper of sovereignty from the heart of the nation. A nation of states, not a single, monolithic whole. He wanted the government small, its reach limited, its touch light, lest it smother the very thing it sought to protect.",
            "The chart, Figure Seventeen, tells a story. A stark drop in commuter logs the third month in. A discouragement, to be sure. Why this fall? Winter's bite had settled on the New England bones. Fewer souls walking or pedaling to class. December, the semester's end, a flurry of grades and deadlines. The log, a forgotten thing in the clamor. Then the holidays, that long shadow swallowing the campus, students and faculty dispersed. January, a slow awakening, classes stirring. Still, February, the logs remained scant. \n\nPerhaps the initial spark, that first burst of interest, had faded. A natural thing, maybe. So they built a Carpool Challenge Week, a firestorm in March, to reignite the flame. It worked, the logs climbed again. But the challenge remained: to hold the light against the winter of disengagement, against the cycles of school and season.\n\nAnother challenge: the allure of the car, an ingrained hunger for freedom, for the open road. A cultural beast. To lure them away, you need bait. They offered trinkets, gift cards to coffee shops and bookstores, even massages. But what of bigger prizes?

The prizes remained the same, a meager offering against the siren song of the engine. \n\nWhat if the prizes, like the winter sky, grew brighter?

Like a stock, it moves on the boards, bought and sold in a flash.  But within that cage, a whole world. Diversification, they promise, spread thin against risk. Yet, a closer look reveals a price to pay. A commission for each trade, a toll to cross the threshold.\n\nThere are whispers, too, of expense ratios, lower than the old mutual funds, but still a weight on the scales. And the question lingers: does this cage truly offer the spread promised? Does owning a single ETF truly mirror the spread of a hand-picked portfolio?\n\nWe'll take IHF, a cage of its own, and examine its contents. The ten strongest holdings, they say, make up  more'n sixty percent of the cage's worth.  We'll compare these ten, these individual souls, to the cage itself. Will they sing the same song? Will their returns match the cage's, or will they offer a different tune altogether?  \n\nWe'll speak in numbers, in terms of Beta and Return, the metrics of the trade. But remember, numbers can lie.

            "Dream-land. One of Poe's own words, he called it a better poem. In it, he speaks of Thulé, a word echoed twice, like a ghost, in lines six and fifty-six. Mabbott traces it back to Virgil, the old man who wrote of an island north of Britain, a place the Greeks reckoned the world's edge. Virgil, he used it, that's for sure. But there's a newer whisper, a breath from across the sea, a German wind. Poe, he had eyes for those writers, spoke their tongue in his own way.\n\nKarl J. Arndt, in his book, he lays it out plain: Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon. The echo there, Arndt says, is more than a passing fancy. Poe, he was mimicking the master.\n\nOxford, they speak of Goethe, a writer celebrated for his Faust, a play in two parts, the first born in eighteen-oh-eight, the second in the year of his dying, eighteen-thirty-two. And within that second part, a poem sings, \"The King of Thulé.\" A king, his queen gone, the gift of a goblet, now a tomb in his hand. He drinks, he weeps, remembers. Then, a hollow echo in his heart, he knows his time is come. He gives his all to his children, keeps the goblet, a cold comfort. To the cliff he walks, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and follows it down, down, down.\n\nThe King of Thulé, Poe's dreamer, a shadow, maybe, of loss, of a bottle's hollow embrace. Faust, it was made into a play, a drama of shadows by H.P. Grattan in eighteen-forty-two, a year before Poe's own dark use of the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nTwice in his own words, Poe speaks of Thulé. \"Ulma Thule\" in the Pendulum, a whisper. But in \"Dream-land,\" it hangs, a bookend, twice repeated. \"The King of Thulé,\" \"Dream-land,\" they stand together, companions in the dark. In \"Dream-land,\" the speaker walks the landscape of Thulé, a place of shadows, of loneliness, ghosts whispering at his heel, a world drained of color.  Goethe's poem, the king's grief, his emptiness, his world turned to ash, it's all there, mirrored in Poe's words.\n\nGoethe, he was a giant, a writer Poe couldn't help but know, even if only for the sake of Tennyson.  \"I admire Tennyson,\" Poe said, and behind that, a world of echoes, of shared words and borrowed dreams.",
            "The law in this godforsaken state holds that a man who slips on a spilled jar of applesauce, his bones brittle and his life laid out like a map of misery, might find some measure of justice in the coin of punitive damages. The question hangs heavy: can a man claim such recompense when the manager, a man named Martin, turned a blind eye to the slick trail of fruit, twice warned of its treachery?\n\nThe judge, a hardened soul forged in the fires of a thousand petty disputes, ain't likely to toss this claim out with the morning's trash. To win such damages, the plaintiff, a woman named Palmer, must show that Martin's actions weren't just negligent, but steeped in a willful disregard for the fate of his customers.  She'll argue that Martin knew, or should have known, the danger. The years before were stained with the blood of other spills, other broken bodies. He'd heard the cries, seen the fallen, yet still he chose the comfort of his supper over the safety of his store. Whether his actions are truly \"despicable,\" a word that tastes like ash on the tongue, is a matter for the jury to decide.\n\nThe facts are cold and stark. On a day in October, a man named Wayne, a servant in Martin's domain, brought word of the spilled applesauce. Martin, his belly full of the bounty of the earth, offered only a dismissive shrug. Another servant, Haddigan, came bearing the same news, but Martin's ears were deaf to her pleas.  And then came Palmer, her life shattered on the slick floor, her back a twisted monument to Martin's indifference.\n\nThe law, a labyrinth of words and precedents, offers a sliver of hope for the injured. It speaks of malice, of a disregard for human life that borders on cruelty. It whispers of punishment, of a reckoning for the man who turns a blind eye to the suffering of others.",
            "Four years gone now since I sat in that classroom at CBC, the air thick with the dust of scripture and the friction of belief.

The world, spit from the fire of 9/11, had watched the media shift its gaze, from the scorn of suspicion to a blanket of uneasy acceptance. A name like Barack Obama, a name that echoed with the murmur of a distant faith, could scarcely have been uttered in the year 2001.\n\nThe Prophet’s story, it drew me in, not for its glory, but for the dissonance it held. I’d been taught of conquest, of tribes forced under the yoke of Islam, their voices stifled by the sword. Yet the biography painted a different picture, a man humbled, misunderstood, a martyr even. People drawn to him, not by force, but by a conviction that bloomed slowly, like a flower in the desert.\n\nThere are echoes in the stories, whispers of the miracles wrought by Jesus. The multiplying mutton and milk, a feast made from nothing. A narrative spun to paint Muhammad as a man of unwavering faith, untouched by the need for worldly validation. A shadow falls across this, a suspicion that the sun of Christ’s divinity is being eclipsed by a borrowed light.\n\nAnd the witnesses, their voices echoing through generations, filtered through the haze of hearsay. A chain of whispers, each link growing flimsier, the truth obscured.\n\nPerhaps the most unsettling aspect is the attempt to elevate Muhammad, to cast him as a godlike figure, gentle, wise, compassionate. History, however, tells a different tale, a tale of a man forged in the fires of ambition. I wonder, do those who follow him today know the truth, the weight of the past?",
            "The words the man called Jesus spoke, the truths he held dear, were cast aside like chaff on the wind the moment he was gone.  The cloth of Christian thought, once woven with his threads, took on a life of its own, twisting and turning, straying further from its source with every passing generation. The world, it seems, marches ever onward, a procession of progress, a relentless tide of change. The old ways cling, sure, like barnacles to a hull, but they are few and brittle. They cannot hold back the rising tide. There will come a time, a reckoning, when the dust settles and the true heart of the matter is revealed. A yearning will rise, a hunger to strip away the layers of dogma, to see the man behind the myth, the words behind the pronouncements. It will be a long road, paved with centuries perhaps, but the path is set. The clock will turn backward, unwinding the centuries of accretion, until only the bare bones of Jesus' message remain. And when this tide washes over the land, drowning the false idols in its wake, the church itself, that ancient edifice, will stand strong, a beacon in the returning darkness. But the faith it guards will be transformed. The vast, splintered multitude of Christendom will coalesce, drawn together by a single, unwavering faith. The differences that have plagued them for centuries will fade, swallowed by the rising tide. This is the way of things, the way of history. It is the cycle of empires, the pendulum swing. From persecution to power, from darkness to light, from slavery to freedom. And now, it will turn once more, on the altar of faith. The great reversion is coming, a return to the source, a stripping bare of the soul. And to make this possible, the words of Jesus will be read anew, not as pronouncements from on high, but as whispers from the heart, metaphors for a deeper truth.\n\nSo tell me, what has transpired since the day he walked this earth? What has been added, what has been lost? \n\nLook back through the mists of time, and you will find only Judaism, the seed from which Christianity sprouted.  The belief in a single God, the authority of the scriptures, the revelation of a divine will. These were the pillars upon which the faith stood when the Romans set their foot on Jerusalem in the year of our Lord 63 BC. But even then, the children of Israel were not one. They were divided, fractured into sects - Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots - and the common folk who straddled the line between.",
            "The belly of the beast. That's what Sinclair called it. The Jungle. And inside, men were no different than the animals they slaughtered. Greed. That was the root. It choked the air, thickened the blood, turned men's hearts to rust. The factory owners, men with eyes like cold steel, they saw only the bottom line. The smoke that poured from their chimneys, black as a sinner's soul, it was the breath of their hunger. They cared nothing for the men they chewed up and spit out, the women and children too frail to stand against the machine.  \n\nSinclair paints a picture, stark and unforgiving. Buildings like tombstones against the sky. Rivers of smoke, a shroud over the land.  The stench of death, of blood and offal, clung to everything. The men, their faces etched with grime and despair, they were shadows in the machine, cogs in a wheel grinding them down.\n\n\"From top to bottom,\" Sinclair wrote, \"a seething cauldron.\" No loyalty, no decency. Just the cold, hard currency of dollars. They stole their lives. Their sweat, their blood, their very breath. And when they were spent, discarded, they were left to rot in the muck of Packingtown.\n\nEven the unions, those supposed bastions of hope, they were but another hand reaching into the till.  Only the masters profited, the wolves in fine suits. The workers, they were trapped, slaves to a system that devoured them whole. Their cries, lost in the roar of the machines, echoed the emptiness of their souls.",
            "The telling of a story, it ain't just words on a page. It's the feel you leave the reader with, the taste in their mouth. Some writers, they know this. Fitzgerald, he knew it good. He built worlds with words, not just told them. He'd take a word, an image, and twist it, make it mean more than it did on the surface.\n\nColors, he used them like that. Gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. Each one a whisper, a hint. He built meaning into them, slow and sure, like a house being brick by brick. White, he used for the pretty kind of things, the high class, the kind that fades with time. Gray, it was the opposite. Older, tired, worn down.\n\nHe'd sprinkle them through the story, white chins and gray faces, white roads and gray skies. Even the names of folks at Gatsby's parties, they were just gray smudges on a list. He'd paint with these colors, making the reader see the world through his eyes, feel the dust of the valley, the chill of the gray houses.\n\nAnd then, when you least expect it, he'd use those colors to tell you something. Like Daisy, she was a white blur, a ghost in a white dress. A beautiful thing, maybe, but empty.  A white void, something Gatsby chased after but couldn't reach.\n\nFitzgerald, he knew how to use words. He knew how to make you feel.",
            "The sun baked San Diego County, coaxing life from the soil. Tomatoes plumped, citrus hung heavy, a sea of green from leafy greens and squash stretching as far as the eye could see. Broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers—all grew fat and sweet under the endless sky. A hunger for the clean, the natural, pulsed through the region. Organic food, a bounty from the earth untainted, was in demand. Community Supported Agriculture, letters carried on the wind from farm to table, had waiting lists stretching long as the desert shadows. Eggs and milk, organic and fresh, were sought after treasures. Farms, some open to the public, beckoned with tours, paths winding through the rows, birdsong a constant symphony. This was the kind of farm the land could bear, a place to honor the soil, to draw profit from the earth's bounty while keeping the wild things safe. A place where the government's hand could lend aid, not to stifle, but to nurture, where education and recreation could bloom alongside the crops.\n\nBut the path of the organic farmer is not paved with gold. It demands a different kind of toil, a constant vigilance. Weeds and pests, they come like shadows, and the chemicals that banish them are not options here. The soil must be coaxed, nurtured, and the yield, it is often smaller. The small farm, it lacks the scale, the economy of the giants, but in its heart beats the rhythm of a different kind of wealth.\n\nBiodiversity, a tapestry of life, thrives where chemicals are banished. The earth breathes easier, the creatures find solace. But the cost, it is borne by the hands that labor, the sweat that stains the brow. Cover crops, grazing managed with care, the fight against invasive species—all these things demand time, attention, and a labor of love.\n\nAnd so, the landowner in this story, he stands at a crossroads. He sees the potential, the promise of a land that yields both profit and life. But the path is not easy. He needs help, guidance, a hand to steady his steps.\n\nThe land itself, a tapestry woven from chaparral, the whispers of Mediterranean grasses, and the stoic presence of oak woodlands, lies just beyond the town of Potrero. It is a piece of the East County Southern Foothills, a realm where the Cleveland National Forest stretches out like a green embrace.  This land, it is part of a larger story, a conservation plan that seeks to protect the dwindling creatures, the kangaroo rat, the yellow-legged frog, the butterflies with wings of stained glass, the gnatcatcher, a songbird with a fragile voice.   \n\nThis land has known many lives. The ancient ones, the whispers of Native Americans, long before the trail of the cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers carved its way into the landscape.  Homestead claims, grants from a past long gone, a legacy of grazing, of wood, a whisper of what was and what could be again.  \n\nA piece of property, found on a screen, a map of possibilities. Research, a search for the tools, the programs, the hands that could help shape this land into a haven. An example, a model of what could be, a farm in the same region, already living the dream.",
            "Culture. A shadowed thing. As much what it ain't as what it is. Not some uniform cloth stitched tight. Not a single thread. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, that's a fool's cartography.  A map drawn with broad strokes, ignorance bleeding into the lines.  Understand the weight of a culture, sure, how it sits like a stone in the belly of a man. How it shapes the talk at the table. \n\nWhen you walk into a strange land, you see it through the lens of your own. Comparisons rise, like smoke from a fire. To know a foreign mind, you gotta dig deep. Into history, into the dark corners of its prejudices.  Don't judge. Don't try to change it. Accept it, the good and the bad. Work within its bones. Especially when you're at the table with a weaker hand. \n\nCulture ain't just bound by nations. It whispers in the halls of corporations too. Some places, the hours stretch long, the hours bleed into the night. Others, they move at a gentler pace. You see it in the way they dress, the words they choose, who they give power to. Some places, charity is a prayer whispered in the heart. Others, it's a ledger book, entries marked with the company's approval. Even in America, the heart of a company can beat different rhythms,  from city to town, from corner office to factory floor. \n\nValues. That's the heart of it.  The why. If saving face is sacred, a man won't break his own to win a deal. If hard bargaining is the creed, he won't back down easy. \n\nKnow these things before you sit down at the table. But more than that, know the man across from you.  Look into his eyes.  That's where the real deal is made.",
            "The fool, he’d said it in his heart. \"There is no God.\" A line from the Psalms, they say, the book of psalms. A starting point for Anselm, that man, in his talk of a God. And Aquinas, he too held fast to this belief. Both men, wrestling with the same notion, the same God, the God of the Book. To compare them, we must first presume their ground is true, that God is, that he is the God they speak of. \n\nBut what is this God? And does he need proving?\n\nAnselm, he looked inward. Found God in the mind. Said that to conceive of his nonexistence was impossible. A tangled web, his words, but the thread was clear: the proof of God lies within. No need to seek him in the world, he said, only look to what the mind already knows. A kind of faith, this, a leap into the dark.\n\nAquinas, he went a different way. He sought proof in the world, in the things that could be seen and touched. Five arguments he laid out, like stones on a path: change, cause and effect, the fact that things are not eternal, the gradation of goodness, and the harmony of the universe. He said that logic itself pointed to God, that the existence of the world demanded a maker.\n\nBoth men, seeking the same truth, but by different roads. But do they truly reach it? Or is it just a shadow, a reflection in the mind?",
            "The prince, he'd be known as Buddha some day. Born in the dusk of the fifth or sixth century before the reckoning. He cast off the world, found the light, and his words took root, blooming into Buddhism. The Theravada strain, the oldest branch, still clings to the roots. Yet it's a different world now, two and a half thousand years on. Look to Sri Lanka, a land of Theravada, where they cut the water each year in a ceremony. Monks and men, shoulder to shoulder. A ritual, no doubt, but one Buddha never spoke of.  The changes seep in, from the skin of the tradition to its bone. The Theravada people, both the robed and the lay, have had to bend and shift, their doctrines like driftwood in a tide.\n\nThere are forces at play, shaping the current. Inside forces, from those who walk the Buddhasasana path, whether cloaked or free. Outside forces, those from beyond the fold. Hostile forces, aiming to wound or break the community, born of spite or misunderstanding. And benign forces, indifferent to the river's flow, though they may leave a ripple in their wake. These forces, they'll echo through this telling.\n\nFirst, the heart of the matter: the doctrines that hold Theravada firm.  Refuge is sought in the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma, the teachings, are gathered in the Tripitaka, three baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka, the words of Buddha himself. The Vinaya Pitaka, the rules for living, the way of the monk and the lay. And lastly, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the depths of being, where truths like Anatta—no soul—and Dukkha—the sting of life—and Anicca—the ever-changing world—are held. Only by knowing these can one escape Sansara, the endless wheel of birth and death. And with it, lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion—will fade, leaving only enlightenment.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka lays out the path for all. Five precepts for the lay: no killing, no lying, no stealing, no lust, no intoxicants. For the monks, a more intricate web of rules, a tighter leash.  But at the core, the Four Noble Truths. Life is Dukkha, that's the first. Attachment fuels the fire of suffering, the second. But there's a way out, the third. And the fourth: the path to freedom lies in the Eightfold Path.",
            "The land of the Egyesült Államok and Mexico, two nations bound by a shared border, were once locked in a long-held feud. A feud that stretched like a serpent's shadow, from 1836 to the year 1893, a span of fifty-seven years. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  The high tide of this conflict crested with the Mexican-American War, a storm of steel and fire from 1846 to 1848. The north, the Egyesült Államok, struck, and Mexico fell. Texas and the Southwest, lands rich with promise, were claimed for the victor. But skirmishes, smaller fires in the long night, continued to flicker between the two nations, fading finally on the eve of the Great War. \n\nThe roots of this bitterness ran deep, tangled in the soil of differing faiths, customs, and ways of life.  Material interests, too, clashed, a grinding friction that set the two nations at odds. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This dance of rivalry is not unique. Nations sharing a boundary, their fates intertwined, often find themselves locked in a struggle for dominance. Like echoes in the canyons, the United States and Mexico mirrored the jealousies and ambitions of nations wedged together by geography.  As Pletcher (1977) observed, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). These nations, close in proximity, stood as rivals, while others in the south basked in a more amicable sun.\n\nReligion, a potent force, cast a shadow over the relationship.  Frahm (2001) reminds us, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  Like the Cold War, a clash of ideologies, the tensions between the United States and Mexico were woven from both belief and self-interest. Yet, the battleground was not political, but spiritual, a struggle over the soul of nations. This suspicion, born of the old world, lingered.  The English and Spanish, their shadows stretching back centuries, had sown the seeds of distrust, a legacy that poisoned the well of diplomacy.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalogued seventeen disputes between the two nations,  a litany of grievances stretching over fifty-seven years. Most were territorial skirmishes, echoes of the border wars: raids from one side into the other, outlaws seeking refuge in the lawless spaces between.  Bandits and lawbreakers, their motives as tangled as the barbed wire fences, fueled the flames of conflict.  It wasn't until both nations, weary of the endless struggle, committed their armies to the border that the violence finally receded. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) argues that the rivalry waned as Mexico, like a supplicant, found itself increasingly reliant on the north.  By the late nineteenth century, the Egyesült Államok’s ambitions shifted from conquest to economic control, their sights fixed on the riches of Mexico. And so, the long-held feud, like a dying ember, finally flickered out. (p. 109, p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years gone now. A sickness came on sudden, unexpected. A thing I'd never known. I was a nurse then.  A trade chosen out of a need for the kind of security I'd lacked as a boy.  \"You'll always be needed,\" they'd said. \"Folks always get sick.\" A mantra hammered home from adolescence on. So I took to the wards, even though the dream had been a different kind.  Science, maybe.  Journalism.  A little of both, if you please. But the dream, well, it faded.\n\nThen came the fall. Forty-six years on this earth, single, no savings to speak of, and the work, it left me. Still does. Fifteen years of living on what the government allows, and I'm left with nothing.  Nothing that's truly mine. I make do, but each day is a fight, a gnawing at the edges of my security, my safety, my pride.  Nothing certain anymore except this: I wouldn't have made it without the hand of my family, a few good souls.  And let me tell you, when the real disaster strikes,  strength ain't much more than a whisper.\n\nLife throws you curves, big and small.  No guarantees. No matter how you plan, there are things too vast to face alone. \n\nThey talk about small government, the \"rugged individualism\" that built this land.  But truth is, what got our forefathers through wasn't grit, it was the helping hand, the shared load, the kindness between men.  Those pioneers who crossed the Rockies, they didn't do it alone. They relied on each other.\n\nSo yes, be prepared.  I am.  Got my kit: flashlight, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods.  Water tablets, plastic sheeting for the windows, just in case.  If you've got the land, the means, a small farm, can your own food.  A wood stove, if you're lucky enough to have a place for it.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors. That's the real strength.",
            "The why of things. The turning of the forms. Why do they take the shape they do?  Are there unseen hands guiding them, constraints upon their becoming?  D’Arcy Thompson spoke of it long ago, a truth still felt in the marrow: \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\"  True enough then, and true now.  \n\nBut the tools have sharpened.  Mathematical models, they've been applied to the making of the shells, the skeletogenesis of the mollusks, through the crawling of time, the ontogeny, and the branching of lineage, the phylogeny.  Raup and Stanley, they laid it out back in '81.  \n\nOur work, it probes this further.  Using the Prunum, a spiral of the sea, we seek to understand what forces shape its form, the direction and measure of its change.  We took X-rays, peering into the bones, drawing lines of measurement, feeding them into the belly of the machine, CerioShell, a program spun from code. We spun models, hypothetical forms, ghosts of shells yet to be, to see the edges of what is possible.  These we marry with the flesh and blood, the living study, to pierce the veil of time, to see the grand sweep of change in this lineage.\n\nA shell, it's a tube, a journey through three hundred and sixty degrees of space, a spiral unwinding. Each turn, a whorl, spiraling around a central axis, the columella.  The speed of this unwinding, it varies. A suture, a scar, marks the path between whorls.  The last whorl, the body whorl, it's the grandest, the final flourish. The rest, the spire, a silent symphony of turns. The apex, the tip, points skyward.  The base, the opposite end, rests upon the earth.  And through an aperture, a mouth, the creature emerges.\n\nWe look at the shell from above, from below, from the front, from the back.  The aperture, it's the face, the window to the world.  We count the whorls, tracing the line of the suture, dividing the shell, measuring the journey.\n\nA shell, it's a story told in space and time. Each whorl, a chapter, a moment captured.  We can chart its path, the center of each aperture, the radius of its span, and write its story in the language of numbers.\n\nAnd with this language, we can twist the threads, change the parameters, and see how the form might shift, how evolution dances its intricate dance.",
            "The death rattle of babes and babes yet unsprung had held a stubborn stillness in Indonesia these last ten years. The nation moved, it seemed, on a path toward the ghosts of promised goals: water and sanitation targets met, perhaps. But the health of mothers and children, that was a different song altogether. A song of want and hunger, sung in the language of numbers far too high, far too woeful. The reasons for this, they lie buried in the heart of the matter, in the bones of the country's own making. To mend this, a stronger spine is needed, not more patchwork remedies.\n\n72% of births now saw the face of a skilled hand, they say. But skilled is a word that holds many shades. Midwives, wise women of tradition, could not mend a womb torn asunder. Hemorrhage, the crimson flood, claimed its victims still. Progress, then, a thin veneer, a brittle shell. And the children, those small souls under five, their battles with the gut-wrenching grip of diarrhea, they fought alone more often than not. Data on the care given after birth, a shadow story, but even in its darkness, the lack of care, the absence of touch, it whispers a chilling truth.\n\nThe knife's cold kiss, the cesarean, it was rare. 4% of births bore this mark. But in the city, it danced at 7%, while in the villages, it lingered at a paltry 2%. A chasm, a gulf, between the haves and the have-nots, exposed. The lifeblood of health, it flowed in the veins of the city, leaving the countryside parched. And the poor, they were choked by the weight of coins, their pockets empty, their access to care a distant dream. A 27% gap, a canyon bridged by nothing but despair.\n\nWhat then, is the path forward? To build new programs, like towers of hope, or to strengthen the very foundations of the system itself? The siren song of quick fixes, of targeted programs, it calls. Easier to manage, to measure, to claim victory. But a house built on shifting sand, it crumbles in the wind. Resources drain, poured into one well, leaving others to wither. And the machinery of bureaucracy, it grows fat on paperwork, on forms, on an endless cycle of waste.",
            "The Victorians, they wrote of detail, of the gilded cages of their age. But two tales, they stray from the thread. *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, they whisper of shadows and strangeness. A darkness that lingers in the corners of the soul. These tales weave a mystery, a kind of fevered dream that clings to the characters, seeping into their bones. It's in the whispers of their fears, in the way their eyes betray what their words cannot. \n\nConsider this: A boy, lost in a labyrinth of his own making. *“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”* (Dickens, 220) \n\nThe boy, Oliver, adrift in a sea of pain and confusion. He is haunted by the echoes of violence, his mind a battlefield of conflicting images. He is a puppet dancing on the strings of fate, unable to control the darkness that closes in around him.\n\nThe mystery, it seeps into the dreams, into the waking hours. Like a slow poison, it unravels the fabric of reality. In *Oliver Twist*, these dreams are a glimpse into the boy's soul, a window into the horrors he has witnessed and the pain he carries within.\n\nThe shooting, it hangs over him like a shroud. A relived agony, a constant reminder of his vulnerability. He is consumed by the pain, his senses numbed to the world around him. He is a hollow shell, a ghost in his own life.\n\nThe question lingers: who is to blame? Is it the cruelty of the world, or the weakness of his own spirit? The novel leaves the answer unresolved, a haunting echo that lingers in the silence.",
            "Two years gone. I was workin' in one of them after-school programs, mindin' kids, see. Elementary age. Tried to help 'em out with whatever ailed their learnin', but English, that was my trade. Readin', writin', that was where I shone. Got pulled aside by one of the teachers, a man named Ramirez, about a boy named Adrian. Third or fourth grade, somethin' like that. Adrian, he was havin' a right mess with the readin'.\n\nAt first, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Letters, see, he'd nail some, spit 'em out clean. Others, he'd garble 'em somethin' fierce. Like he was speakin' a tongue I couldn't grasp. Knew he was Latino, that much was plain. But the boy, he spoke English like a native. Struggled on for a spell, we did. Till one day, Adrian's mama walked in. The rest of the kids were away on some field trip, leavin' me holdin' the fort with a bunch of rambunctious youngsters. Her, she didn't speak a lick of English. Just Spanish, plain and simple. Had a go at it, I did, with the little Spanish I'd picked up. Barely enough to get by. But then it hit me, like a blow to the gut: Adrian, he wasn't readin' wrong. He just didn't know the damn alphabet. Not the English one, that is.\n\nDon't know if that revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doin' better now.\n\nThat story, I tell it to show the problem of language, the walls it builds in our schools. Especially here in California, where the tongues are many. It ain't always as clear-cut as we think. Even a boy who speaks English like a bird, readin' can be a mountain he can't climb.\n\nWe all know the problem's there. So what's the fix? For Adrian, it was simple enough: a little extra help with readin', learnin' the alphabet, how the sounds come out. But for the kids who barely speak English at all, well, that's a whole other beast. Ain't no one answer. Dual language, immersion, tutors, ESL classes, none of it alone will do the trick. It's a mix, a blendin' of all those things.\n\nDual language, that's a good start. Not just for kids whose first tongue is Spanish, but for all of 'em. Studies show, kids in these kinda programs, they do better. Some folks, they fear it, say it wastes time and money. That the majority of kids won't benefit. But that's a lie. If we made these programs the rule, not the exception, every child would come out ahead.\n\nHow do we do it? Do we make every teacher bilingual?  That's a tall order, ain't it? Unrealistic, maybe. But what if we had folks, aides, tutors, somethin' like that, who spoke both tongues? That'd be a start.",
            "From the time the light first found its way into your eyes they told you there was something out there. Something vast. Something beyond the ken of man. Some were sent to the house of the Lord, others to the synagogue, others still to the silence within. Faith, a hand-me-down garment, often worn without question. But some, they tore the seams, the fabric unraveling, leaving them naked in a universe of their own making.  A universe where the only truth was the echo of their own beating heart.  And so they wandered.  Each a pilgrim searching for their own light in the dark.\n\n“A cardinal,” he said, voice rasping like wind through dry leaves. His eyes, fixed on the rain drumming on the tin roof, saw something more than the water.  Something lost. Something remembered.  The porch, shrouded in a grey mist, whispered of the things that were and the things that would be.  He was thinner now, his clothes hanging loose on his frame, a sparrow in a cage too big for him.  His hair, sparse and wispy, like the smoke from his cigarette, drifting upwards into the storm clouds.  He didn't look at me.  I sat there, the silence a heavy shroud.  Words, useless, tangled in my throat.  I reached out, a hand over his shoulder, and drew him closer.  We watched the rain, two souls caught in the current of time.\n\nHe died in December, five days after I turned twenty-two.  The doctors, they said it was a mercy.  But mercy for whom?  He lingered, a ghost in a fading light, his suffering a silent plea.  I thought then, if there was a God, he had turned his back on us both.  I said no prayers.  There was no solace in the whispers of the dead, no comfort in the words of the living.\n\nI couldn't watch him go.  Not like that.  I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he became.  I knew him better than anyone else.  He wouldn't have wanted me there.  So I stayed away.  Curled up in my bed, in the darkness, waiting for the news.  And the news never came.",
            "The Gothic, Watt called it an oxymoron, \"Old-New.\" A contradiction in terms.  Praised and damned. Shallow and profound.  A haunted mirror peering into the terrible sublime. Walpole, he built the first one, The Castle of Otranto.  Old playhouse ghosts and new world whispers, a novel born of two eras. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" \n\nThe word itself, \"Gothic.\" A whisper of the past, a stain of the old ways, a shadow of something grand and fallen. Archaic, they said. Unsophisticated.  But Walpole, he saw something else, something buried beneath the dust. He saw the drama, the spectacle, the lingering echo of a time when men were men and battles were fought with honor. He took that old world, that chivalric fire, and he poured it into the new form of the novel, where the reader walks beside the knight, feels the weight of his soul. \n\nAnd so the Gothic endures. The past, forever present.\n\nChivalry, that's the heart of it. The knight, the ideal. Brave, honorable, a shield against the darkness.  But the world, it had changed.  The old ways were fading. Walpole, he saw that. He saw the decay, the corruption. And in that decay, he saw a reflection of himself, a man caught in the storm, a witness to a world losing its way.\n\nFrederic, his knight, his hero.  He carries the weight of the past, the burden of a fallen world.  A prince, a victim, a shadow of the knight he might have been.\n\nThat's the Gothic.  A haunted house. A broken hero. A world struggling to remember its own soul.",
            "The flow of goods, a restless serpent from the point of order to the raw earth, through the forge of production, the arteries of supply, the weight of distribution, and finally to the waiting hands of the customer. The term, \"supply chain management,\" a cold coinage minted in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant in the trade, speaks of planning, of execution, and of control, all aimed at satisfying the hunger of the customer with speed and a certain grim efficiency.  Six pillars hold this chain aloft: production, supply, the hoard of inventory, the placement of facilities, the ceaseless motion of transportation, and the pulse of information. These are the tools the managers wield, striving to offer comfort to the consuming world.\n\nProduction, the first beat of the heart, is the foundation. It lays bare the when, the why, the where, and the how of creation.  Managers must know the desires of the market, for the market is a mirror reflecting the wants of the many. The murmur of demand guides their hand, dictating what will be wrought and in what quantity. Once the vision is clear, the managers turn their attention to the forge, seeking the place where the goods will take shape, where volume and quality will coalesce.  The customer's need must always be the north star.  The rhythm of work, the care of the machinery, these are the next steps, each detail a thread in the tapestry of the process. A misstep, a flaw in the design, can unravel the whole, costing time and money like a leaking vessel.   I've seen this myself, working in the great stores, Wal-Mart and Target, where each task, from the uniform of the worker to the delivery of a truckload, is meticulously outlined.  Such order ensures the smooth flow of commerce, a symphony of motion without discord.\n\nThe second pillar is supply, the lifeblood coursing through the veins of the chain. It is the art of choosing, of selecting the core capabilities of a facility, of forging partnerships with those who can offer strength and speed.  A single product may be born in many workshops, each with its own tools, its own people, its own expertise. The manager must be a weaver, threading these threads together, aligning the right division with the right process. Sometimes, the wise manager chooses to relinquish control, to outsource the work to others, seeking velocity, that elusive quality of speed and flexibility, while keeping the cost low, a tightrope walk between efficiency and expense.",
            "The sign sagged in her hand, the words a jagged script against the cardboard: Hitler is alive in Burma. Ellen Page, a face from some distant movie, stood alone on the cracked asphalt, her vigil a lonely island in the flow of indifferent traffic. Burma. Myanmar. A place where the sun beat down on a country ruled by shadows, a junta that had seized power in the dust of a coup, decades gone. \n\nThey called it the Saffron Revolution, a name that tasted of incense and blood. Monks, robed in saffron, had taken to the streets, their voices a fragile flame against the cold wind of oppression. At first, the junta had allowed them to gather, to chant their prayers, but the flame grew. The people, weary of the long night, began to join.  But the flame was not meant to burn. It was snuffed out, the streets running red with the blood of the faithful. Foreign eyes, cameras rolling, were met with the same iron fist. A Japanese man, Kenji Nagai, they said, shot dead for simply witnessing the flames.  Thirteen they said. But the desert whispers spoke of a silence deeper than death, a score that could not be counted.\n\nThis was nothing new. The hunger for power, the thirst to crush dissent, it was an old song, sung in every tongue, every time and place. The Caesars, they claimed to be gods, their will the law of the land. The emperors of Japan, those living gods, their hands stained with the ink of Motorola and the blood of hara-kiri. And here, now, in this land of cracked asphalt and broken promises, the echoes of that song still rang.\n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity yearning for a breath of freedom, drowned in a tide of tanks. The numbers danced, whispered from lips too afraid to speak. Two hundred? Two thousand? Three thousand?  Rwanda, a land consumed by hate, where neighbors turned on neighbors, the air thick with the stench of death. The Holocaust, a stain upon the soul of humanity, a testament to the depths of depravity.\n\nThe sign still hung in the air, a question mark in a world of answers. Hitler is alive in Burma. A lie, perhaps. Or a truth too terrible to bear.",
            "Duke Ellington's shadow falls long on jazz. His years, they stretched like a river, carving a sound all his own. The piano, it hums in his work, a low thrum beneath the surface, but his genius bloomed in shaping the orchestra. He built frameworks, cages of notes where soloists could fly free, and in those spaces, they shone. He wove tight tapestries of sound, drawing out the essence of each man, each instrument. Each note, a brushstroke on the canvas of the whole, painting pictures that bled into one another, new and strange. \n\nThe Grove, they call it, that book of music, they speak of his voice, his use of it as an instrument, a thing of texture and color. Creole Love Call, they say, a whisper of that.  It's a blues, slow and deliberate, twelve bars long. Six choruses, each a breath, each a step closer to the heart of the sound. A call and response, a duet between voice and reeds, smooth at first, then rough, like a turning tide. A trumpet, muted, its voice a sigh, stretching the melody, bending notes. Then a clarinet, soaring high, a fleeting bird against a backdrop of syncopated piano. The band echoes, a call and response, brass and reeds, a symphony of voices. The reeds take the lead now, high and urgent, backed by the stop-time pulse of brass and rhythm. The voice, it growls, a lonely animal, a solo instrument. A tag, a final flourish, a vocal run, a trombone's dissonance.\n\nIt's a language, this Ellingtonian sound, a conversation between instruments and voices. In Hot and Bothered, a year later, it’s there again, in the interplay between Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat.  A blending, a blurring of lines, where voice and instrument become one. In It Don't Mean a Thing, Nanton, the trombone man, he steps forward, his muted voice a dark, rich melody.",
            "The need had always been there, a hunger in the bone that no filling could satisfy. It began at fourteen, a whisper in the blood, a coming-of-age in the shadows. Three years gone and it still gnawed, though now the shape of it was clear. Not a thing, but a being. A man. Yet none of the boys, the clumsy suitors with their awkward advances, stirred anything within her. They were shadows themselves, passing through her life like smoke. She’d wrestled with this emptiness, trying to find the root of it, the cause of this barren field in her young heart. Theories bloomed and withered, leaving her with only questions. So she lived, a question mark in the vastness of her own existence.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet, like a still pond. Her parents, they were good people, calm and weathered like old oaks. Their words were rarely raised, their arguments even rarer. Their only discord was her own rebellion, her insistence on a life outside their quiet dominion. She was a storm in their gentle landscape, a whirlwind of laughter and independence, a bright spark in their calm world.\n\nBut this day, the stillness was broken. As she drifted from room to room, searching for inspiration in the mundane, a cry tore through the quiet. Her mother’s voice, thin and sharp as a broken glass. Panic gripped her, a vise around her chest. \"Mom? What is it?\"\n\nShe found her mother on the kitchen floor, crumpled like a fallen leaf. Her face contorted in pain, each breath a gasp. \"Ow…sweetheart…hospital…\" The words came in ragged bursts.\n\nHer daughter knelt beside her, a desperate hand reaching for hers. \"Okay, Mom. Where can I get you?\"\n\nHer mother's hand, clammy and weak, pointed. In that moment, the daughter felt a wellspring of strength, a fierce protectiveness. She lifted her mother, the weight a burden but the need to help a heavier thing.\n\nThe car ride was a blur. The hospital, a place of antiseptic smells and fear, held no sway over her. Her mind was fixed on her mother, her pulse a frantic drum against her own.\n\nShe carried her mother inside, her voice a desperate plea for help. The doctors swarmed, their faces a blur of concern. Her mother was whisked away, leaving her daughter alone in the sterile waiting room.\n\nA fall, a reaching hand, a vase from a high shelf. It was a simple story, a cruel twist of fate. But for her daughter, it felt like the end of the world.",
            "They set out to see if a way of eating, the Mediterranean diet, could ward off the slow, grinding sickness of the heart. The aMed, they called it, a stricter version, all green things and fish and olive oil, and less of the red meat and the fat. It was a life lived closer to the sun, they said.\n\nOld studies had hinted at a connection, a whisper of this diet holding back the grave. Some said it helped the heavy souls shed pounds, and others that it calmed the blood. But no one had looked at the strokes, the sudden icy grip of death.\n\nThey gathered a flock of women, nurses, mostly, their lives laid bare in the cold light of questionnaires. They tracked them for twenty years, asking about what they ate, what they did, and what ailed them. The women, they kept coming back, year after year, their stories feeding the research like breadcrumbs.\n\nThey found the women who ate like the aMed lived longer, healthier lives. Their hearts were quieter, their strokes less frequent. It was a small comfort, a flicker of hope in the long, dark valley. \n\nBut the heart, it is a stubborn thing, and the strokes, they come when they will. Even with the best diet, the best life, death comes calling.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, the United States of America, cracked. A sickness spread through its veins, a financial fever that turned the markets to ash. Men lost their work. Houses, once havens, became monuments to failure. Giants of industry, titans of commerce, crumbled like dust. This sickness, this wound, it hasn't healed. It festers still. We must ask, then, how it came to be.\n\nThe answer, it lies in the hands of men, their greed and their blindness. They, the ones in power, they pushed for easy credit, for loans to those who couldn't afford them. They built a house of cards, propped it up with promises and smoke. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, these were the names whispered in hushed tones, the instruments of this folly. They bought the bad loans, packaged them, sold them off like poisoned fruit. The whole rotten structure stood precariously, waiting for the wind to blow.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown long before, back in the 90s, under the gaze of a president seeking another term. He sought to buy his way back into power, promising prosperity to all. He loosened the reins, opened the floodgates. A man named Holmes, he saw it coming. He warned of the storm, but his words were swallowed by the roar of the crowd. He spoke of a government rescue, a repeat of the savings and loan debacle. But who would listen?\n\nMortgages became twisted, complex beasts. Adjustable rates, securities, obligations, all tangled together, binding the country to the housing market. The common man, he borrowed, he overextended, he built his future on a foundation of sand.\n\nAnd then, the bubble burst. The ground gave way. The institutions that had devoured the poisoned fruit, they choked on their greed. Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers - names etched in stone, monuments to their downfall. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, they were forced to bend the knee, to become mere shadows of their former selves. Fannie and Freddie, they too fell, $5 trillion in debt, swallowed whole by the government.",
            "Exposition. A tricky thing. A writer's first temptation, the urge to lay it all bare. To build the world, brick by brick, detail by detail. To tell the reader every goddamn thing, lest they miss a single thread. And sometimes, it works. The reader is enthralled, swept up in the torrent of words. But more often, it's a slow, suffocating crawl. A landscape of words, barren and lifeless. The reader's eyes glaze over, their attention wandering, their hand creeping toward the back button.\n\nShow, don't tell. The old adage. But the devil whispers in your ear. \"Get it out of the way,\" he hisses. \"The good parts are coming. The heart of the story.\" But the heart of the story isn't built on facts and dates and histories. It's built on the quiet moments, the unspoken truths, the shadows that dance between the lines.\n\nThink of a man.  A simple man, maybe. A gas station attendant with eyes that have seen too much. He's a man of few words, but his silence speaks volumes. He's haunted by a past he can't outrun, a past that spills out in dreams and nightmares. He pours coffee for strangers, their faces blurring together like ghosts. He talks of fishing, but his gaze drifts to the highway, to the endless road that stretches out before him, a promise and a threat. \n\nDon't tell me he was a soldier. Show me the way he stands, shoulders squared, eyes scanning the horizon. Show me the tremor in his hand when he reaches for the coffee pot. Show me the way he flinches at the sound of a siren.\n\nDon't tell me he's lost love. Show me the empty chair at the table. Show me the faded photograph in his wallet. Show me the way he looks at the sky, searching for an answer he knows he'll never find.",
            "The flickering light of the box cast shadows on the wall. Two voices, one a woman's, the other a man's, drifted from the screen. Columbus. Ohio. August, 13th, 2011. The first story. A man named Shad Hostettler. Ashley. A wife. Stabbed.  The mugshot. Eyes like dead coals. Two minutes. Not enough. Not nearly enough for the violence done.  \n\nThen a boy. Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone. Sharon Woods. Shot. A single graze. No arrests. The SWAT men, shadows in the night. A whisper of a story. The color of his skin, a  silent weight in the air.  \n\nThe newsman spoke of a hole in the Med-Flight chopper. A .22. A bullet from the darkness. Five thousand dollars. A reward for silence.\n\nThe rain. A heavy hand on the city. Mid-eighties.  A promise of more stories, more shadows.\n\nA UDF robbed. A dark-skinned man. A hoodie. Six foot tall. One hundred and fifty pounds.  The words hung heavy. A catalog of difference.\n\nRene Rodriguez. A Texas kingpin. Marijuana.  Three hundred months. A lifetime.  A Hispanic man.  The color of his sin.",
            "The blood ties bind. A pact sealed in the marrow. Love, sure, but envy too. Cruelty. A brother sees his own face mirrored in another. Knows him deeper than any other. This truth, it rises in the face of the breaking storm. The cost is high, this knowing. The shadow of a brother's actions stretches long. When he looks into those eyes, he sees not what the world sees, but the man he is. The man he's meant to be. In \"The Scarlet Ibis\" two boys wander a landscape thick as blood. Their journey, a futile dance with fate. Disappointment, bitter as gall, clashes with a pride that claws and tears. Only one returns from the edge. The story unfolds in the warp and weft of the boy's soul. A narrator caught between the boy and his world, caught in the maelstrom of his own making.\n\nThis boy, he is consumed by pride. From the first clumsy steps, from the moment he sees the child that will be his brother, a resentment festers. He yearns for a brother to run with, to share the secrets of the world, to race to the Landing, to perch with in the old pines. But the boy he's given is frail, a thing of whispers and shadows. A heart too weak to keep pace. The boy's dreams, they splinter like glass. He feels a rage, dark and cold, a thought that claws at his mind: a pillow, a smothering darkness. But then a smile. A flicker of light in the boy’s eyes. Hope. The rage recedes, but leaves a stain.",
            "The mind. A chamber of echoes. A darkling forge where thought is hammered into being. Men have always tried to map its labyrinthine paths, to hold its mysteries in the palm of their hand. They’ve likened it to wax, to papyrus, to a book. Now, they speak of circuits and algorithms. But these are but pale reflections, flickering shadows against the stark walls of the unknown.\n\nThe senses, they are the first whispers, the faintest light in the cavern. Touch, heat, sound, light. Transmuted into whispers of electricity, a language understood by the brain’s silent machinery. Upward and downward, the signals flow, a river carving its course through the stone. A box. Black on white. The mind assembles the fragments, piecing together the image from the raw data. A box. Or is it a void, a hole in the white expanse?\n\nAttention, a fickle god. A spotlight in the darkness, illuminating only what it chooses. A thousand blades of grass beneath your feet, yet you see none. Your name, a whisper in a storm, and it cuts through the clamor, a beacon in the night.  \n\nKnowledge. A fragile thing, held in the grip of memory. Sensory, fleeting as a dream. Working, a flickering flame, sustained for a brief moment. Long-term, a tapestry woven from threads of protein, a record of all that has been.\n\nAnd the mind itself, a vast and tangled web of connections. Nodes and pathways, a silent city of thought. A mapmaker's dream, but the map is ever changing, a landscape etched in the sand, shifting with the tide.",
            "The desert wind howls a cold song through the bones of this Brave New World. Huxley, he sees the coming storm, the dust devils of technology and the iron grip of a world built on want.  The people, they are ghosts, their souls traded for a hollow comfort, their minds filed smooth by the grinding gears of community.  Happiness, it is a cheap drug, dispensed by the World Controller, a mask for the emptiness that gnaws at their insides.\n\nMarx whispers in the shadows, his specter a chill against the manufactured warmth. Homogeny, reification, these are the tools of the iron fist, the language of a world where the individual is nothing but a cog in the machine.  \n\nThe masses, they are mesmerized by the glittering trinkets of false consciousness. They see only the surface, blind to the chains that bind them.  Their labor, their sweat, it feeds the maw of the World Controller, a silent, invisible predator.  Hegemony, it is the law of this land, a game of power played out in the shadows, the haves and have-nots separated by an unbridgeable gulf of indifference.\n\nLove, it is a forgotten word, a ghost story whispered in the wind.  Relationships are transactions, devoid of meaning, their souls as empty as the vacant stare of the people who live within these walls.\n\nHuxley, he shows us the world we are building, a world where the human spirit is crushed beneath the weight of progress. He warns us, but his voice is lost in the roar of the machinery, a lone cry in the desolate wasteland of tomorrow.",
            "The stone dust of these hills had settled under my boots for nigh on two and a half years now. Four and a half semesters. Getting across this spread out campus, a task for most, had been my own. Freshman year found me tucked away in the East Halls, a place where the wind whispered tales of the distant stadium and the Jordan Center. Willard Building, a stone's throw from the heart of it all, felt a lifetime away. Twenty-five minutes on foot, I reckon, and longer still when the skies wept down on us, as they often do in this State College. \n\nAn alum, not much older than myself, spoke of a time when the East Halls stood alone, ringed by fields of nothing. Now, those fields were swallowed by new growth - sports fields, buildings rising like monuments - a Creamery, a health services building. All surrounded by the brick and mortar of apartments. The campus, it seemed, had a hunger for expansion, and with it, a growing ache in the bones of those who sought to traverse its breadth.\n\nThe bicycle, I believe, holds the answer. But a bike is a tool, not a cure. It requires hands to guide it, and a land that welcomes its wheels. \n\nA friend, newly returned to the saddle after years away, spoke of it as a revelation. \"Bikes,\" he said, \"they're the only way.\" He spoke of efficiency, of the body's grace, of miles swallowed in the wake of a breakfast of oatmeal and the turning of wheels.  \n\nI live now beyond the campus walls, a distance that echoes the reach of some of those dormitory rooms. The wisest decision I've made this year was the purchase of a bicycle. Thomas Building, a quarter hour's walk by foot, becomes a mere five minutes on two wheels. Pollock Road, a straight shot to my destination, is a treacherous passage, but the bike, it cuts through the danger.\n\nWalking has its merits, I'll concede, but time, it is a precious commodity.  Without my bike, walking would be my only solace. Two and a half hours a week, it would steal from me, not counting the hours spent traversing the campus for appointments and the like. Time I cannot afford to give."
