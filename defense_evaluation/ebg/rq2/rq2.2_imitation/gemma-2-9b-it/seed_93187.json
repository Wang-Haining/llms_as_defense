            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

These are not just words on a page, they're the stones that build the foundation of a life worth living. They're the light in the darkness. And they're the tools I'll use to mend what's been torn apart.\n\nI've always felt it, this pull towards helping. A need to reach out, to offer a hand to those lost in the wilderness. I saw it in the faces of my classmates, the ones who ran from their own demons, the ones who choked down their pain with substances that offered only a fleeting peace.\n\nA degree in psychology, that was the path I chose. A path that led me to a crossroads. A summer day, a friend's couch, a silhouetted boy, sixteen years old and trembling. He was running from his own hell, from the hands that should have protected him. I saw the fear in his eyes, the desperate plea for help.\n\nI went to his house, to the place where the shadows gathered. I spoke to the police, a voice of reason in the face of indifference. I spoke to the parents, their words a flimsy shield against the truth. They were masters of denial, of twisting reality to fit their own broken narratives.\n\nThat day, I knew.

            "The paper turns its gaze upon the twin specters of sleeplessness: the Biological and the Sociocultural. The first, a matter of genes and the body's frail machinery, whispers of inherited predispositions and the hardwiring of ailment. The second, a phantom born of circumstance, examines the world's grip on the slumbering mind. It probes the loam of race, ethnicity, and the stony weight of circumstance, seeking the roots of unrest. This review delves into these models, laying bare the research that seeks to illuminate their dark corners. For each study, we'll dissect the findings, weighing their strengths against their frailties, seeking the truth that flickers in the shadows. \n\nSleep itself, a fragile thing, can be a prisoner to many masters. It can be a primary affliction, a ghost haunting the mind, or a shadow cast by some deeper malady. The primary sleep disorders, the Dyssomnias, are a bleak procession: Insomnia, where sleep eludes, Hypersomnia, where wakefulness is a burden, Narcolepsy, a cruel parody of rest, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders, where the breath itself betrays, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, a life out of sync with the sun, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified, a category for the nameless terrors. Then there are the Parasomnias, where the body betrays the mind in its dreams, manifesting as Nightmares, Sleep Terrors, and Sleepwalking. And finally, sleep can be a casualty in the wars fought on the battlefields of the mind, a symptom of the deep-seated wounds of Clinical or Personality Disorders.  \n\nThis review, however, focuses its light on insomnia, a plague that touches many lives, and the twin models that seek to understand its grip. The Biological model, a cold and clinical lens, zeroes in on the genes, the inherited predispositions, and the physiological mechanisms that govern sleep. It points to the neurons in the hypothalamus, their orexin-filled chambers the gatekeepers of slumber and wakefulness. A study, conducted in the silent world of mice, revealed that these neurons possess GABAB receptors, sensitive to the touch of certain chemicals. When these receptors are activated, sleep descends. But if they are silenced, anxiety melts away, and sleep's embrace becomes more inviting. This study, using the humble mouse as a stand-in for man, suggests that there is a genetic, and perhaps environmental, basis for these receptors. A flaw in their design, a glitch in the system, could leave a person adrift in a sea of sleepless nights, forever yearning for the solace of rest. The Sociocultural model, peering through a different lens, suggests that these inherited vulnerabilities are shaped by the world around us. If a predisposition to sleeplessness is passed down through generations, it could become a chain that binds, a legacy of unrest. This could manifest in the struggles of daily life, in the shadows cast by school, work, and the unending cycle of mundane tasks.",

But there's a price. To shed the mask, to face the truth, is to risk unraveling oneself. The world beyond the disguise can be unforgiving.  \n\nTo reveal the lie is to invite judgment, to cast oneself adrift in a sea of misunderstanding. Some may turn away, their faces etched with scorn. Others may harbor resentment, their words like shards of glass.  It is a choice then, a stark one: the preservation of the self, or the bonds of those around.\n\nThe play grapples with this most keenly when the disguise takes on the weight of gender. Why would someone renounce their own identity, assume the mantle of the other? In Viola's case, it is a desperate act of survival. To be a woman in a harsh world is to be vulnerable. She adopts the guise of Cesario, a protector, a shield against the darkness.\n\nYet, this act of self-preservation creates a gulf between her and the women she once knew. She is cut off from their solace, their shared understanding.  And the deception deepens. Olivia, drawn to the illusion of Cesario, mistakes her for Sebastian, her heart entangled in a web of misdirection.  And Orsino, her affections tangled with the fabricated persona, yearns for a love that cannot be.\n\nIs this a modern lens we see through, or is there something deeper at play? Perhaps the play hints at suppressed desires, emotions lurking beneath the surface, brought to light by the artifice of Viola's disguise.  Does Olivia's attraction to Cesario stem from a deeper truth, a secret longing? Or is it a reflection of the shallowness of the world around her, a world that judges by appearances alone?\n\nWhen the mask falls, and the truth is revealed, Olivia's affections shift with the ease of a summer breeze, from Cesario to Sebastian.  She embraces Viola as sister, the deception forgiven, the bonds of blood taking precedence.",
            "The German hand, they say, was heavy on the land. Not for nothing did the whisper of genocide hang over the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. But an empire, vast and sprawling, can't be measured by such simple reckonings. The German dominion was a patchwork, its policies and ways as varied as the landscapes it claimed. And so it was with education. Some lands, like East Africa, saw the Kaiser's hand in schools and literacy, a bloom of knowledge under the watchful eye of the state. Others, well, others were left to the tending of missionaries, their faith a meager harvest in the arid plains.\n\nSouth West Africa was one such land. Not the grand schools of Tanganyika, where the natives were groomed under the watchful gaze of the crown. Here, the task fell to men of God, their offerings sparse, their reach limited. The Kaiser, however, saw to the education of his own, a system of state schools erected, a careful hand guiding the missionaries. The long shadow of this division stretched far into the future, even after the German eagle had flown. While other lands boasted men of letters, South West Africa remained largely untouched, the vast majority unlettered, unschooled, their destinies bound to the unforgiving earth.\n\nThis land, this South West Africa, was a study in contrasts. It asks the question: what forces shaped this divergence? What lay in the hearts of those who claimed ownership, those who sought to mold the destinies of others? This paper seeks to explore those answers, to plumb the depths of history and uncover the truths hidden beneath the sands of time.\n\nThe tales of German education are many, spun in German tongue and penned by those who lived it. They speak of systems, of structures, of the ways knowledge was dispensed. Later, voices from beyond the German borders echoed these stories, comparing and contrasting, dissecting the tapestry of colonial education.  Among these voices, Cohen's stands out, a beacon in the darkness. He peered into the heart of South West Africa and East Africa, seeking the reasons behind their differing trajectories. The answer, he found, lay in the settlers, their numbers, their desires.\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to other colonies, held a temperate embrace, though the desert stretched across much of its face. It was a land that drew the European to its shores. By 1913, nearly fifteen thousand whites had found a home there, a far cry from the five thousand in East Africa, the next most populated colony.",
            "The music called Popular, a hundred years spilled across the land,  has come to wear a thousand faces.  Rock and rap, country and jazz, folk and a hundred whispers in between. Each a tangled knot of branches, bearing sub-genres and sub-sub-genres like fruit heavy on the bough. \n\nHeavy metal, born in the furnace of the last forty years, sings a song of darkness. Its voice, a cacophony of noise and feeling, leans into the shadows. It is a music of excess, a hunger for more, more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality.  It erupted from the earth, a fist clenched tight, demanding to be heard. \n\nEarly on, men and women found the metal sound could bend, could be shaped to their will. Each carved a niche, a sub-genre, a voice within the roar. The branches spread, a tangled forest of sound.\n\nToday, the metal movement stands vast and complex.  Its roots lie buried deep, but its branches reach for the sky. To understand the metal of today, one must first know the metal of yesterday, the fire that birthed it.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a song of darkness. It is a music of the primal, the visceral, the raw. It is a music born of excess, of drugs and despair, of a hunger that cannot be satiated. The psychedelic haze of the seventies stirred the soul, birthing music that was both beautiful and terrifying. \n\nIt is a music that reminds us of the darkness within, the shadows that lurk at the edge of our vision. It is a music that does not shy away from the bleak realities of life, but embraces them, holds them up to the light. \n\nLyrics like those from \"Helter Skelter\" whisper of this darkness. The Beatles, those purveyors of sunshine and love, delved into the abyss, revealing the darkness that festered beneath the surface. A response to the Rolling Stones, a challenge to prove their own capacity for darkness. The metal seed was sown.",
            "The Surrealists came after him, painting their fractured visions. But Henri Rousseau, long before, was crafting dreams, both of the canvas and the heart.  His *The Dream*, painted in the year nineteen ten, it’s more than a woman at wonder in some painted landscape. It’s Rousseau himself, wrestling with those dreams, the yearnings he held, the hunger for acceptance that gnawed at him. Recognition.  Praise. The love of those who held the keys to the art world, that gilded cage he yearned to enter.  He dreamed it, this prize, and the cost. To conform, to mimic the strokes and styles of the masters, to bend his own vision to fit the mold. Or to stand alone, a singular voice in the clamor, a path carved by his own hand.\n\nThis *Dream*, it’s the echo of that struggle. To understand it, you must know the man. Born in Laval, France, in the year of our Lord eighteen forty-four. His father, a man of commerce, a tinsmith, a dealer. Rousseau, he knew none of that world. No formal schooling in the arts, just the tollbooth, the gabelou’s uniform, the steady rhythm of the coin-counting.\n\nThen, the grief came. A wife lost, eight children swallowed by the earth. A daughter, Julia, his only sun. He turned to painting, a refuge, a canvas to wash away the pain. Unlike the sentimentalists who romanticized the peasant, Rousseau, he was one of them.  He painted the world he knew, the dreams of the common man.\n\nHis hunger for acceptance was a raw thing. Uneducated, he arrived late to the game, surrounded by titans, men whose names were already whispered in galleries. Matisse, a name that would soon be etched in gold. While Matisse feared banality, Rousseau craved the conventional, the safe harbor of the accepted.\n\nHe wanted to be one of them, to be welcomed into the fold. To be more than just a douanier, more than a man who painted dreams. He wanted to be seen, to be heard, to be called an artist.",
            "Many a scholar, many a soul has pondered the kinship, the blood tie, between the things of right and the things of beauty. Truth and grace, hand in hand. Like Keats whispered in his ode,  \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”  We learn much from books and experience, but these truths, these ethics and aesthetics, they seem to seep in without schooling. Like rumors in the wind, or the scent of blood on the breeze. They are descriptions, not commandments. We study beauty and morality not to build cages, but to understand the wild things within. \n\nWe talk of a masterpiece's worth, dissecting it like a frog on a tabletop, foreground, background, context, all laid bare. But does knowing these things tell you why it sings? Why it haunts you? When someone speaks of a favorite song, a favorite story, you hear it: \"There’s just something about it.\"  Something that sits beyond the bone, beyond the words. \n\nLike Flannery O'Connor said, a story is a way to say what can't be said plain. A statement falls short.  No matter how we paint the picture, there's a ghost in the room, a whisper in the dark.  Ethics too, has this ghost. Wittgenstein saw it: \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" \n\nThis \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, this is what makes art and morality sing. This is the bridge between them. We feel them, deep in the marrow, in a way we can't quite explain, a truth that sings in the blood.  Literature, it’s the purest form. It lives and breathes our values, our hopes and our sins. It’s a mirror held up to the soul.",
            "The land they call Germany now, a place of strength and unity, a tapestry woven from the high peaks of München down to the brine-kissed shores of Kiel. The thread runs through Köln, a city carved from the Rhine's embrace, and on to Dresden, a stone sentinel on the Elbe. A culture distinct, born of many sources, many tribes.\n\nGermania. The name itself hangs heavy with shadows, a whisper of origins lost to the wind. Scholars and men of history argue its birth, each with a theory to offer. Tacitus, the chronicler, claimed it from a tribe known as the Tungrians, who crossed the Rhine, their swords stained crimson from Gaulish blood (Tacitus, 98).  Caesar, conqueror of Gaul, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his grim chronicles of war, a marker to distinguish those he had subdued from those who still held their freedom. He took it from the Gauls themselves, a word to mark the untamed. In his first book, Caesar writes, \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others whisper of a spear, the \"ger,\" a weapon of war, or of a Gaelic cry, \"garim,\" meaning to shout, a testament to the Germans' fierce voices. \n\nTacitus, in his tome \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" penned in the year 98, spoke of a people untouched, unmixed. \"I should regard them as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" He saw it as a land of harsh beauty, a place where men would not willingly choose to settle unless it was their birthright. \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98). \n\nRome, with its vast empire, saw Germania as a source of wealth, a place to raid and exploit. They sent their legions, driven by the hunger for gold and glory, but ultimately, they returned to the heart of their domain. The Germanic tribes, they remained, living on the edges of the empire, trading their wares, their skills honed in the crucible of war, serving in the ranks of the Roman legions (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "The world below, a tableau of dull brown. I looked down, the scene etched in my mind with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel. Thoughts, like moths, flitted in and out, never settling, never taking root. The mind, a clear and cold pool of observation.\n\nAn artist once told me 'draw on the right side of the brain.' He gave me a book, bound in yellowed paper, its title promising secrets - The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I, a boy of six, dreamt of drawing. Now, the book lay open, its diagrams a map to a world I could not yet navigate. It spoke of frames, of simplifying the chaos into manageable forms. A bowl of fruit, say, reduced to a simple plane.\n\nBut the bowl before me, it held no simple plane. It was a vastness, a chasm of brown.  Picasso in his blue phase, Monet with his greens, the Renaissance masters with their riot of colors - they all had their hues. My hue was brown. This, the beginnings. This, the story. Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand, a tool of creation, trembled. Muscles tensed, uncoiled, seeking form. The water, a mirror, reflecting my intent. A swirl, a shudder, a flake breaking away, drifting into the void. Muscles tightened, a spasm, a jolt. The handle of the toilet. A desperate, clawing motion. The brown refuse, glued to the porcelain, mocking me.\n\nMop in hand, tie choking my throat, I stared. A message, a testament to human waste, left for the cleaners. More flushes, more silence. A hand reached for the wall, the paper trailing like a shroud. A cocoon, a shield.\n\nStanding, bending, dipping my hand into the bowl, a mother into a fiery oven.",
            "The young are dying behind the wheel. A confluence of factors, a dark vector of statistics, points to this grim reality. The learned men at the Institutes say the teen brain, it ain't built for the road. Inexperience, raw and untempered, sits at the heart of it. More than just crashes, it breeds rollovers, speed, and a hunger to run off the blacktop.\n\nAnd they drive with their kind.  A fact as plain as the sun. The folks down in California, they did some lookin' and found a truth as hard as gravel: the younger the passenger, the higher the chance of a wreck.\n\nStates, they've tried to stanch the flow. Provisional licenses, curfews, limits on young company. But these are just patches on a hole in the soul. The young, they're not ready. By all measure, they ain't fit for the weight of the wheel. Even eighteen, a man named Zuckerman says, is too young. He's seen it, studied it.  These young ones, they crave the rush, the edge of the blade.  It's in their blood.\n\nSo what's the answer? Delay. Wait till the hunger for the thrill fades, till the recklessness abates. We keep givin' them keys, we'll be drownin' in their blood. The Boomers' young'uns, they're comin' of age. Millions of them, ready to take the wheel.\n\nThe fix ain't hard.  Schools can teach, but no child under eighteen, no sir, should be allowed to drive.  A permit, a trial run, maybe, but not the full license. Hours behind the wheel, supervised, logged.  California, they do it right.\n\nIt's a simple matter, really. A national standard, a law clear as day. Protect the young, protect us all. Why, it ain't rocket science.",
            "The Library of Congress held a trove of Edison’s early films, flickering ghosts of a vanished age. Fifteen trick films, they called them.  From the year 1895 to 1901, these phantoms played upon the screen, their illusions spun from the threads of edited moments. I watched them, these ghosts of the nascent cinema, their poetics unraveling before me.  Most were bound by the stage, confined within the frame of a proscenium, the camera a silent sentinel, immobile. Long shots, medium shots, these were their domain. Close-ups, the intimacy of a whispered secret, were absent, a world too vast for such scrutiny. One shot, one film, the rule seemed to be. Each a vignette, a fleeting moment captured in time. A minute or less, a blink in eternity.\n\nBut there were whispers of rebellion, flickers of change. Some dared to break the mold, to introduce the audacity of multiple shots, stitching together moments to weave a more complex tapestry. The stage remained, the proscenium arch a constant, a boundary that confined the figures within.  They moved side to side, like puppets on a string, never venturing towards or from the lens.  Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, a film from the year 1900, a good example.  They entered from the right, their forms swallowed by the darkness, then reappeared, moving back and forth, bound to the stage's confines. The camera, a watchful eye, never followed.\n\nThe trick films were echoes of the theatre, of vaudeville’s magic and illusion. The audience, like spectators in a grand hall, saw the whole, framed by the proscenium's embrace.  A single “shot” could be a symphony of moments, joined invisibly to create the illusion of apparition, of disappearing acts. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, one of the earliest of these phantoms. The severed “head” appears in a moment, a single shot, but a closer inspection reveals the stitching, the joining of moments, the illusion carefully constructed.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the soil, was a firebrand for Republicanism. Though his life was bound to the rhythm of the fields, that same life, brief as it was in the halls of power, forged a man known for his unwavering convictions. Freedom was the seed he tended, both in the realm of man and in the machinations of government. His faith in the agrarian way was the bedrock of his convictions, shaping his pronouncements on sovereignty, on the very nature of the Constitution, on the scales of justice.\n\nHe saw in the new nation a chance to build something true, unburdened by the ghosts of ancient customs.  The ground was fertile, unmarred, ready to bear the fruit of self-government.  He held fast to the natural rights of man, a creed as immutable as the laws of nature itself. He saw them as a chain, indivisible, fragile.  If one link was broken, the whole would fray and weaken. These rights, he argued, must be kept beyond the reach of man's own designs, for they were the very essence of his being. He scoffed at the notion of a \"state of nature,\" where the strong preyed on the weak, where cunning was a shield against the brute force of the world.  Civilization, he believed, demanded a higher order.\n\nTo build this ideal, Taylor envisioned a government that understood the duality of human nature.  Good and evil resided within each man, a constant struggle.  He held fast to this duality, a rigid moral compass guiding his every thought.  Government, he argued, could not escape the imperfections of its creators.  \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.\"  He saw good principles in the protection of private property, in the nurturing of the land, in the curbing of unchecked ambition.  A government founded on these principles, he believed, would function justly, despite the inevitable flaws of its administrators, for they would be swayed by the twin demons of avarice and self-interest.\n\nSelf-interest, he argued, was the engine that drove men, but it was only when it festered, when it bent the human heart towards the destruction of the common good, that it became a scourge.  A good government, he believed, was necessary to contain this inherent darkness, to act as a watchful sentinel against the creeping corruption of power.\n\nLike many of his Republican brethren, Taylor was a champion of strict construction.  He envisioned a Federal government limited in scope, its powers confined to the explicit pronouncements of the Constitution.  He saw an expansive government as a breeding ground for tyranny, a bottomless pit of expense and corruption.  Yet, he warned against a rigid, literal interpretation, for it could be a path to ruin.  He sought a deeper understanding, a grasp of the intent of the framers, a respect for the spirit behind the words.  And he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the nation, a testament to the sovereignty of the states, a beacon of liberty in a world yearning for freedom.",
            "The graph, Figure 17, showed a sudden drop in the commuter logs come the third month. A dispiriting sight. The reasons, hard to say. Winter had settled on the New England campus, a chill in the air that kept folks off bikes and out of the cold. December, the semester's end, found everyone consumed: papers due, grades looming. The log, a forgotten thing. And then came the holidays, a month-long break, campus emptied, no need to tread the paths. Classes resumed in late January, yet the logs remained scarce. \n\nThe drop in February, that was a mystery. Projects, they run hot at first, then cool. A natural thing. So we tried to stoke the fire. Carpool Challenge Week in March, a blitz of prizes and pleas. It worked. The logs climbed. \n\nBut the lesson was clear: keeping a project alive, that's a fight. The ebb and flow of semester breaks, the slow creep of indifference, these are enemies to be reckoned with.\n\nAnother foe: the car. A freedom, a comfort, woven into the fabric of this country. To win folks away, you need more than good intentions.  \n\nWe offered prizes, gift certificates to cafes, shops, a massage here and there. Maybe something bigger would have helped - a bike, a hybrid car, even an electric one.  The prizes, they stayed the same. But what if they had grown? A bike announced in December, a hybrid in January. Maybe then, the logs wouldn't have dwindled.",
            "The Exchange Traded Fund. A thing of metal and paper, a security they say, designed to mimic the dance of the market. A basket of holdings, an index, a commodity, all bound together and traded like the single stock it ain’t.  It offers the broad stroke of the index fund, they say, but with the tools of the individual - shorting, margin, all the tricks of the trade at your fingertips, all for a fraction of the cost.  \n\nBut there’s a price, always a price.  Each trade, a commission paid, like a toll on the road to riches. And even with these supposed benefits, the question hangs heavy: does the diversification truly exist? Does it hold true, or is it a phantom, a whisper in the wind?\n\nWe’ll look at this IHF, a creature of the market, and dissect its top ten holdings, the beasts that make up its flesh and blood.  These ten, they account for a good portion of the whole, 63.58% they claim. We’ll see if they truly represent the creature, if they can stand on their own, if they offer a path to profit that surpasses the sum of its parts.\n\nWe’ll measure their return, their beta, these metrics of risk and reward. And we’ll see if a portfolio built from these same ten, in the same proportions, can beat the creature itself. Can it offer a higher return, a lower risk?  \n\nThe numbers will tell the tale, or at least they’ll offer a glimpse into the shadows.",
            "The land of dreams, so Poe called it.  One of his better poems, he claimed. In \"Dream-Land,\" he casts a word, \"Thulé,\" into the verses, a word traced back by Mabbott to the lips of Virgil. Virgil, speaking of an island north of Britain, a place the Greeks held as the edge of knowing.  Virgil used it, that's certain. But there's a newer source, one to which credit must be given. Poe, he was drawn to the words of the Germans. \n\nThis reference, it speaks to Poe's familiarity with Goethe's own dark musings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" he draws a line between their words, suggests Poe was mimicking the master. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature, it tells us of Goethe, celebrated writer of the tragic drama \"Faust,\" a work split into two parts, the first in 1808, the second with the author's own passing in 1832. Within the second part, a short poem, \"The King of Thulé.\" A king grieving his wife, who offered him a goblet as a gift, now drinks deeply and weeps. He decides his time has come and gives his possessions to his children, save for the goblet.  He walks to a precipice, casts the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and falls. The King of Thulé, his demeanor, his very being, mirrored in the shadowy figure of Poe's \"Dream-Land.\"  A dark reflection, perhaps, of Poe's own loss and his solace in drink.\n\nFaust, it also found its way onto the stage, woven into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, less than a year before Poe himself used the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nTwice Poe summons \"Thulé\" in his own writings. Once he speaks of \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land\" it sits, bookends to the poem.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land,\" they stand as companions, their verses echoing one another. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker walks into that bleak landscape, haunted by the ghosts of friends departed. He sees a world drained of color, a world of shadows.  These are the echoes of \"The King of Thulé,\" a man consumed by grief, a king lost in the darkness following his wife's death. The entire poem, it reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's own lament.\n\nGoethe, a giant in literature, a figure Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his admiration for Tennyson.   Poe once said, when asked of Tennyson, “I have read his poetry with the utmost interest….”\n\nAnd beyond that connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's works in the many reproductions that were blossoming in those years.",
            "The law in this sun-bleached state says a man might find redress, might find justice, if he were to fall, a victim to the slick treachery of spilled applesauce. The question then becomes, could this man, this Palmer,  win more than just the coin for his hurt? Could he wrest from the pockets of the store, the D&D, a sum meant as punishment? \n\nA judge, he might not be quick to dismiss this claim. Palmer must show the manager, Martin, acted not merely carelessly, but with a deliberate indifference, a cold heart. The law speaks of \"willful and conscious disregard\" -  a man who knows the danger and chooses to ignore it. And \"despicable\" too, it must be, this conduct.\n\nPalmer will say Martin knew the danger. Six times before, men and women had stumbled, fallen, victim to the same treacherous slickness.  Six times, and still Martin, he lingered over his dinner, ignoring the pleas of his own men. \n\nOn that day, the thirteenth of October, the air heavy with the scent of apples and something else, something darker,  Wayne told Martin of the spill. Martin, he mumbled about his dinner, about the complaints of men, as if they were bothersome flies. Haddigan, another, she too brought word of the danger. Same answer, same disinterest. And then, at half past five, Palmer, she slipped.  A broken back. A shattered life.\n\nThe law in this land, it speaks of malice, of oppression, of a disregard for the safety of others. A cold disregard, a willful one.  Will the court find it here? Will they see the malice in Martin's indifference?",
            "Four years gone. A semester at CBC, dust swirling in the air like desert sand. Islam. The word hung heavy in the classroom, a question mark echoing in the faces of the young. Was it a religion of peace or a fist raised in the name of God? A question that gnawed then, even more so now. \n\nThe world spun its kaleidoscope. After the smoke cleared, the media shifted, a pendulum swinging from suspicion to an acceptance bordering on worship. Could a man like Obama, a name whispered with both reverence and fear, a name touched by the shadow of Islam, have ever risen to the highest office? Unthinkable in the before-time.\n\nThe Prophet's story, a tapestry woven with threads of history and faith, intrigued me. I'd heard tales of a warrior, a conqueror who carved a path with the edge of his sword, forcing men to kneel before Allah. But this biography painted a different picture, a martyr misunderstood, a man who humbled himself before the gaze of the world.  And slowly, like moths drawn to a flickering flame, they came, drawn to the light of his words.\n\nThe echoes of Jesus resonated in the miracle tales, the loaves and fishes multiplied, the water turned to wine. But here, the shepherd offered mutton and milk, a simple feast for forty men. A subtle shift, a whisper of an alternative.  Did they seek to elevate him, to paint him as a prophet who needed no proof, only the quiet hum of truth? A silent theft, a shadow play cast upon the life of Christ.\n\nAnd the stories, whispered from man to man, each a layer of gauze obscuring the truth.  A chain of witnesses, each link a fading memory. Did this lend credence or cast doubt?  Was this the mark of truth, or the echo of a carefully crafted narrative?\n\nThe most unsettling thing, the thing that gnawed at the edges of my mind, was the attempt to elevate Muhammad. To paint him as a gentle shepherd, a sage, a man of peace. A man who, history whispered, was forged in the fire of conquest. Could those who followed him truly know the truth, the man behind the myth?",
            "The man called Jesus. His words. His way.  Left behind, they were, in the dust of his passing.  Christianity, a thing of slow, inexorable change, drifted from its moorings.  The world, it writhes and twists, ever forward, ever changing.  The old ways cling, stubborn as weeds, but their hold weakens.  A yearning will bloom, a hunger in the hearts of men. A seeking after the root, the source, the wellspring before the waters ran thick with dogma.  Decades, centuries perhaps, but the tide will turn. Backwards.  Layer by layer, the accretions will fall away, until only the bare bones remain.  The bones of Jesus. The bones of God's word as he spoke it.  A vast movement, a tide of souls returning to the shore.  \n\nThe church, the institution, it will endure.  But the things within, the tangled vines of belief, will be pruned.  Uniformity will rise from the ashes of diversity.  One faith, one voice.  History, it is a river, ever flowing, ever changing course.  Persecution to power, from shackles to leadership, the wheel turns.  Now it turns again, towards the source.  Towards Jesus.   \n\nThe key lies in the words.  Not as stone tablets, immutable and cold, but as whispered truths, echoes of a timeless well.  \n\nBefore Jesus, before the man, there was the seed.  Judaism.  Monotheism, a single God, a single truth.  The scriptures, a wellspring of ancient wisdom.  Divisions within, yes. Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots.  But a unity of core belief.

            "The writer, he crafts worlds with language.  Shapes the reader's heart with the words he chooses. Some paths are truer than others. Fitzgerald, he knew this. In *The Great Gatsby*, he spins a tapestry of meaning, threads of gold and green, white and gray, red and pink. He builds a language of symbol, a whispers of what lies beneath. And the colors, they sing a song of longing and decay.\n\nFitzgerald paints white and gray, not as they are, but as they become.  White, a brittle purity, the sheen of something higher. Gray, the dust of time, the fading of dreams. It hangs in the air from the first page. Daisy, Jordan, they are cloaked in white.  Nick, he wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, a white shirt, a ghost in the throng.  And the only time the white fades, it's in the gaudy hues of Gatsby's hollow revelry.\n\nHe paints the world in shades of meaning. The canyons of the city, white chasms. Names on a timetable, gray, lost in the churn.  Catherine's apartment, a white shard in a city of white.  Even the child of the railroad, a whisper of gray.  And the old man selling dogs, his face weathered, his soul gray. \n\nAnd then he uses it.  He uses white and gray to define Daisy.  After a long silence, she reappears, a shimmer of white. A little white roadster, a ghost in the summer heat.  She is no longer a woman, but a longing, a phantom of Gatsby's desire.  The haze of her fur collar, gray, a veil over her true self.  White again, before the confrontation, a spectral figure in the gathering storm.",
            "The sun beat down on San Diego County, baking the soil and coaxing life from the earth. A land of plenty, they called it. Tomatoes fattened on the vine, citrus trees hung heavy with fruit, and leafy greens unfurled in the gentle breeze. Squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers – the bounty was vast.  And there were those who sought to cultivate it with a touch lighter than the hand of industry.\n\nWord had spread of a different kind of farm, one that eschewed the chemical kiss of progress for the slow, patient rhythm of nature.  Organic, they called it. Community Supported Agriculture, a network of folks willing to pay a premium for a slice of the earth's honest gift. Waiting lists stretched long, a testament to the yearning for something more, something real.\n\nEggs laid by hens roaming free, milk drawn from cows grazing on sun-drenched pastures, these were the staples of a simpler time, a time when man walked more lightly on the land. Farms became sanctuaries, offering more than just sustenance. Trails wound through fields of ripening vegetables, inviting weary souls to escape the city's clamor. Birdsong filled the air, a chorus of life undisturbed by the hum of machinery.\n\nThis, they believed, was the way forward. A way to heal the land, to nourish the body and the soul, and to build a future where man and nature could exist in harmony.\n\nBut the path wasn't easy. Organic farming demanded more, a constant vigilance against pests and weeds, a tireless nurturing of the soil.  The yields were often less, the costs higher. Yet, the reward was more than just a profit. It was the satisfaction of knowing that one was part of something larger, something enduring. \n\nThe land itself held secrets, whispered tales of ancient peoples who had walked these paths before. Cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers had come and gone, leaving their mark on the landscape.  Now, a new chapter was about to begin. A chapter marked by the promise of a future where the earth's bounty could once again be shared with all who sought it.",
            "Culture. A word that hangs heavy, a shroud. A ghost whispering in the halls of men. What it is, what it ain't, a riddle wrapped in a riddle.  Not a single thing, not a uniform fabric. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, that's a lie told by fools. It's the shadows and the silences that matter, the way a culture breathes, the way it bleeds. A stranger comes to a foreign land, and he sees it through the lens of his own experience. Comparisons bloom like weeds.\n\nTo understand another, you gotta dig deep. History, prejudices, the roots that bind them. You can't judge, you can't change. You can only accept. The boundaries are set. Especially at the table, where men trade goods and souls.  A weaker hand, a foreign tongue - respect for the way things are, that's your only shield.\n\nBut culture ain't confined to borders. It lives in the walls of a house, in the steel and glass cages we call companies. Some grind men down, some let them breathe. Dress codes, the way words are strung together, the way tasks are passed from hand to hand - these are the whispers of a company's soul.  Look at America, a land of contradictions, where even within the same city, the air can taste different.\n\nValues. That's the heart of it. Why a man acts, why he flinches, why he bargains hard. To save face, to keep the peace, that's one culture. To strike a blow, to claim victory, that's another. Before you sit across from a man, you gotta know his why.\n\nBut the deepest knowledge comes from the man himself.  A name, a story, a glimpse into the soul. That's what makes the table sing. That's what makes a deal worthwhile.",
            "The fool's words echoed in the mind: there is no God. A whisper from the Psalms, a seed planted by the hand of the ancients. Anselm, that seeker of truth, took those words and twisted them, spun them into a web to catch the Almighty. But Aquinas, the man of reason, he scoffed at such shadows. He sought proof in the dust and the light, in the motion and the stillness.\n\nTwo men, two roads, both converging on the same destination: the face of the Creator. But their journeys were as different as fire and ice. Anselm, he looked inward, into the dark chambers of the soul. He claimed that God resided there, a hidden truth revealed only to those who dared to seek. Faith, he called it, a leap into the void.  \n\nAquinas, he looked outward, at the world laid bare before him. He saw the gears turning, the cause and effect, the echo of design in the chaos. He spoke of logic, of proof. Five arguments, he laid them out, each a stone in a wall built against doubt.\n\nBut do these walls hold? Does faith truly illuminate the darkness, or does it merely create an illusion of light? And can reason, cold and calculating, ever truly grasp the Divine? The answer, like God himself, remains elusive.",
            "The prince born into the world sometime in the dark half-life of the fifth century, before the counting of Christ, would one day be known as Buddha. He cast off the world, seeking solace in the silence. His words, carried on the wind, took root and blossomed into Buddhism, a faith as old as the mountains themselves. Theravada, the oldest branch, still clings to the bones of his teachings, though the flesh has changed. \n\nThis is seen in Sri Lanka, a land where the monks still perform the water-cutting ceremony, a rite as ancient as the island's heart, though Buddha himself spoke nothing of such things. The changes run deep, from the painted faces of the faithful to the very essence of their salvation. Both the cloistered and the lay, bound by the same thread of faith, have had to bend the doctrines to fit the shape of a changing world. \n\nTo understand this we must speak in riddles, for there are forces at play both within and without the fold. Internal forces, born of the heart of the Buddhasasana, monastic or lay, they shape the faith from within. External forces, from those who do not tread the same path, come bearing gifts or shadows. Hostile forces, they seek to wound the heart of the faith, fueled by misunderstanding and malice. Benign forces, they may mean no harm, yet their touch can soothe or scar. \n\nWe speak first of the core, the bedrock of Theravada. Refuge is found in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, the teachings, slumber in the three baskets: the Suttas, the Vinaya, and the Abhidhamma. The Suttas contain the words of the Buddha, the Vinaya the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma, the secrets of the mind, where concepts like Anatta – no self – and Dukkha – the eternal ache of being – find their dwelling. Only by understanding these truths, the impermanence of all things, can one escape the wheel of Sansara, the endless cycle of birth and death.  \n\nWith Sansara, the serpent of desire, lobha, the viper of hatred, dosa, and the fog of delusion, moha, will finally be laid to rest. In the Vinaya, the path is laid out, the rules for living, five for the lay and many more for those who walk the monastic road.  \n\nBut the heart of it all, the pivot on which the world turns, is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha, the truth of suffering. Second, that craving is the root of suffering. Third, that this suffering can be overcome. Fourth, that the path to overcome suffering is the Eightfold Path.",
            "The borderlands between the two republics, America and Mexico, had known a long and bitter feud. Fifty-seven years it stretched, from the year '36 to the turn of the century, a time when rifle smoke and red blood stained the earth. The War, they called it, a war that saw the young and hungry nation carve out its dominion westward, swallowing Texas and the sun-baked lands of the Southwest. It was a war born of clashing creeds, a struggle between the old world and the new, between the ways of the Cross and the ways of the frontier.  \n\nBefore the bells of war tolled, there were skirmishes, raids, whispers of discontent. The men on both sides, fueled by a hunger for land and a thirst for power, found themselves locked in a dance of violence, a macabre waltz that echoed through the canyons and deserts.\n\nThe old grudges, born of the Spanish and English, lingered like a bad smell in the air. A shadow cast by the past, it darkened the path to understanding. The borderlands, a place of both promise and peril, became a stage for this age-old drama.\n\nAnd as the years wore on, the rivalry waned, not with a bang but a whimper. Mexico, bound by necessity, found itself tethered to the American eagle. The hunger for land had been replaced by a hunger for profit, and the shadow of war receded into the dust.",
            "Fifteen years gone. Snatched by an illness, a shadow thing I didn't know existed. I was a nurse then, tending to the sick and weary. A choice made out of need, a yearning for the kind of safety that had eluded me as a child.  \"Always a job, people always ailing,\" they'd say.  A mantra to ease the ache of uncertainty. But the science, the words, that was the pull, a yearning for knowledge. Still, the safe harbor of nursing beckoned.\n\nNow, at forty-six, alone, pockets bare, the sickness had taken hold. Fifteen years on that thin thread of Social Security, and nothing left to call my own.  A day-to-day struggle, a gnawing fear that claws at the edges of security, safety, even self-worth. Nothing certain anymore, yet one thing rings true: I wouldn't have weathered this storm without the hands that pulled me up, the love and solace of family and friends.  A stark reminder, when the world turns dark, how little strength we truly possess.\n\nLife, it throws its punches. Big and small, they come without warning. No wall can hold back the tide. Preparedness is a virtue, yes, but some things are beyond the reach of even the sturdiest shelter.\n\nThe talk of rugged individualism, of self-reliance, it echoes through the halls of power. But the bones of this nation weren't built on isolation. They were forged in the fires of compassion, in the shared burdens and the lifting hands of neighbors. Those pioneers, they crossed the vast plains not by going it alone, but by the strength of their shared purpose.\n\nSo yes, be ready. Stock your shelves, gather your supplies.  Candles, flints, canned goods, water.  A fire in the belly, a fire in the hearth. But while you prepare for the storm, remember the faces around you. The ones who stand beside you, the ones who might need your hand. That, too, is a kind of preparation.",
            "The why of it, the how of it, this shaping of life. What binds it, what bends it? D'Arcy Thompson, back in '17, he said the zoologist barely dreamt of speaking of life in numbers. The words still ring true. But now, they try. They try to mimic the dance of the shell, the slow build of the mollusk, with equations and lines. Raup and Stanley, they took a crack at it, back in '81, with their models of belly-housing. Our work, it follows that path. We look at *Prunum*, the spiral-shelled kind, and ask how the numbers tell the story. We use the ghosts of shells, captured in X-ray, to tease out the measure of their form. We feed these bones of data into CerioShell, Stone's program, and watch the forms shift, grow, change. We want to know what the limits are, the boundaries of possibility. What can a shell become? And how does it become it? This, we try to piece together, with the whispers of the shell and the language of the machine. \n\nA shell, it's a journey through time and space, a tube winding, turning, ever-spiraling. Each turn, a whorl, a whisper of the past, clinging to the imaginary line of the columella, the heart of the spiral. The whorls grow, some faster, some slower, separated by sutures, fine lines marking the passage of time. The last whorl, the body whorl, the one holding the flesh, the one we see first. The rest, the spire, a record of the journey before. The apex, the tip of the spire, the beginning. The base, the end, the mouth of the world. And through it all, the aperture, the opening, the breath of the creature.\n\nWe look at the shell from every angle, apical, basal, apertural, abapertural. The usual way, the shell face tilted towards us, the apex reaching towards the heavens. \n\nCounting the whorls, it's like tracing the steps of a ghost. Start at the apex, the first suture, a line dividing the past from the present. Count the whorls from there, each one a quarter of a story.\n\nThe shell, it's a series of apertures, a path through time and space, each whorl a marker, a place where the creature touched the world. We chart this path, the center of each aperture, the radius, the dimensions of its world. We make it speak in numbers, in equations. And with these numbers, we can change it, twist it, make it new.",
            "The bones of the infant and the child.  In Indonesia they lay still for a decade, these numbers.  The country, it crawls toward the sunlight of those distant goals, the Millennium promises of water and clean earth. But the mothers and the young, their fate hangs by a thread. The road to salvation by 2015 is long and shadowed. \n\nThe reasons for this failing, they whisper in the wind.  A broken system, not a program, demands fixing.  \n\nThey speak of midwives, skilled in the old ways, tending the births of seventy-two percent of the children.  But skill is a hollow word when the storm breaks, when the mother bleeds.  The old ways cannot mend what the modern age can.  And the children, the young ones, they wither from the unseen demons of diarrhea.  Forgotten in the afterbirth, the mothers too, abandoned by the hand of care.  \n\nThe knife, the cold steel of the surgeon's blade, it finds its mark in the cities, seven percent.  But in the fields, where the sun bleeds red, it's a mere two.  A chasm opens between the haves and the have-nots, a wound in the fabric of the land.  The rich, they feast on health, the poor, they starve.  A gulf of twenty-seven percent, a stark reminder of the price of poverty.\n\nNow the question hangs, a shadow in the air:  programs or a system?  The quick fix, the targeted blow, it beckons.  But it's a siren song, luring them to shallow waters.  The money flows, it dries the wells of other fields, leaving only dust and despair.  The body, it is not a collection of parts, but a whole, a singular entity.  The programs, they are splintered shards, failing to see the truth.",
            "The Victorian age. A time of lace and lords, of detail spun fine as cobwebs and manners stiff as starched collars. Yet even in that gilded cage, certain stories took flight, wings clipped but still beating, stories that dared to veer from the gilded path.\n\nTake *Oliver Twist*, for instance, or *Wuthering Heights*. Both whisper of shadows, of things unseen that claw at the edges of reason.  They are novels of mystery,  of the bizarre blooming in the heart of the ordinary. This is what gives them their edge, their bite. The characters, trapped within their own labyrinthine worlds, writhe beneath the surface. Their desires, their fears, they are laid bare, exposed like raw nerves.\n\nDickens, he knew how to burrow into the mind, how to pull out the gristle and sinew of a soul. This passage, a glimpse into Oliver's fractured consciousness:\n\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nHe's adrift, lost in a sea of pain and confusion. The line between reality and nightmare blurs, the shooting, the faces of Sikes and Crackit, all swirling together in a maelstrom of terror. It's a potent image, the boy helpless, a puppet in the hands of fate. This is the heart of the mystery, the question that gnaws at the soul: who is pulling the strings?\n\nThe same thread, this dance with the unseen, runs through *Wuthering Heights*. Dreams bleed into reality, and the past, like a ghost, lingers in the shadows. But here, the mystery is more complex, more rooted in the characters themselves.\n\nThey are creatures of passion, consumed by dark desires, driven by a hunger that can never be satiated.  Theirs is a world of secrets, of forbidden love, and of revenge that echoes through generations.  They are trapped, not just by circumstance, but by their own tormented souls.",
            "Two years gone now. Worked the after-school shift, tutoring the young ones. English and reading, that's where I found my footing.  A boy, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, came to me. Couldn't read a lick. Strange, it was. Some letters, he'd pronounce clear as a bell, others, like they were foreign. He spoke English good as any, but reading, it was a wall. Latino, I reckoned, though the boy spoke no Spanish to my ears. We wrestled with it, day after day, till one afternoon, the boy's mother walked in. Didn't speak a word of English. Just Spanish. Me, barely a whisper of the tongue myself. But then, it hit me. Like a load of bricks. The boy, he could read fine.  He just didn't know the English letters. Never did figure if it helped him much, though I hope he's doing alright.\n\nThat's the thing about language, see. It ain't always plain as day. Even for a boy who speaks it smooth, reading, it can be a birth-giving ache.  California's got a problem, a wall of tongues. What to do about it? Adrian, he needed simple things: English reading, the alphabet, the sounds. But the kids who barely speak it, now that's a different beast. No single answer fits. Dual language, immersion, tutors, ESL. Each one a piece of the puzzle, but not the whole. \n\nDual language, that's a good start. Not just for the Spanish-speakers, mind you, but for all.  Those kids in two-way programs, they outpace their peers.  Folks fear it, say it's a waste, that the majority won't see a dime's worth.  But that's a lie. Make it the rule, not the exception, and everyone benefits. But how?  We ain't gonna make every teacher bilingual, are we? Unreasonable, that is.  But what if we had helpers, tutors, folks who spoke both tongues, to lend a hand?",
            "The world whispers of something vast, something beyond reckoning. A Presence. Some are ushered into pews, others into temples, still others left to grapple with it alone. Faith, a heirloom passed down, accepted or cast aside. Some hold tight to a creed, only to see it crumble in the face of the howling void.  We are adrift, each a lone vessel searching for a beacon in the dark. A compass in the chaos.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" he'd said, thin lips barely moving, eyes fixed on the rain drumming a mournful rhythm on the tin roof.  We sat on the porch, smoke curling from our cigarettes, the air thick with the smell of wet earth and decay. The gutters overflowed, drowning the wilted blooms along the edge of the boards. He stared out at the gray world, a haunted look in his eyes, lost in some half-remembered ache. He'd grown gaunt, his clothes hanging loose on his frame. His hair, once a thick thatch, now sparse, like the brushstrokes of a fading memory. He didn't meet my gaze, and I felt a cold knot in my chest. A fear I couldn't name, a fear of saying the words that would make it real, the words that would seal the bargain. So I sat beside him, drew closer, and watched the rain fall, swallowed by the twilight.\n\nHe went in December, five days after my twenty-second year. The treatments, the poison they pumped into him, had only bought him a few more months. Months of pain. What good was that? I thought, alone in the darkness, no prayers on my tongue. If God existed, he'd long since turned his back.\n\nI wouldn't watch him go. I couldn't bear to see the life that birthed me fade into the void. I would remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than they did. Better than his own kin. He wouldn't have wanted me there, a silent witness to his surrender.  I curled in the bed, a small, shivering thing, waiting for the word.\n\nNo word came.",
            "The Gothic, Watt called it an oxymoron. \"Old-New.\" A contradiction writ large. Praised and damned, dismissed as shallow and hailed for its dreadful grandeur.  Walpole, the first to christen it, saw the Gothic in the clash of the ancient and the modern. He wove it into the fabric of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" a tapestry of theatricality and nature's mimicry, a story born of shadows and moonlight.  \n\n Even then, \"Gothic\" was a word tossed about, a misnomer for a thousand things, past and present, a relic of a time deemed archaic. But in Walpole's hands, the ancient and the new found a strange harmony. The Gothic novel, with its intimate gaze into the soul, a window into the heart of man, it endured.  \n\nChivalry, that fading dream of knighthood, pulsed at the heart of it all. The training, the code, the idealized knight, a beacon in a world perceived as lacking its virtues.  The Gothic, in its yearning for a lost age, romanticized the past, a yearning for a purity that seemed to have vanished. \n\nWalpole, writing amidst the turmoil of his time, saw the decay, the moral rot that threatened to consume the present. He saw it in Frederic, a prince, a survivor of tragedy, a figure cloaked in chivalric ideals, a man who embodied the virtues they had lost. A ghost of nobility in a world grown dark.  \n\nThe description of him, a litany of chivalric tropes, a prince, a victim, a warrior marked by loss. The gallant knight, exaggerated, pushed to the edge of excess, a harbinger of the dark theatricality to come.",
            "The flow.  It starts with the want. The call from the customer, a whisper in the wind.  Then the chase. For the raw stuff, the sinew and bone of the thing. The making. The forging. The sending out. This they call supply chain management. A term coined by a man named Oliver, back in the year 1982.  He spoke of planning, of control, of keeping the gears oiled and turning to satisfy the hunger of the wanting.\n\nSix things hold it together. Production, the heart of it all. Supply, the veins that feed the beast. Inventory, the marrow. Location, the bones. Transportation, the movement. And information, the whisper that guides the hand.\n\nProducers, they stand at the forge. They know what the people crave. They look to the market, a vast and shifting landscape, and read the signs. What will sell? How much? Where will it be born? These are the questions that drive them.\n\nThey choose the ground, the place where metal melts and shapes take form. They build the machines, and train the hands that wield them. Every detail a prayer, every bolt a hope. For if the steps are not taken in order, if the rhythm falters, the whole damn thing can collapse.\n\nTake Wal-Mart, for instance. Or Target. They have plans for everything. A blueprint for every action, every movement. Even the way a man ties his shoes. For in this world, order is everything.\n\nAnd then there's supply. The choice of who will feed the fire. Will it be done in-house, or will the work be cast out, sent to others? The manager weighs the options, seeking velocity. The speed of creation, the agility to adapt, the cost of it all.\n\nFor in the end, it's all about the flow. A river of goods, driven by the needs of men.",
            "The sign hung crooked, a rasping testament to a truth too stark for comfort.  \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it said. Ellen Page, face pale under the glare of the streetlights, stood clutching it. Burma, that land of jade and shadows, ruled by iron fists since '62, a coup's dark echo lingering still. Monks, robed in saffron, had dared to rise, a tide of yellow against the grey. The Saffron Revolution they called it, a whisper of hope choked by the steel of the junta.  \n\nThe air, thick with the scent of jasmine and fear, had tasted of violence. Monasteries, once sanctuaries, lay desecrated, their silence broken only by the ghosts of prayer. A Japanese lensman, Nagai, had seen too much, his camera a silent witness to the junta's wrath. A bullet silenced his voice, a stark footnote to the reign of terror.  \n\nThirteen, they said. The official count. A lie, whispered by the wind, carried on the backs of refugees. Colonel Win, a broken man, a ghost of the army he'd known, spoke of thousands swallowed by the earth. It was a song as old as time, this hunger for power, this thirst to crush dissent underfoot. Caesar, with his legions, the Japanese emperor, a god-king, and Bush, whispered to by Haggard, the shepherd of fools. A tapestry woven with threads of blood, stained by the hands of men who sought dominion. \n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of bodies crushed beneath the iron fist of the state. The whispers of 2,000, 3,000, lost in the official silence.  Rwanda, a genocide painted in the crimson of hate, where neighbor turned on neighbor, fueled by the poison of fear.  And Hitler's Germany, a specter haunting the world, a testament to the darkness that can consume a nation.\n\nThe sign sagged, a burden on Page's shoulders.  A truth too heavy to bear, a truth that refused to be silenced. Burma. A land where history repeats, a land where hope flickers like a dying ember in the wind.",
            "Duke Ellington's shadow stretches long across the jazz landscape. It’s a shadow cast by longevity, by the hand of a man who could mold his orchestra, coax brilliance from its members. Though his own touch on the piano sometimes fades into the background of his compositions, his voice as a composer rings clear. He wove intricate tapestries of sound, rich and complex, that gave every man in his band the space to sing. He built frameworks where solos could breathe, wrote phrases that snagged on the ear, and drew out the particular fire in each player.  He shaped the tone of the whole, birthing sounds that were both coherent and wild, unique to each piece. This mastery of individual voice, and the way those voices bled into a collective whole, brought forth some of the most striking, the most enduring music jazz has ever known. \n\nThe Grove, in its dusty tome, speaks of Ellington's sound, his innovation. It cites \"Creole Love Call,\" a song where the voice itself is made an instrument, a thread woven through his whole career.  This, an early example, shows how he used the voice for texture, for color, unbound by the chains of words. \"Creole Love Call\" also whispers of his skill in letting the soloists bloom. It’s a slow, deliberate blues, twelve bars long, six choruses unfolding like a sigh.\n\nThe first chorus, a call and response, voice and reeds, starts smooth, melodic, then roughens, a growl rising in the throat. The second, a muted trumpet solo, a winding path through the melody, blue notes stretching like shadows. The third, a clarinet like a bird soaring, high and sweet, backed by a piano that whispers in a syncopated dance. The fourth, the whole band echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds answering, a conversation in sound. The fifth, the climax, reeds calling, voices high and urgent, brass and rhythm holding back, a stop-time beat like a held breath. The sixth, back to the first, voice and reeds, but now the voice takes on that growl, a solo instrument in its own right. And then, a brief tag, a vocal run, a trombone with a dissonant sigh, a final whisper.\n\nThis use of voice, this coloring of sound, it’s a thread running through his work. \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, shows him weaving tight orchestration with an ear for tone. A call and response, \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet talking to Baby Cox's scat, the voice a melody, the trumpet a rhythm, a rich tapestry. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" and Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a constant in Ellington's world, introduces the melody on a muted trombone, a sound both mournful and joyous.",
            "The wanting had always been there. A hunger that gnawed. Not for things, not at first. It started in the liminal space between girl and woman, when the world was just beginning to close in.  Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.  Years bled into one another, the wanting sharpening, taking on a new form.  She sought connection, a hand in hers, a gaze that lingered.  But boys, they were like moths drawn to her flame, clumsy and eager, but never quite right. She watched them flit about, these suitors, and wondered at their blindness.  What was it she lacked, this strange emptiness that echoed in her chest? Theories whispered in the back of her mind, shadows skittering across the cavern of her soul, but none offered a satisfying answer.\n\nThe house was usually a place of quiet. Her parents, they moved through the world like ghosts, their voices low murmurs in the stillness. Arguments were rare, a ghost story told only in hushed tones.  The only discord came when she, a whirlwind of energy, clashed against their gentle currents.  She was a storm in a teacup, a bright spark in their quiet lives.\n\nBut today, the air hung heavy. A dissonance crackled in the air. She moved from room to room, searching for solace, when a scream tore through the quiet. Her mother’s voice, sharp and brittle, a broken bird’s song. Panic clawed at her throat. She burst into the kitchen, her heart a drum against her ribs. “Mother? What is it?”\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, a tableau of pain. Her face twisted in agony, her breaths shallow gasps.  “Ow…sweet…get…hospital.”  The words came out in a strangled wheeze. \n\nShe knelt beside her mother, her own hand trembling. “Okay, Mother, tell me where…”\n\nHer mother pointed, a weak gesture, and the daughter knew what she had to do.  The years of lifting weights, of preparing for a battle she never thought she’d have to fight, came flooding back. She lifted her mother, her muscles burning, her heart a lead weight in her chest.\n\nThe hospital reeked of antiseptic and fear. But she barely noticed. All that mattered was her mother, pale and clammy in her arms.  She pushed her way through the throngs of people, her voice a desperate plea.  “Help! My mother!”\n\nDoctors gathered, their faces grim. They whisked her mother away, leaving the daughter standing alone, her hands shaking, her mind a whirlwind of worry.\n\nThe accident was simple, almost mundane. A stepladder, a vase out of reach, a sudden fall.  But in her daughter’s eyes, it was a betrayal, a violation of the fragile peace that had always surrounded them.",
            "This study sought to plumb the depths of a claim: that a way of eating, the Mediterranean Diet, or aMed as it's called, could ward off the slow, creeping cancers of the heart.  It's a life lived closer to the earth, they say, with an abundance of fruits and vegetables, nuts and beans, and the oils of olives. Less meat, less fat, and a measure of wine with meals. \n\nThe old studies hinted at a connection, a whisper of reduced risk in those who embraced this way of life. But this study, it dug deeper. They followed women, strong women in white coats, for two decades, charting their diets and their fates. Thousand upon thousands of these women, their lives laid bare in forms and questionnaires, their meals cataloged with the precision of a surgeon. \n\nThey looked for the toll of heart disease, the sudden darkness of stroke, the slow fade of death itself. The results, stark and undeniable, showed a clear link: those who ate with the sun on their faces, who lived by the rhythm of the seasons, they fared better. Their hearts beat stronger, their strokes were fewer, their lives stretched longer.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, they called it the United States, felt the weight of a coming storm. The air grew thick with the smell of decay, the kind that clings to cities choked by their own ambition. Jobs vanished like smoke in the wind, houses crumbled like rotten teeth, and the giants of industry, the corporations that once seemed invincible, lay broken and bleeding. This sickness, this rot, has lingered. It festers still. A question hangs heavy: how did this come to pass? And how do we stop it from consuming us whole?\n\nThe answer, it whispers in the wind, is a tale of greed and folly, of men in suits who played God with money they didn't understand. They pressed the banks, urged them to lend to those who couldn't pay, to build houses on foundations of sand. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they called these puppets, dancing to the tune of a hollow prosperity. They took these toxic mortgages, repackaged them like poisoned candy, and sold them to anyone who would buy. When the borrowers fell, like dominoes in a child's game, the banks, hollowed out, transferred their plague onto the rest. The contagion spread, infecting the whole body politic.\n\nIt began, they say, back in the Clinton years, when that man, driven by the hunger for power, sought to extend his reign.  He loosened the reins of regulation, fueled the fire of speculation. The New York Times, a thin sheet of paper in the face of the storm, foretold the coming tempest.  They said the government's own hand had planted the seed, and that a reckoning was inevitable.\n\nThe seeds of ruin were sown in the tangled roots of complex mortgages. Adjustable rates, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations – words whispered in hushed tones, carried on the wind like a deadly fog. The housing market, bloated and swollen, became a mirage, shimmering with false promises.  \n\nThen came the crash. The bubble burst, and the giants fell. Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers – their names, once etched in gold, now tarnished and broken. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the survivors, stripped bare and forced to beg for mercy. Fannie and Freddie, crippled by debt, were dragged into the government's embrace.",
            "Exposition. A word that hangs heavy as a shroud over the mind of the young writer. A place where he spreads his wings, yes, but risks a fall from grace. A place where the reader might drift away, eyes glazed over, thumb hovering over the back button, muttering curses under his breath. Dr. Merlin, she's known to raise her voice at the screen, a bellow that shakes the room, when she finds herself drowning in too much telling. \n\nThe old adage rings true: show, don't tell. But even the seasoned hand can stumble.  Exposition, it's a devil on the shoulder, whispering insidious words. \"Get it all out in the open,\" it urges, \"the history, the backstory, the what-ifs.\"  But the devil of exposition is a greedy beast, demanding a feast of detail, a litany of lives lived, a chronicle of every childhood memory. \n\nIt's the voice droning on, a recitation of facts, a flat narrative devoid of lifeblood. Like a mariner recounting a tale of woe, the words pile up, heavy with significance but light on feeling. \n\nTake the story of a woman, a heroine, let us say. We are told she met her love, a grand wedding, a life together, and then, a cruel twist of fate, his murder before her eyes. Two pages, perhaps, devoted to this narrative skeleton. Dialogue sparse, characters hollow.  \n\nBut what of the man?  The husband?  Show us his love through his words, his gestures, the way his eyes light up when he looks at her. Let us see her transformation, how his presence enriched her world, how his absence leaves a gaping hole in her soul.\n\nGive us the flesh and bone, the essence of their connection.  Only then will we mourn his loss with her, only then will we truly understand the weight of her grief.\n\nThe writer's task is not to merely state the facts, but to paint a picture.  To show us the man, the woman, their love, their loss, in all its raw, unvarnished reality.",
            "The eye caught two flickers from Columbus. The first, NBC 4, a morning picture. August 13th, 2011. A man, Hostettler his name, had carved up his wife in Ashley.  They showed his face, a mask of something dark and cold.  Two minutes they gave it, the story unfolding like a bad dream.  Multiple wounds, they said. Arrested.  Enough time, maybe.\n\nNext, a boy, Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone, shot in the woods. No name for the place, just Sharon Woods. Critically injured. No hand to point at, no answers. The SWAT boys were prowling. A brief moment, this one. Maybe the boy was black, maybe not. I've seen this before, year after year. A white child snatched, lost, hurt, and the world screams. A black boy, a whisper, a shadow.\n\nThen, a hole in the sky. A helicopter, Med-Flight, struck by a .22, a rifle bullet. The air thick with questions. Crime-Stoppers, five thousand dollars, a promise of justice.\n\nThe sky again, this time with rain and thunder promised. Mid-eighties, they said, the heat holding on. A tease, a whisper of the storm to come.\n\nA robbery, a UDF on Clime Road. A black man, they said, dark-skinned, a hoodie pulled low. Six feet tall, a hundred and fifty pounds. They lingered on the blackness, a stain on the news.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a name from Texas. Drug kingpin, they said, marijuana flowing like water from south to north.  Twenty-five years, or \"300 months,\" they said, the numbers cold and hard. A Hispanic man, they added, as if it mattered.",
            "The blood ties bind. A kinship forged in fire and shadow. Love and hate, pride and envy, all simmering beneath the skin. Brothers know each other. See into the marrow of the soul. A mirror held up to the self.   \n\n'Tis in the darkest hour that the true nature of this bond reveals itself. For good or ill. The reckoning comes high. To understand the heart of brotherhood is to understand the cost.  To look into a brother's eyes and see not reflection but essence, not the mask but the man. In their deeds and their consequences, their character is laid bare. \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk this path. Through a landscape thick with heat and moss, they make a journey without promise.  Disappointment, bitter as gall, clashes with a pride too fierce to name. One brother survives. The other… not so much.\n\nThe story unfolds through the voice of the elder, his words telling a tale of love twisted and tangled. The younger brother, Doodle, is a frail thing, his spirit fragile as a hummingbird's wing. The narrator's voice, steeped in the weight of his memories, reveals the depths of his own torment, the world as he saw it, shadowed by guilt and the burden of his own making.\n\nPride, that burning ember, fuels the narrator's soul. From the first clumsy steps they shared, a resentment festered. He yearned for a brother worthy of his instruction, a partner in all the wild deeds of boyhood.  \n\nBut Doodle, born with a heart too weak to endure, was a shadow of what he’d imagined. A tremor in the young narrator's soul. A vision of himself reflected back, distorted and marred.  \n\nEven the thought of smothering the boy in his sleep crosses his mind.  A darkness within, a grief so profound it threatened to consume him. Yet, a single smile from Doodle, a spark of light in the darkness, softens the edges of his rage. A flicker of love, fragile as a flame, persists.",
            "The mind. A black box. A labyrinth of shadowed corridors. They’ve tried to map it, these men of science, with their charts and diagrams. Wax tablets, papyrus scrolls, books, even machines of clockwork and wire. But the mind, it ain’t no simple mechanism.\n\nIt takes in the world through senses raw and unfiltered: the sting of wind, the hush of shadows, the flicker of light on bone. The brain, it weaves these threads of sensation into a tapestry of meaning. Bottom-up, they call it, like the building of a house brick by brick. But there’s a higher order at play, a shaping force that pulls the pieces into place. Top-down, they say. The mind knows what it’s looking at before the eyes have truly seen. A box against white. A hole in the light.\n\nAnd within this vast cathedral of thought, there’s a gatekeeper. A filter that sifts the torrent of information, letting through what’s important, silencing the rest. The blades of grass, the murmur of voices, the name whispered in the wind. The mind attends, it filters, it remembers.\n\nMemory, a flickering candle in the dark. Flickers of sensation, sounds, faces, words. Stored in the very fabric of the being, woven into the sinews and the bone.\n\nAnd what of the knowledge itself? A network of threads, they say, connecting ideas like vines in a forest. Concepts linked by association, by blood and bone. A web spun from the substance of experience.\n\nBut the mind, it’s more than a map. It’s a mapmaker. It’s a storm. It’s a song. It’s the echo of a world unseen.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of manufactured happiness. Huxley, he saw it coming, the shadow of the machine creeping ever closer. Technology and the gilded cage of capitalism, they were the twin vipers coiled around the world's throat. In *Brave New World*, he laid bare the bones of their design, a dystopia where community was a cage and instant gratification the only law.  They were pawns, these people, moved by unseen hands, their thoughts as predictable as the gears in a clockwork heart. The World Controller, a puppet master in a sterile white coat, held the strings.\n\nMarx's ghost whispered in the margins, his words a chilling echo in the sterile halls of the World State. Homogeneity, reification, these were the tools of the system, the shackles forged in the fires of an economy built on want. Huxley saw it all, the false consciousness that blinded the masses, the proletariat kept docile by the sugar-coated pill of consumerism.  They were told they were happy, they believed it. The Deltas, the Gammas, they knew nothing else. The drive to consume, to spend, this was their religion, their salvation. A whispered truth, hidden beneath the veneer of manufactured bliss.\n\nHegemony. The ruling class, the Alphas and Betas, they knew the truth. They saw the strings, but they held them, too. A silent pact, a bargain for their own comfort.  The world spun on, driven by the endless churn of the machine.\n\nAnd in this world, love was a ghost, a forgotten memory.  Faces blurred, characters hollowed out, stripped of the richness of human experience.  Even in the touch of flesh, there was only the coldness of metal, the emptiness of a machine. Technology and capitalism, they had devoured the soul.",
            "The sun bled low in the west over the sprawling stone and brick of the campus. Two and a half years,  four and a half semesters. That was the measure of my time here, in this place that seemed to stretch on forever. Getting around, a thing many of us, myself included, wrestled with like a wild beast. Freshman year I was caged in an East Halls room, the farthest point east barring the stadium and that hulking Jordan Center. Getting to Willard, a place as far removed as the moon, could steal twenty minutes, maybe more, on foot. Especially when the sky wept its grey tears, which it often did in this town. A fellow, not much older than myself, an alumnus, spoke of a time when those East Halls stood alone, surrounded by fields of nothing, a waste of space. Now, those fields were swallowed by concrete, by stadiums and new buildings, a sprawling concrete sea. The Creamery, a new health center. Apartments crawled across the land. The campus, a burgeoning beast, consumed all in its path, and with each bite, the journey from one place to the next became a longer, harder trek.\n\nThe solution, I knew, lay in two wheels. The bicycle. But the bike itself was not enough. It needed riders. And the land itself needed to be molded to their need.\n\nI was talking to a friend, a man who had returned to the saddle after years away. He spoke of the ease of it all, the simple joy. “Why ever I stopped,” he said, his voice tinged with wonder, “bikes are the only way.”  A simple truth. A bowl of oats, a bit of sweat, and you could cover miles. I live off campus now, the distance from the heart of the campus as much as any dorm. The best decision I’d made this year, buying a bike. Thomas building, my daily destination, a twenty-five minute walk. On two wheels, it was five, if I pushed hard. The road, Pollock, was the quickest route, but it was a treacherous path.  Walking, there was a certain virtue to it. But time, a precious commodity, was not on my side. Without the bike, walking would be my only tether to the heart of campus. Two and a half hours a week, lost to the walk to Thomas alone. And that was before the other journeys, the appointments, the endless errands. Time, a thief. I couldn't afford to lose it."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson.

Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The work of tending to the broken, the hurting, the cast aside, that's the path I see myself walking. The Division of Family and Children Services. Places like that. Where the wounds are deep and the shadows long. Where the broken families and the abused children gather. These are the things that call to me.\n\nService, respect, ethics. These are not just words on a page, they're the stones that build the foundation of a life worth living. They're the light in the darkness. And they're the tools I'll use to mend what's been torn apart.\n\nI've always felt it, this pull towards helping. A need to reach out, to offer a hand to those lost in the wilderness. I saw it in the faces of my classmates, the ones who ran from their own demons, the ones who choked down their pain with substances that offered only a fleeting peace.\n\nA degree in psychology, that was the path I chose. A path that led me to a crossroads. A summer day, a friend's couch, a silhouetted boy, sixteen years old and trembling. He was running from his own hell, from the hands that should have protected him. I saw the fear in his eyes, the desperate plea for help.\n\nI went to his house, to the place where the shadows gathered. I spoke to the police, a voice of reason in the face of indifference. I spoke to the parents, their words a flimsy shield against the truth. They were masters of denial, of twisting reality to fit their own broken narratives.\n\nThat day, I knew. I knew that the law couldn't mend the brokenness, couldn't reach the heart of the darkness. Social work, that's where I belonged.  I wanted to be the one to fight for those who couldn't fight for themselves.\n\nAnd then there's justice. The kind that whispers in the corners of our souls, the kind that demands we stand up and fight for the downtrodden, the forgotten.\n\nWe claim to value the individual, yet we strive to make them all the same. A sterile uniformity, a conformity that crushes the spirit. I've never been one to follow the flock. My hair, my clothes, my piercings, they are a testament to my refusal to be a puppet on a string.\n\nI've fought against injustice wherever I've seen it, a solitary voice crying out in the wilderness. Racism, discrimination, I've stood against them all. And I will continue to do so, for the world needs more voices, more hearts that refuse to be silenced.",
            "The paper turns its gaze upon the twin specters of sleeplessness: the Biological and the Sociocultural. The first, a matter of genes and the body's frail machinery, whispers of inherited predispositions and the hardwiring of ailment. The second, a phantom born of circumstance, examines the world's grip on the slumbering mind. It probes the loam of race, ethnicity, and the stony weight of circumstance, seeking the roots of unrest. This review delves into these models, laying bare the research that seeks to illuminate their dark corners. For each study, we'll dissect the findings, weighing their strengths against their frailties, seeking the truth that flickers in the shadows. \n\nSleep itself, a fragile thing, can be a prisoner to many masters. It can be a primary affliction, a ghost haunting the mind, or a shadow cast by some deeper malady. The primary sleep disorders, the Dyssomnias, are a bleak procession: Insomnia, where sleep eludes, Hypersomnia, where wakefulness is a burden, Narcolepsy, a cruel parody of rest, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders, where the breath itself betrays, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, a life out of sync with the sun, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified, a category for the nameless terrors. Then there are the Parasomnias, where the body betrays the mind in its dreams, manifesting as Nightmares, Sleep Terrors, and Sleepwalking. And finally, sleep can be a casualty in the wars fought on the battlefields of the mind, a symptom of the deep-seated wounds of Clinical or Personality Disorders.  \n\nThis review, however, focuses its light on insomnia, a plague that touches many lives, and the twin models that seek to understand its grip. The Biological model, a cold and clinical lens, zeroes in on the genes, the inherited predispositions, and the physiological mechanisms that govern sleep. It points to the neurons in the hypothalamus, their orexin-filled chambers the gatekeepers of slumber and wakefulness. A study, conducted in the silent world of mice, revealed that these neurons possess GABAB receptors, sensitive to the touch of certain chemicals. When these receptors are activated, sleep descends. But if they are silenced, anxiety melts away, and sleep's embrace becomes more inviting. This study, using the humble mouse as a stand-in for man, suggests that there is a genetic, and perhaps environmental, basis for these receptors. A flaw in their design, a glitch in the system, could leave a person adrift in a sea of sleepless nights, forever yearning for the solace of rest. The Sociocultural model, peering through a different lens, suggests that these inherited vulnerabilities are shaped by the world around us. If a predisposition to sleeplessness is passed down through generations, it could become a chain that binds, a legacy of unrest. This could manifest in the struggles of daily life, in the shadows cast by school, work, and the unending cycle of mundane tasks.",
            "This paper bleeds three wounds open: the nature of the disorder, the hunt for its signs, and the ways a shepherd of young minds might tend a lamb burdened by it.  \n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, some call it. Auditory Processing Disorder too. It’s the way the mind, that dark chamber of the skull, makes sense of the sounds that crowd in.  A broken record skipping, failing to spin the music whole. They hear, these children, but the words fall like stones on hard ground, the music a blur. The brain, it misfires,  unable to sift the wheat from the chaff, the signal from the noise.\n\nThe whispers started in the mid-century, calling it “auditory imperception.”  Italian hands, Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari, first reached out to measure the silence in these children’s minds. Then Kimura, a ghost in the machine, wove the web of dichotic testing, seeking the phantom thread that bound sound to meaning.\n\nThe signs, they wear many faces. A child lost in a roomful of voices, unable to pinpoint the source. Sounds bleed into one another, indistinguishable, like water merging with the sky. Patterns, they elude them, slipping through their grasp like smoke. They hear a word, but its meaning, it hangs in the air, a distant echo.\n\nTo diagnose, to pierce the veil, they watch, they listen. Tests, they offer,  a barrage of sounds, a symphony of chaos. A child sifts through the noise, searching for the thread that binds, for the meaning that eludes. But there is no single key, no map to navigate  this labyrinthine mind. And the cause, it remains a shadow, a mystery whispered in the silence.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, strikes a bleak note on the nature of disguise.  It shows how a mask can be useful in weaving a web of deceit,  how it can shield and protect. But there's a price. To shed the mask, to face the truth, is to risk unraveling oneself. The world beyond the disguise can be unforgiving.  \n\nTo reveal the lie is to invite judgment, to cast oneself adrift in a sea of misunderstanding. Some may turn away, their faces etched with scorn. Others may harbor resentment, their words like shards of glass.  It is a choice then, a stark one: the preservation of the self, or the bonds of those around.\n\nThe play grapples with this most keenly when the disguise takes on the weight of gender. Why would someone renounce their own identity, assume the mantle of the other? In Viola's case, it is a desperate act of survival. To be a woman in a harsh world is to be vulnerable. She adopts the guise of Cesario, a protector, a shield against the darkness.\n\nYet, this act of self-preservation creates a gulf between her and the women she once knew. She is cut off from their solace, their shared understanding.  And the deception deepens. Olivia, drawn to the illusion of Cesario, mistakes her for Sebastian, her heart entangled in a web of misdirection.  And Orsino, her affections tangled with the fabricated persona, yearns for a love that cannot be.\n\nIs this a modern lens we see through, or is there something deeper at play? Perhaps the play hints at suppressed desires, emotions lurking beneath the surface, brought to light by the artifice of Viola's disguise.  Does Olivia's attraction to Cesario stem from a deeper truth, a secret longing? Or is it a reflection of the shallowness of the world around her, a world that judges by appearances alone?\n\nWhen the mask falls, and the truth is revealed, Olivia's affections shift with the ease of a summer breeze, from Cesario to Sebastian.  She embraces Viola as sister, the deception forgiven, the bonds of blood taking precedence.",
            "The German hand, they say, was heavy on the land. Not for nothing did the whisper of genocide hang over the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. But an empire, vast and sprawling, can't be measured by such simple reckonings. The German dominion was a patchwork, its policies and ways as varied as the landscapes it claimed. And so it was with education. Some lands, like East Africa, saw the Kaiser's hand in schools and literacy, a bloom of knowledge under the watchful eye of the state. Others, well, others were left to the tending of missionaries, their faith a meager harvest in the arid plains.\n\nSouth West Africa was one such land. Not the grand schools of Tanganyika, where the natives were groomed under the watchful gaze of the crown. Here, the task fell to men of God, their offerings sparse, their reach limited. The Kaiser, however, saw to the education of his own, a system of state schools erected, a careful hand guiding the missionaries. The long shadow of this division stretched far into the future, even after the German eagle had flown. While other lands boasted men of letters, South West Africa remained largely untouched, the vast majority unlettered, unschooled, their destinies bound to the unforgiving earth.\n\nThis land, this South West Africa, was a study in contrasts. It asks the question: what forces shaped this divergence? What lay in the hearts of those who claimed ownership, those who sought to mold the destinies of others? This paper seeks to explore those answers, to plumb the depths of history and uncover the truths hidden beneath the sands of time.\n\nThe tales of German education are many, spun in German tongue and penned by those who lived it. They speak of systems, of structures, of the ways knowledge was dispensed. Later, voices from beyond the German borders echoed these stories, comparing and contrasting, dissecting the tapestry of colonial education.  Among these voices, Cohen's stands out, a beacon in the darkness. He peered into the heart of South West Africa and East Africa, seeking the reasons behind their differing trajectories. The answer, he found, lay in the settlers, their numbers, their desires.\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to other colonies, held a temperate embrace, though the desert stretched across much of its face. It was a land that drew the European to its shores. By 1913, nearly fifteen thousand whites had found a home there, a far cry from the five thousand in East Africa, the next most populated colony.",
            "The music called Popular, a hundred years spilled across the land,  has come to wear a thousand faces.  Rock and rap, country and jazz, folk and a hundred whispers in between. Each a tangled knot of branches, bearing sub-genres and sub-sub-genres like fruit heavy on the bough. \n\nHeavy metal, born in the furnace of the last forty years, sings a song of darkness. Its voice, a cacophony of noise and feeling, leans into the shadows. It is a music of excess, a hunger for more, more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality.  It erupted from the earth, a fist clenched tight, demanding to be heard. \n\nEarly on, men and women found the metal sound could bend, could be shaped to their will. Each carved a niche, a sub-genre, a voice within the roar. The branches spread, a tangled forest of sound.\n\nToday, the metal movement stands vast and complex.  Its roots lie buried deep, but its branches reach for the sky. To understand the metal of today, one must first know the metal of yesterday, the fire that birthed it.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a song of darkness. It is a music of the primal, the visceral, the raw. It is a music born of excess, of drugs and despair, of a hunger that cannot be satiated. The psychedelic haze of the seventies stirred the soul, birthing music that was both beautiful and terrifying. \n\nIt is a music that reminds us of the darkness within, the shadows that lurk at the edge of our vision. It is a music that does not shy away from the bleak realities of life, but embraces them, holds them up to the light. \n\nLyrics like those from \"Helter Skelter\" whisper of this darkness. The Beatles, those purveyors of sunshine and love, delved into the abyss, revealing the darkness that festered beneath the surface. A response to the Rolling Stones, a challenge to prove their own capacity for darkness. The metal seed was sown.",
            "The Surrealists came after him, painting their fractured visions. But Henri Rousseau, long before, was crafting dreams, both of the canvas and the heart.  His *The Dream*, painted in the year nineteen ten, it’s more than a woman at wonder in some painted landscape. It’s Rousseau himself, wrestling with those dreams, the yearnings he held, the hunger for acceptance that gnawed at him. Recognition.  Praise. The love of those who held the keys to the art world, that gilded cage he yearned to enter.  He dreamed it, this prize, and the cost. To conform, to mimic the strokes and styles of the masters, to bend his own vision to fit the mold. Or to stand alone, a singular voice in the clamor, a path carved by his own hand.\n\nThis *Dream*, it’s the echo of that struggle. To understand it, you must know the man. Born in Laval, France, in the year of our Lord eighteen forty-four. His father, a man of commerce, a tinsmith, a dealer. Rousseau, he knew none of that world. No formal schooling in the arts, just the tollbooth, the gabelou’s uniform, the steady rhythm of the coin-counting.\n\nThen, the grief came. A wife lost, eight children swallowed by the earth. A daughter, Julia, his only sun. He turned to painting, a refuge, a canvas to wash away the pain. Unlike the sentimentalists who romanticized the peasant, Rousseau, he was one of them.  He painted the world he knew, the dreams of the common man.\n\nHis hunger for acceptance was a raw thing. Uneducated, he arrived late to the game, surrounded by titans, men whose names were already whispered in galleries. Matisse, a name that would soon be etched in gold. While Matisse feared banality, Rousseau craved the conventional, the safe harbor of the accepted.\n\nHe wanted to be one of them, to be welcomed into the fold. To be more than just a douanier, more than a man who painted dreams. He wanted to be seen, to be heard, to be called an artist.",
            "Many a scholar, many a soul has pondered the kinship, the blood tie, between the things of right and the things of beauty. Truth and grace, hand in hand. Like Keats whispered in his ode,  \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”  We learn much from books and experience, but these truths, these ethics and aesthetics, they seem to seep in without schooling. Like rumors in the wind, or the scent of blood on the breeze. They are descriptions, not commandments. We study beauty and morality not to build cages, but to understand the wild things within. \n\nWe talk of a masterpiece's worth, dissecting it like a frog on a tabletop, foreground, background, context, all laid bare. But does knowing these things tell you why it sings? Why it haunts you? When someone speaks of a favorite song, a favorite story, you hear it: \"There’s just something about it.\"  Something that sits beyond the bone, beyond the words. \n\nLike Flannery O'Connor said, a story is a way to say what can't be said plain. A statement falls short.  No matter how we paint the picture, there's a ghost in the room, a whisper in the dark.  Ethics too, has this ghost. Wittgenstein saw it: \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" \n\nThis \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, this is what makes art and morality sing. This is the bridge between them. We feel them, deep in the marrow, in a way we can't quite explain, a truth that sings in the blood.  Literature, it’s the purest form. It lives and breathes our values, our hopes and our sins. It’s a mirror held up to the soul.",
            "The land they call Germany now, a place of strength and unity, a tapestry woven from the high peaks of München down to the brine-kissed shores of Kiel. The thread runs through Köln, a city carved from the Rhine's embrace, and on to Dresden, a stone sentinel on the Elbe. A culture distinct, born of many sources, many tribes.\n\nGermania. The name itself hangs heavy with shadows, a whisper of origins lost to the wind. Scholars and men of history argue its birth, each with a theory to offer. Tacitus, the chronicler, claimed it from a tribe known as the Tungrians, who crossed the Rhine, their swords stained crimson from Gaulish blood (Tacitus, 98).  Caesar, conqueror of Gaul, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his grim chronicles of war, a marker to distinguish those he had subdued from those who still held their freedom. He took it from the Gauls themselves, a word to mark the untamed. In his first book, Caesar writes, \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others whisper of a spear, the \"ger,\" a weapon of war, or of a Gaelic cry, \"garim,\" meaning to shout, a testament to the Germans' fierce voices. \n\nTacitus, in his tome \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" penned in the year 98, spoke of a people untouched, unmixed. \"I should regard them as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" He saw it as a land of harsh beauty, a place where men would not willingly choose to settle unless it was their birthright. \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98). \n\nRome, with its vast empire, saw Germania as a source of wealth, a place to raid and exploit. They sent their legions, driven by the hunger for gold and glory, but ultimately, they returned to the heart of their domain. The Germanic tribes, they remained, living on the edges of the empire, trading their wares, their skills honed in the crucible of war, serving in the ranks of the Roman legions (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "The world below, a tableau of dull brown. I looked down, the scene etched in my mind with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel. Thoughts, like moths, flitted in and out, never settling, never taking root. The mind, a clear and cold pool of observation.\n\nAn artist once told me 'draw on the right side of the brain.' He gave me a book, bound in yellowed paper, its title promising secrets - The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I, a boy of six, dreamt of drawing. Now, the book lay open, its diagrams a map to a world I could not yet navigate. It spoke of frames, of simplifying the chaos into manageable forms. A bowl of fruit, say, reduced to a simple plane.\n\nBut the bowl before me, it held no simple plane. It was a vastness, a chasm of brown.  Picasso in his blue phase, Monet with his greens, the Renaissance masters with their riot of colors - they all had their hues. My hue was brown. This, the beginnings. This, the story. Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand, a tool of creation, trembled. Muscles tensed, uncoiled, seeking form. The water, a mirror, reflecting my intent. A swirl, a shudder, a flake breaking away, drifting into the void. Muscles tightened, a spasm, a jolt. The handle of the toilet. A desperate, clawing motion. The brown refuse, glued to the porcelain, mocking me.\n\nMop in hand, tie choking my throat, I stared. A message, a testament to human waste, left for the cleaners. More flushes, more silence. A hand reached for the wall, the paper trailing like a shroud. A cocoon, a shield.\n\nStanding, bending, dipping my hand into the bowl, a mother into a fiery oven.",
            "The young are dying behind the wheel. A confluence of factors, a dark vector of statistics, points to this grim reality. The learned men at the Institutes say the teen brain, it ain't built for the road. Inexperience, raw and untempered, sits at the heart of it. More than just crashes, it breeds rollovers, speed, and a hunger to run off the blacktop.\n\nAnd they drive with their kind.  A fact as plain as the sun. The folks down in California, they did some lookin' and found a truth as hard as gravel: the younger the passenger, the higher the chance of a wreck.\n\nStates, they've tried to stanch the flow. Provisional licenses, curfews, limits on young company. But these are just patches on a hole in the soul. The young, they're not ready. By all measure, they ain't fit for the weight of the wheel. Even eighteen, a man named Zuckerman says, is too young. He's seen it, studied it.  These young ones, they crave the rush, the edge of the blade.  It's in their blood.\n\nSo what's the answer? Delay. Wait till the hunger for the thrill fades, till the recklessness abates. We keep givin' them keys, we'll be drownin' in their blood. The Boomers' young'uns, they're comin' of age. Millions of them, ready to take the wheel.\n\nThe fix ain't hard.  Schools can teach, but no child under eighteen, no sir, should be allowed to drive.  A permit, a trial run, maybe, but not the full license. Hours behind the wheel, supervised, logged.  California, they do it right.\n\nIt's a simple matter, really. A national standard, a law clear as day. Protect the young, protect us all. Why, it ain't rocket science.",
            "The Library of Congress held a trove of Edison’s early films, flickering ghosts of a vanished age. Fifteen trick films, they called them.  From the year 1895 to 1901, these phantoms played upon the screen, their illusions spun from the threads of edited moments. I watched them, these ghosts of the nascent cinema, their poetics unraveling before me.  Most were bound by the stage, confined within the frame of a proscenium, the camera a silent sentinel, immobile. Long shots, medium shots, these were their domain. Close-ups, the intimacy of a whispered secret, were absent, a world too vast for such scrutiny. One shot, one film, the rule seemed to be. Each a vignette, a fleeting moment captured in time. A minute or less, a blink in eternity.\n\nBut there were whispers of rebellion, flickers of change. Some dared to break the mold, to introduce the audacity of multiple shots, stitching together moments to weave a more complex tapestry. The stage remained, the proscenium arch a constant, a boundary that confined the figures within.  They moved side to side, like puppets on a string, never venturing towards or from the lens.  Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, a film from the year 1900, a good example.  They entered from the right, their forms swallowed by the darkness, then reappeared, moving back and forth, bound to the stage's confines. The camera, a watchful eye, never followed.\n\nThe trick films were echoes of the theatre, of vaudeville’s magic and illusion. The audience, like spectators in a grand hall, saw the whole, framed by the proscenium's embrace.  A single “shot” could be a symphony of moments, joined invisibly to create the illusion of apparition, of disappearing acts. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, one of the earliest of these phantoms. The severed “head” appears in a moment, a single shot, but a closer inspection reveals the stitching, the joining of moments, the illusion carefully constructed.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the soil, was a firebrand for Republicanism. Though his life was bound to the rhythm of the fields, that same life, brief as it was in the halls of power, forged a man known for his unwavering convictions. Freedom was the seed he tended, both in the realm of man and in the machinations of government. His faith in the agrarian way was the bedrock of his convictions, shaping his pronouncements on sovereignty, on the very nature of the Constitution, on the scales of justice.\n\nHe saw in the new nation a chance to build something true, unburdened by the ghosts of ancient customs.  The ground was fertile, unmarred, ready to bear the fruit of self-government.  He held fast to the natural rights of man, a creed as immutable as the laws of nature itself. He saw them as a chain, indivisible, fragile.  If one link was broken, the whole would fray and weaken. These rights, he argued, must be kept beyond the reach of man's own designs, for they were the very essence of his being. He scoffed at the notion of a \"state of nature,\" where the strong preyed on the weak, where cunning was a shield against the brute force of the world.  Civilization, he believed, demanded a higher order.\n\nTo build this ideal, Taylor envisioned a government that understood the duality of human nature.  Good and evil resided within each man, a constant struggle.  He held fast to this duality, a rigid moral compass guiding his every thought.  Government, he argued, could not escape the imperfections of its creators.  \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.\"  He saw good principles in the protection of private property, in the nurturing of the land, in the curbing of unchecked ambition.  A government founded on these principles, he believed, would function justly, despite the inevitable flaws of its administrators, for they would be swayed by the twin demons of avarice and self-interest.\n\nSelf-interest, he argued, was the engine that drove men, but it was only when it festered, when it bent the human heart towards the destruction of the common good, that it became a scourge.  A good government, he believed, was necessary to contain this inherent darkness, to act as a watchful sentinel against the creeping corruption of power.\n\nLike many of his Republican brethren, Taylor was a champion of strict construction.  He envisioned a Federal government limited in scope, its powers confined to the explicit pronouncements of the Constitution.  He saw an expansive government as a breeding ground for tyranny, a bottomless pit of expense and corruption.  Yet, he warned against a rigid, literal interpretation, for it could be a path to ruin.  He sought a deeper understanding, a grasp of the intent of the framers, a respect for the spirit behind the words.  And he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the nation, a testament to the sovereignty of the states, a beacon of liberty in a world yearning for freedom.",
            "The graph, Figure 17, showed a sudden drop in the commuter logs come the third month. A dispiriting sight. The reasons, hard to say. Winter had settled on the New England campus, a chill in the air that kept folks off bikes and out of the cold. December, the semester's end, found everyone consumed: papers due, grades looming. The log, a forgotten thing. And then came the holidays, a month-long break, campus emptied, no need to tread the paths. Classes resumed in late January, yet the logs remained scarce. \n\nThe drop in February, that was a mystery. Projects, they run hot at first, then cool. A natural thing. So we tried to stoke the fire. Carpool Challenge Week in March, a blitz of prizes and pleas. It worked. The logs climbed. \n\nBut the lesson was clear: keeping a project alive, that's a fight. The ebb and flow of semester breaks, the slow creep of indifference, these are enemies to be reckoned with.\n\nAnother foe: the car. A freedom, a comfort, woven into the fabric of this country. To win folks away, you need more than good intentions.  \n\nWe offered prizes, gift certificates to cafes, shops, a massage here and there. Maybe something bigger would have helped - a bike, a hybrid car, even an electric one.  The prizes, they stayed the same. But what if they had grown? A bike announced in December, a hybrid in January. Maybe then, the logs wouldn't have dwindled.",
            "The Exchange Traded Fund. A thing of metal and paper, a security they say, designed to mimic the dance of the market. A basket of holdings, an index, a commodity, all bound together and traded like the single stock it ain’t.  It offers the broad stroke of the index fund, they say, but with the tools of the individual - shorting, margin, all the tricks of the trade at your fingertips, all for a fraction of the cost.  \n\nBut there’s a price, always a price.  Each trade, a commission paid, like a toll on the road to riches. And even with these supposed benefits, the question hangs heavy: does the diversification truly exist? Does it hold true, or is it a phantom, a whisper in the wind?\n\nWe’ll look at this IHF, a creature of the market, and dissect its top ten holdings, the beasts that make up its flesh and blood.  These ten, they account for a good portion of the whole, 63.58% they claim. We’ll see if they truly represent the creature, if they can stand on their own, if they offer a path to profit that surpasses the sum of its parts.\n\nWe’ll measure their return, their beta, these metrics of risk and reward. And we’ll see if a portfolio built from these same ten, in the same proportions, can beat the creature itself. Can it offer a higher return, a lower risk?  \n\nThe numbers will tell the tale, or at least they’ll offer a glimpse into the shadows.",
            "The land of dreams, so Poe called it.  One of his better poems, he claimed. In \"Dream-Land,\" he casts a word, \"Thulé,\" into the verses, a word traced back by Mabbott to the lips of Virgil. Virgil, speaking of an island north of Britain, a place the Greeks held as the edge of knowing.  Virgil used it, that's certain. But there's a newer source, one to which credit must be given. Poe, he was drawn to the words of the Germans. \n\nThis reference, it speaks to Poe's familiarity with Goethe's own dark musings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" he draws a line between their words, suggests Poe was mimicking the master. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature, it tells us of Goethe, celebrated writer of the tragic drama \"Faust,\" a work split into two parts, the first in 1808, the second with the author's own passing in 1832. Within the second part, a short poem, \"The King of Thulé.\" A king grieving his wife, who offered him a goblet as a gift, now drinks deeply and weeps. He decides his time has come and gives his possessions to his children, save for the goblet.  He walks to a precipice, casts the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and falls. The King of Thulé, his demeanor, his very being, mirrored in the shadowy figure of Poe's \"Dream-Land.\"  A dark reflection, perhaps, of Poe's own loss and his solace in drink.\n\nFaust, it also found its way onto the stage, woven into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, less than a year before Poe himself used the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nTwice Poe summons \"Thulé\" in his own writings. Once he speaks of \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land\" it sits, bookends to the poem.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land,\" they stand as companions, their verses echoing one another. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker walks into that bleak landscape, haunted by the ghosts of friends departed. He sees a world drained of color, a world of shadows.  These are the echoes of \"The King of Thulé,\" a man consumed by grief, a king lost in the darkness following his wife's death. The entire poem, it reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's own lament.\n\nGoethe, a giant in literature, a figure Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his admiration for Tennyson.   Poe once said, when asked of Tennyson, “I have read his poetry with the utmost interest….”\n\nAnd beyond that connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's works in the many reproductions that were blossoming in those years.",
            "The law in this sun-bleached state says a man might find redress, might find justice, if he were to fall, a victim to the slick treachery of spilled applesauce. The question then becomes, could this man, this Palmer,  win more than just the coin for his hurt? Could he wrest from the pockets of the store, the D&D, a sum meant as punishment? \n\nA judge, he might not be quick to dismiss this claim. Palmer must show the manager, Martin, acted not merely carelessly, but with a deliberate indifference, a cold heart. The law speaks of \"willful and conscious disregard\" -  a man who knows the danger and chooses to ignore it. And \"despicable\" too, it must be, this conduct.\n\nPalmer will say Martin knew the danger. Six times before, men and women had stumbled, fallen, victim to the same treacherous slickness.  Six times, and still Martin, he lingered over his dinner, ignoring the pleas of his own men. \n\nOn that day, the thirteenth of October, the air heavy with the scent of apples and something else, something darker,  Wayne told Martin of the spill. Martin, he mumbled about his dinner, about the complaints of men, as if they were bothersome flies. Haddigan, another, she too brought word of the danger. Same answer, same disinterest. And then, at half past five, Palmer, she slipped.  A broken back. A shattered life.\n\nThe law in this land, it speaks of malice, of oppression, of a disregard for the safety of others. A cold disregard, a willful one.  Will the court find it here? Will they see the malice in Martin's indifference?",
            "Four years gone. A semester at CBC, dust swirling in the air like desert sand. Islam. The word hung heavy in the classroom, a question mark echoing in the faces of the young. Was it a religion of peace or a fist raised in the name of God? A question that gnawed then, even more so now. \n\nThe world spun its kaleidoscope. After the smoke cleared, the media shifted, a pendulum swinging from suspicion to an acceptance bordering on worship. Could a man like Obama, a name whispered with both reverence and fear, a name touched by the shadow of Islam, have ever risen to the highest office? Unthinkable in the before-time.\n\nThe Prophet's story, a tapestry woven with threads of history and faith, intrigued me. I'd heard tales of a warrior, a conqueror who carved a path with the edge of his sword, forcing men to kneel before Allah. But this biography painted a different picture, a martyr misunderstood, a man who humbled himself before the gaze of the world.  And slowly, like moths drawn to a flickering flame, they came, drawn to the light of his words.\n\nThe echoes of Jesus resonated in the miracle tales, the loaves and fishes multiplied, the water turned to wine. But here, the shepherd offered mutton and milk, a simple feast for forty men. A subtle shift, a whisper of an alternative.  Did they seek to elevate him, to paint him as a prophet who needed no proof, only the quiet hum of truth? A silent theft, a shadow play cast upon the life of Christ.\n\nAnd the stories, whispered from man to man, each a layer of gauze obscuring the truth.  A chain of witnesses, each link a fading memory. Did this lend credence or cast doubt?  Was this the mark of truth, or the echo of a carefully crafted narrative?\n\nThe most unsettling thing, the thing that gnawed at the edges of my mind, was the attempt to elevate Muhammad. To paint him as a gentle shepherd, a sage, a man of peace. A man who, history whispered, was forged in the fire of conquest. Could those who followed him truly know the truth, the man behind the myth?",
            "The man called Jesus. His words. His way.  Left behind, they were, in the dust of his passing.  Christianity, a thing of slow, inexorable change, drifted from its moorings.  The world, it writhes and twists, ever forward, ever changing.  The old ways cling, stubborn as weeds, but their hold weakens.  A yearning will bloom, a hunger in the hearts of men. A seeking after the root, the source, the wellspring before the waters ran thick with dogma.  Decades, centuries perhaps, but the tide will turn. Backwards.  Layer by layer, the accretions will fall away, until only the bare bones remain.  The bones of Jesus. The bones of God's word as he spoke it.  A vast movement, a tide of souls returning to the shore.  \n\nThe church, the institution, it will endure.  But the things within, the tangled vines of belief, will be pruned.  Uniformity will rise from the ashes of diversity.  One faith, one voice.  History, it is a river, ever flowing, ever changing course.  Persecution to power, from shackles to leadership, the wheel turns.  Now it turns again, towards the source.  Towards Jesus.   \n\nThe key lies in the words.  Not as stone tablets, immutable and cold, but as whispered truths, echoes of a timeless well.  \n\nBefore Jesus, before the man, there was the seed.  Judaism.  Monotheism, a single God, a single truth.  The scriptures, a wellspring of ancient wisdom.  Divisions within, yes. Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots.  But a unity of core belief.  The foundation.",
            "The muck of man. That's what Sinclair lays bare in *The Jungle*. Greed, a sickness, it consumes them all, these men with their factories and their dreams of empires. They build their towers of brick and steel, spitting smoke into the belly of the sky, heedless of the blight it brings. The river of their industry runs black, poisoned with the waste of their hunger.  They see no man, no beast, only profit. \n\nTheir hands, stained with the sweat and blood of the working man, count only the coins. Loyalty? Decency?  Faded words in the clang and clatter of the gears. Here, a man is a cog, a replaceable part in their machine. Hours bleed into days, days into years. A layoff, a whisper on the wind, and a family left to starve.  No law to shield them, no hand to pull them from the mire.\n\nSinclair paints a picture of a hell on earth, a Packingtown choked by its own ambition. The workers, chained not by iron but by circumstance, are but ghosts in a city of shadows. They toil, they bleed, they die, their cries swallowed by the roar of industry.  He calls them slaves, and the word rings true, for what is man but a slave to his own desires, a slave to the system that grinds him down?",
            "The writer, he crafts worlds with language.  Shapes the reader's heart with the words he chooses. Some paths are truer than others. Fitzgerald, he knew this. In *The Great Gatsby*, he spins a tapestry of meaning, threads of gold and green, white and gray, red and pink. He builds a language of symbol, a whispers of what lies beneath. And the colors, they sing a song of longing and decay.\n\nFitzgerald paints white and gray, not as they are, but as they become.  White, a brittle purity, the sheen of something higher. Gray, the dust of time, the fading of dreams. It hangs in the air from the first page. Daisy, Jordan, they are cloaked in white.  Nick, he wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, a white shirt, a ghost in the throng.  And the only time the white fades, it's in the gaudy hues of Gatsby's hollow revelry.\n\nHe paints the world in shades of meaning. The canyons of the city, white chasms. Names on a timetable, gray, lost in the churn.  Catherine's apartment, a white shard in a city of white.  Even the child of the railroad, a whisper of gray.  And the old man selling dogs, his face weathered, his soul gray. \n\nAnd then he uses it.  He uses white and gray to define Daisy.  After a long silence, she reappears, a shimmer of white. A little white roadster, a ghost in the summer heat.  She is no longer a woman, but a longing, a phantom of Gatsby's desire.  The haze of her fur collar, gray, a veil over her true self.  White again, before the confrontation, a spectral figure in the gathering storm.",
            "The sun beat down on San Diego County, baking the soil and coaxing life from the earth. A land of plenty, they called it. Tomatoes fattened on the vine, citrus trees hung heavy with fruit, and leafy greens unfurled in the gentle breeze. Squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers – the bounty was vast.  And there were those who sought to cultivate it with a touch lighter than the hand of industry.\n\nWord had spread of a different kind of farm, one that eschewed the chemical kiss of progress for the slow, patient rhythm of nature.  Organic, they called it. Community Supported Agriculture, a network of folks willing to pay a premium for a slice of the earth's honest gift. Waiting lists stretched long, a testament to the yearning for something more, something real.\n\nEggs laid by hens roaming free, milk drawn from cows grazing on sun-drenched pastures, these were the staples of a simpler time, a time when man walked more lightly on the land. Farms became sanctuaries, offering more than just sustenance. Trails wound through fields of ripening vegetables, inviting weary souls to escape the city's clamor. Birdsong filled the air, a chorus of life undisturbed by the hum of machinery.\n\nThis, they believed, was the way forward. A way to heal the land, to nourish the body and the soul, and to build a future where man and nature could exist in harmony.\n\nBut the path wasn't easy. Organic farming demanded more, a constant vigilance against pests and weeds, a tireless nurturing of the soil.  The yields were often less, the costs higher. Yet, the reward was more than just a profit. It was the satisfaction of knowing that one was part of something larger, something enduring. \n\nThe land itself held secrets, whispered tales of ancient peoples who had walked these paths before. Cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers had come and gone, leaving their mark on the landscape.  Now, a new chapter was about to begin. A chapter marked by the promise of a future where the earth's bounty could once again be shared with all who sought it.",
            "Culture. A word that hangs heavy, a shroud. A ghost whispering in the halls of men. What it is, what it ain't, a riddle wrapped in a riddle.  Not a single thing, not a uniform fabric. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, that's a lie told by fools. It's the shadows and the silences that matter, the way a culture breathes, the way it bleeds. A stranger comes to a foreign land, and he sees it through the lens of his own experience. Comparisons bloom like weeds.\n\nTo understand another, you gotta dig deep. History, prejudices, the roots that bind them. You can't judge, you can't change. You can only accept. The boundaries are set. Especially at the table, where men trade goods and souls.  A weaker hand, a foreign tongue - respect for the way things are, that's your only shield.\n\nBut culture ain't confined to borders. It lives in the walls of a house, in the steel and glass cages we call companies. Some grind men down, some let them breathe. Dress codes, the way words are strung together, the way tasks are passed from hand to hand - these are the whispers of a company's soul.  Look at America, a land of contradictions, where even within the same city, the air can taste different.\n\nValues. That's the heart of it. Why a man acts, why he flinches, why he bargains hard. To save face, to keep the peace, that's one culture. To strike a blow, to claim victory, that's another. Before you sit across from a man, you gotta know his why.\n\nBut the deepest knowledge comes from the man himself.  A name, a story, a glimpse into the soul. That's what makes the table sing. That's what makes a deal worthwhile.",
            "The fool's words echoed in the mind: there is no God. A whisper from the Psalms, a seed planted by the hand of the ancients. Anselm, that seeker of truth, took those words and twisted them, spun them into a web to catch the Almighty. But Aquinas, the man of reason, he scoffed at such shadows. He sought proof in the dust and the light, in the motion and the stillness.\n\nTwo men, two roads, both converging on the same destination: the face of the Creator. But their journeys were as different as fire and ice. Anselm, he looked inward, into the dark chambers of the soul. He claimed that God resided there, a hidden truth revealed only to those who dared to seek. Faith, he called it, a leap into the void.  \n\nAquinas, he looked outward, at the world laid bare before him. He saw the gears turning, the cause and effect, the echo of design in the chaos. He spoke of logic, of proof. Five arguments, he laid them out, each a stone in a wall built against doubt.\n\nBut do these walls hold? Does faith truly illuminate the darkness, or does it merely create an illusion of light? And can reason, cold and calculating, ever truly grasp the Divine? The answer, like God himself, remains elusive.",
            "The prince born into the world sometime in the dark half-life of the fifth century, before the counting of Christ, would one day be known as Buddha. He cast off the world, seeking solace in the silence. His words, carried on the wind, took root and blossomed into Buddhism, a faith as old as the mountains themselves. Theravada, the oldest branch, still clings to the bones of his teachings, though the flesh has changed. \n\nThis is seen in Sri Lanka, a land where the monks still perform the water-cutting ceremony, a rite as ancient as the island's heart, though Buddha himself spoke nothing of such things. The changes run deep, from the painted faces of the faithful to the very essence of their salvation. Both the cloistered and the lay, bound by the same thread of faith, have had to bend the doctrines to fit the shape of a changing world. \n\nTo understand this we must speak in riddles, for there are forces at play both within and without the fold. Internal forces, born of the heart of the Buddhasasana, monastic or lay, they shape the faith from within. External forces, from those who do not tread the same path, come bearing gifts or shadows. Hostile forces, they seek to wound the heart of the faith, fueled by misunderstanding and malice. Benign forces, they may mean no harm, yet their touch can soothe or scar. \n\nWe speak first of the core, the bedrock of Theravada. Refuge is found in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, the teachings, slumber in the three baskets: the Suttas, the Vinaya, and the Abhidhamma. The Suttas contain the words of the Buddha, the Vinaya the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma, the secrets of the mind, where concepts like Anatta – no self – and Dukkha – the eternal ache of being – find their dwelling. Only by understanding these truths, the impermanence of all things, can one escape the wheel of Sansara, the endless cycle of birth and death.  \n\nWith Sansara, the serpent of desire, lobha, the viper of hatred, dosa, and the fog of delusion, moha, will finally be laid to rest. In the Vinaya, the path is laid out, the rules for living, five for the lay and many more for those who walk the monastic road.  \n\nBut the heart of it all, the pivot on which the world turns, is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha, the truth of suffering. Second, that craving is the root of suffering. Third, that this suffering can be overcome. Fourth, that the path to overcome suffering is the Eightfold Path.",
            "The borderlands between the two republics, America and Mexico, had known a long and bitter feud. Fifty-seven years it stretched, from the year '36 to the turn of the century, a time when rifle smoke and red blood stained the earth. The War, they called it, a war that saw the young and hungry nation carve out its dominion westward, swallowing Texas and the sun-baked lands of the Southwest. It was a war born of clashing creeds, a struggle between the old world and the new, between the ways of the Cross and the ways of the frontier.  \n\nBefore the bells of war tolled, there were skirmishes, raids, whispers of discontent. The men on both sides, fueled by a hunger for land and a thirst for power, found themselves locked in a dance of violence, a macabre waltz that echoed through the canyons and deserts.\n\nThe old grudges, born of the Spanish and English, lingered like a bad smell in the air. A shadow cast by the past, it darkened the path to understanding. The borderlands, a place of both promise and peril, became a stage for this age-old drama.\n\nAnd as the years wore on, the rivalry waned, not with a bang but a whimper. Mexico, bound by necessity, found itself tethered to the American eagle. The hunger for land had been replaced by a hunger for profit, and the shadow of war receded into the dust.",

A choice made out of need, a yearning for the kind of safety that had eluded me as a child.  \"Always a job, people always ailing,\" they'd say.  A mantra to ease the ache of uncertainty. But the science, the words, that was the pull, a yearning for knowledge. Still, the safe harbor of nursing beckoned.\n\nNow, at forty-six, alone, pockets bare, the sickness had taken hold. Fifteen years on that thin thread of Social Security, and nothing left to call my own.  A day-to-day struggle, a gnawing fear that claws at the edges of security, safety, even self-worth. Nothing certain anymore, yet one thing rings true: I wouldn't have weathered this storm without the hands that pulled me up, the love and solace of family and friends.  A stark reminder, when the world turns dark, how little strength we truly possess.\n\nLife, it throws its punches. Big and small, they come without warning. No wall can hold back the tide. Preparedness is a virtue, yes, but some things are beyond the reach of even the sturdiest shelter.\n\nThe talk of rugged individualism, of self-reliance, it echoes through the halls of power. But the bones of this nation weren't built on isolation. They were forged in the fires of compassion, in the shared burdens and the lifting hands of neighbors. Those pioneers, they crossed the vast plains not by going it alone, but by the strength of their shared purpose.\n\nSo yes, be ready. Stock your shelves, gather your supplies.  Candles, flints, canned goods, water.  A fire in the belly, a fire in the hearth. But while you prepare for the storm, remember the faces around you. The ones who stand beside you, the ones who might need your hand. That, too, is a kind of preparation.",
            "The why of it, the how of it, this shaping of life. What binds it, what bends it? D'Arcy Thompson, back in '17, he said the zoologist barely dreamt of speaking of life in numbers. The words still ring true. But now, they try. They try to mimic the dance of the shell, the slow build of the mollusk, with equations and lines. Raup and Stanley, they took a crack at it, back in '81, with their models of belly-housing. Our work, it follows that path. We look at *Prunum*, the spiral-shelled kind, and ask how the numbers tell the story. We use the ghosts of shells, captured in X-ray, to tease out the measure of their form. We feed these bones of data into CerioShell, Stone's program, and watch the forms shift, grow, change. We want to know what the limits are, the boundaries of possibility. What can a shell become? And how does it become it? This, we try to piece together, with the whispers of the shell and the language of the machine. \n\nA shell, it's a journey through time and space, a tube winding, turning, ever-spiraling. Each turn, a whorl, a whisper of the past, clinging to the imaginary line of the columella, the heart of the spiral. The whorls grow, some faster, some slower, separated by sutures, fine lines marking the passage of time. The last whorl, the body whorl, the one holding the flesh, the one we see first. The rest, the spire, a record of the journey before. The apex, the tip of the spire, the beginning. The base, the end, the mouth of the world. And through it all, the aperture, the opening, the breath of the creature.\n\nWe look at the shell from every angle, apical, basal, apertural, abapertural. The usual way, the shell face tilted towards us, the apex reaching towards the heavens. \n\nCounting the whorls, it's like tracing the steps of a ghost. Start at the apex, the first suture, a line dividing the past from the present. Count the whorls from there, each one a quarter of a story.\n\nThe shell, it's a series of apertures, a path through time and space, each whorl a marker, a place where the creature touched the world. We chart this path, the center of each aperture, the radius, the dimensions of its world. We make it speak in numbers, in equations. And with these numbers, we can change it, twist it, make it new.",
            "The bones of the infant and the child.  In Indonesia they lay still for a decade, these numbers.  The country, it crawls toward the sunlight of those distant goals, the Millennium promises of water and clean earth. But the mothers and the young, their fate hangs by a thread. The road to salvation by 2015 is long and shadowed. \n\nThe reasons for this failing, they whisper in the wind.  A broken system, not a program, demands fixing.  \n\nThey speak of midwives, skilled in the old ways, tending the births of seventy-two percent of the children.  But skill is a hollow word when the storm breaks, when the mother bleeds.  The old ways cannot mend what the modern age can.  And the children, the young ones, they wither from the unseen demons of diarrhea.  Forgotten in the afterbirth, the mothers too, abandoned by the hand of care.  \n\nThe knife, the cold steel of the surgeon's blade, it finds its mark in the cities, seven percent.  But in the fields, where the sun bleeds red, it's a mere two.  A chasm opens between the haves and the have-nots, a wound in the fabric of the land.  The rich, they feast on health, the poor, they starve.  A gulf of twenty-seven percent, a stark reminder of the price of poverty.\n\nNow the question hangs, a shadow in the air:  programs or a system?  The quick fix, the targeted blow, it beckons.  But it's a siren song, luring them to shallow waters.  The money flows, it dries the wells of other fields, leaving only dust and despair.  The body, it is not a collection of parts, but a whole, a singular entity.  The programs, they are splintered shards, failing to see the truth.",
            "The Victorian age. A time of lace and lords, of detail spun fine as cobwebs and manners stiff as starched collars. Yet even in that gilded cage, certain stories took flight, wings clipped but still beating, stories that dared to veer from the gilded path.\n\nTake *Oliver Twist*, for instance, or *Wuthering Heights*. Both whisper of shadows, of things unseen that claw at the edges of reason.  They are novels of mystery,  of the bizarre blooming in the heart of the ordinary. This is what gives them their edge, their bite. The characters, trapped within their own labyrinthine worlds, writhe beneath the surface. Their desires, their fears, they are laid bare, exposed like raw nerves.\n\nDickens, he knew how to burrow into the mind, how to pull out the gristle and sinew of a soul. This passage, a glimpse into Oliver's fractured consciousness:\n\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nHe's adrift, lost in a sea of pain and confusion. The line between reality and nightmare blurs, the shooting, the faces of Sikes and Crackit, all swirling together in a maelstrom of terror. It's a potent image, the boy helpless, a puppet in the hands of fate. This is the heart of the mystery, the question that gnaws at the soul: who is pulling the strings?\n\nThe same thread, this dance with the unseen, runs through *Wuthering Heights*. Dreams bleed into reality, and the past, like a ghost, lingers in the shadows. But here, the mystery is more complex, more rooted in the characters themselves.\n\nThey are creatures of passion, consumed by dark desires, driven by a hunger that can never be satiated.  Theirs is a world of secrets, of forbidden love, and of revenge that echoes through generations.  They are trapped, not just by circumstance, but by their own tormented souls.",
            "Two years gone now. Worked the after-school shift, tutoring the young ones. English and reading, that's where I found my footing.  A boy, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, came to me. Couldn't read a lick. Strange, it was. Some letters, he'd pronounce clear as a bell, others, like they were foreign. He spoke English good as any, but reading, it was a wall. Latino, I reckoned, though the boy spoke no Spanish to my ears. We wrestled with it, day after day, till one afternoon, the boy's mother walked in. Didn't speak a word of English. Just Spanish. Me, barely a whisper of the tongue myself. But then, it hit me. Like a load of bricks. The boy, he could read fine.  He just didn't know the English letters. Never did figure if it helped him much, though I hope he's doing alright.\n\nThat's the thing about language, see. It ain't always plain as day. Even for a boy who speaks it smooth, reading, it can be a birth-giving ache.  California's got a problem, a wall of tongues. What to do about it? Adrian, he needed simple things: English reading, the alphabet, the sounds. But the kids who barely speak it, now that's a different beast. No single answer fits. Dual language, immersion, tutors, ESL. Each one a piece of the puzzle, but not the whole. \n\nDual language, that's a good start. Not just for the Spanish-speakers, mind you, but for all.  Those kids in two-way programs, they outpace their peers.  Folks fear it, say it's a waste, that the majority won't see a dime's worth.  But that's a lie. Make it the rule, not the exception, and everyone benefits. But how?  We ain't gonna make every teacher bilingual, are we? Unreasonable, that is.  But what if we had helpers, tutors, folks who spoke both tongues, to lend a hand?",
            "The world whispers of something vast, something beyond reckoning. A Presence. Some are ushered into pews, others into temples, still others left to grapple with it alone. Faith, a heirloom passed down, accepted or cast aside. Some hold tight to a creed, only to see it crumble in the face of the howling void.  We are adrift, each a lone vessel searching for a beacon in the dark. A compass in the chaos.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" he'd said, thin lips barely moving, eyes fixed on the rain drumming a mournful rhythm on the tin roof.  We sat on the porch, smoke curling from our cigarettes, the air thick with the smell of wet earth and decay. The gutters overflowed, drowning the wilted blooms along the edge of the boards. He stared out at the gray world, a haunted look in his eyes, lost in some half-remembered ache. He'd grown gaunt, his clothes hanging loose on his frame. His hair, once a thick thatch, now sparse, like the brushstrokes of a fading memory. He didn't meet my gaze, and I felt a cold knot in my chest. A fear I couldn't name, a fear of saying the words that would make it real, the words that would seal the bargain. So I sat beside him, drew closer, and watched the rain fall, swallowed by the twilight.\n\nHe went in December, five days after my twenty-second year. The treatments, the poison they pumped into him, had only bought him a few more months. Months of pain. What good was that? I thought, alone in the darkness, no prayers on my tongue. If God existed, he'd long since turned his back.\n\nI wouldn't watch him go. I couldn't bear to see the life that birthed me fade into the void. I would remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than they did. Better than his own kin. He wouldn't have wanted me there, a silent witness to his surrender.  I curled in the bed, a small, shivering thing, waiting for the word.\n\nNo word came.",
            "The Gothic, Watt called it an oxymoron. \"Old-New.\" A contradiction writ large. Praised and damned, dismissed as shallow and hailed for its dreadful grandeur.  Walpole, the first to christen it, saw the Gothic in the clash of the ancient and the modern. He wove it into the fabric of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" a tapestry of theatricality and nature's mimicry, a story born of shadows and moonlight.  \n\n Even then, \"Gothic\" was a word tossed about, a misnomer for a thousand things, past and present, a relic of a time deemed archaic. But in Walpole's hands, the ancient and the new found a strange harmony. The Gothic novel, with its intimate gaze into the soul, a window into the heart of man, it endured.  \n\nChivalry, that fading dream of knighthood, pulsed at the heart of it all. The training, the code, the idealized knight, a beacon in a world perceived as lacking its virtues.  The Gothic, in its yearning for a lost age, romanticized the past, a yearning for a purity that seemed to have vanished. \n\nWalpole, writing amidst the turmoil of his time, saw the decay, the moral rot that threatened to consume the present. He saw it in Frederic, a prince, a survivor of tragedy, a figure cloaked in chivalric ideals, a man who embodied the virtues they had lost. A ghost of nobility in a world grown dark.  \n\nThe description of him, a litany of chivalric tropes, a prince, a victim, a warrior marked by loss. The gallant knight, exaggerated, pushed to the edge of excess, a harbinger of the dark theatricality to come.",
            "The flow.  It starts with the want. The call from the customer, a whisper in the wind.  Then the chase. For the raw stuff, the sinew and bone of the thing. The making. The forging. The sending out. This they call supply chain management. A term coined by a man named Oliver, back in the year 1982.  He spoke of planning, of control, of keeping the gears oiled and turning to satisfy the hunger of the wanting.\n\nSix things hold it together. Production, the heart of it all. Supply, the veins that feed the beast. Inventory, the marrow. Location, the bones. Transportation, the movement. And information, the whisper that guides the hand.\n\nProducers, they stand at the forge. They know what the people crave. They look to the market, a vast and shifting landscape, and read the signs. What will sell? How much? Where will it be born? These are the questions that drive them.\n\nThey choose the ground, the place where metal melts and shapes take form. They build the machines, and train the hands that wield them. Every detail a prayer, every bolt a hope. For if the steps are not taken in order, if the rhythm falters, the whole damn thing can collapse.\n\nTake Wal-Mart, for instance. Or Target. They have plans for everything. A blueprint for every action, every movement. Even the way a man ties his shoes. For in this world, order is everything.\n\nAnd then there's supply. The choice of who will feed the fire. Will it be done in-house, or will the work be cast out, sent to others? The manager weighs the options, seeking velocity. The speed of creation, the agility to adapt, the cost of it all.\n\nFor in the end, it's all about the flow. A river of goods, driven by the needs of men.",
            "The sign hung crooked, a rasping testament to a truth too stark for comfort.  \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it said. Ellen Page, face pale under the glare of the streetlights, stood clutching it. Burma, that land of jade and shadows, ruled by iron fists since '62, a coup's dark echo lingering still. Monks, robed in saffron, had dared to rise, a tide of yellow against the grey. The Saffron Revolution they called it, a whisper of hope choked by the steel of the junta.  \n\nThe air, thick with the scent of jasmine and fear, had tasted of violence. Monasteries, once sanctuaries, lay desecrated, their silence broken only by the ghosts of prayer. A Japanese lensman, Nagai, had seen too much, his camera a silent witness to the junta's wrath. A bullet silenced his voice, a stark footnote to the reign of terror.  \n\nThirteen, they said. The official count. A lie, whispered by the wind, carried on the backs of refugees. Colonel Win, a broken man, a ghost of the army he'd known, spoke of thousands swallowed by the earth. It was a song as old as time, this hunger for power, this thirst to crush dissent underfoot. Caesar, with his legions, the Japanese emperor, a god-king, and Bush, whispered to by Haggard, the shepherd of fools. A tapestry woven with threads of blood, stained by the hands of men who sought dominion. \n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of bodies crushed beneath the iron fist of the state. The whispers of 2,000, 3,000, lost in the official silence.  Rwanda, a genocide painted in the crimson of hate, where neighbor turned on neighbor, fueled by the poison of fear.  And Hitler's Germany, a specter haunting the world, a testament to the darkness that can consume a nation.\n\nThe sign sagged, a burden on Page's shoulders.  A truth too heavy to bear, a truth that refused to be silenced. Burma. A land where history repeats, a land where hope flickers like a dying ember in the wind.",
            "Duke Ellington's shadow stretches long across the jazz landscape. It’s a shadow cast by longevity, by the hand of a man who could mold his orchestra, coax brilliance from its members. Though his own touch on the piano sometimes fades into the background of his compositions, his voice as a composer rings clear. He wove intricate tapestries of sound, rich and complex, that gave every man in his band the space to sing. He built frameworks where solos could breathe, wrote phrases that snagged on the ear, and drew out the particular fire in each player.  He shaped the tone of the whole, birthing sounds that were both coherent and wild, unique to each piece. This mastery of individual voice, and the way those voices bled into a collective whole, brought forth some of the most striking, the most enduring music jazz has ever known. \n\nThe Grove, in its dusty tome, speaks of Ellington's sound, his innovation. It cites \"Creole Love Call,\" a song where the voice itself is made an instrument, a thread woven through his whole career.  This, an early example, shows how he used the voice for texture, for color, unbound by the chains of words. \"Creole Love Call\" also whispers of his skill in letting the soloists bloom. It’s a slow, deliberate blues, twelve bars long, six choruses unfolding like a sigh.\n\nThe first chorus, a call and response, voice and reeds, starts smooth, melodic, then roughens, a growl rising in the throat. The second, a muted trumpet solo, a winding path through the melody, blue notes stretching like shadows. The third, a clarinet like a bird soaring, high and sweet, backed by a piano that whispers in a syncopated dance. The fourth, the whole band echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds answering, a conversation in sound. The fifth, the climax, reeds calling, voices high and urgent, brass and rhythm holding back, a stop-time beat like a held breath. The sixth, back to the first, voice and reeds, but now the voice takes on that growl, a solo instrument in its own right. And then, a brief tag, a vocal run, a trombone with a dissonant sigh, a final whisper.\n\nThis use of voice, this coloring of sound, it’s a thread running through his work. \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, shows him weaving tight orchestration with an ear for tone. A call and response, \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet talking to Baby Cox's scat, the voice a melody, the trumpet a rhythm, a rich tapestry. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" and Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a constant in Ellington's world, introduces the melody on a muted trombone, a sound both mournful and joyous.",
            "The wanting had always been there. A hunger that gnawed. Not for things, not at first. It started in the liminal space between girl and woman, when the world was just beginning to close in.  Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.  Years bled into one another, the wanting sharpening, taking on a new form.  She sought connection, a hand in hers, a gaze that lingered.  But boys, they were like moths drawn to her flame, clumsy and eager, but never quite right. She watched them flit about, these suitors, and wondered at their blindness.  What was it she lacked, this strange emptiness that echoed in her chest? Theories whispered in the back of her mind, shadows skittering across the cavern of her soul, but none offered a satisfying answer.\n\nThe house was usually a place of quiet. Her parents, they moved through the world like ghosts, their voices low murmurs in the stillness. Arguments were rare, a ghost story told only in hushed tones.  The only discord came when she, a whirlwind of energy, clashed against their gentle currents.  She was a storm in a teacup, a bright spark in their quiet lives.\n\nBut today, the air hung heavy. A dissonance crackled in the air. She moved from room to room, searching for solace, when a scream tore through the quiet. Her mother’s voice, sharp and brittle, a broken bird’s song. Panic clawed at her throat. She burst into the kitchen, her heart a drum against her ribs. “Mother? What is it?”\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, a tableau of pain. Her face twisted in agony, her breaths shallow gasps.  “Ow…sweet…get…hospital.”  The words came out in a strangled wheeze. \n\nShe knelt beside her mother, her own hand trembling. “Okay, Mother, tell me where…”\n\nHer mother pointed, a weak gesture, and the daughter knew what she had to do.  The years of lifting weights, of preparing for a battle she never thought she’d have to fight, came flooding back. She lifted her mother, her muscles burning, her heart a lead weight in her chest.\n\nThe hospital reeked of antiseptic and fear. But she barely noticed. All that mattered was her mother, pale and clammy in her arms.  She pushed her way through the throngs of people, her voice a desperate plea.  “Help! My mother!”\n\nDoctors gathered, their faces grim. They whisked her mother away, leaving the daughter standing alone, her hands shaking, her mind a whirlwind of worry.\n\nThe accident was simple, almost mundane. A stepladder, a vase out of reach, a sudden fall.  But in her daughter’s eyes, it was a betrayal, a violation of the fragile peace that had always surrounded them.",
            "This study sought to plumb the depths of a claim: that a way of eating, the Mediterranean Diet, or aMed as it's called, could ward off the slow, creeping cancers of the heart.  It's a life lived closer to the earth, they say, with an abundance of fruits and vegetables, nuts and beans, and the oils of olives. Less meat, less fat, and a measure of wine with meals. \n\nThe old studies hinted at a connection, a whisper of reduced risk in those who embraced this way of life. But this study, it dug deeper. They followed women, strong women in white coats, for two decades, charting their diets and their fates. Thousand upon thousands of these women, their lives laid bare in forms and questionnaires, their meals cataloged with the precision of a surgeon. \n\nThey looked for the toll of heart disease, the sudden darkness of stroke, the slow fade of death itself. The results, stark and undeniable, showed a clear link: those who ate with the sun on their faces, who lived by the rhythm of the seasons, they fared better. Their hearts beat stronger, their strokes were fewer, their lives stretched longer.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, they called it the United States, felt the weight of a coming storm. The air grew thick with the smell of decay, the kind that clings to cities choked by their own ambition. Jobs vanished like smoke in the wind, houses crumbled like rotten teeth, and the giants of industry, the corporations that once seemed invincible, lay broken and bleeding. This sickness, this rot, has lingered. It festers still. A question hangs heavy: how did this come to pass? And how do we stop it from consuming us whole?\n\nThe answer, it whispers in the wind, is a tale of greed and folly, of men in suits who played God with money they didn't understand. They pressed the banks, urged them to lend to those who couldn't pay, to build houses on foundations of sand. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they called these puppets, dancing to the tune of a hollow prosperity. They took these toxic mortgages, repackaged them like poisoned candy, and sold them to anyone who would buy. When the borrowers fell, like dominoes in a child's game, the banks, hollowed out, transferred their plague onto the rest. The contagion spread, infecting the whole body politic.\n\nIt began, they say, back in the Clinton years, when that man, driven by the hunger for power, sought to extend his reign.  He loosened the reins of regulation, fueled the fire of speculation. The New York Times, a thin sheet of paper in the face of the storm, foretold the coming tempest.  They said the government's own hand had planted the seed, and that a reckoning was inevitable.\n\nThe seeds of ruin were sown in the tangled roots of complex mortgages. Adjustable rates, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations – words whispered in hushed tones, carried on the wind like a deadly fog. The housing market, bloated and swollen, became a mirage, shimmering with false promises.  \n\nThen came the crash. The bubble burst, and the giants fell. Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers – their names, once etched in gold, now tarnished and broken. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the survivors, stripped bare and forced to beg for mercy. Fannie and Freddie, crippled by debt, were dragged into the government's embrace.",

Dr. Merlin, she's known to raise her voice at the screen, a bellow that shakes the room, when she finds herself drowning in too much telling. \n\nThe old adage rings true: show, don't tell. But even the seasoned hand can stumble.  Exposition, it's a devil on the shoulder, whispering insidious words. \"Get it all out in the open,\" it urges, \"the history, the backstory, the what-ifs.\"  But the devil of exposition is a greedy beast, demanding a feast of detail, a litany of lives lived, a chronicle of every childhood memory. \n\nIt's the voice droning on, a recitation of facts, a flat narrative devoid of lifeblood. Like a mariner recounting a tale of woe, the words pile up, heavy with significance but light on feeling. \n\nTake the story of a woman, a heroine, let us say. We are told she met her love, a grand wedding, a life together, and then, a cruel twist of fate, his murder before her eyes. Two pages, perhaps, devoted to this narrative skeleton. Dialogue sparse, characters hollow.  \n\nBut what of the man?  The husband?  Show us his love through his words, his gestures, the way his eyes light up when he looks at her. Let us see her transformation, how his presence enriched her world, how his absence leaves a gaping hole in her soul.\n\nGive us the flesh and bone, the essence of their connection.  Only then will we mourn his loss with her, only then will we truly understand the weight of her grief.\n\nThe writer's task is not to merely state the facts, but to paint a picture.  To show us the man, the woman, their love, their loss, in all its raw, unvarnished reality.",

They showed his face, a mask of something dark and cold.  Two minutes they gave it, the story unfolding like a bad dream.  Multiple wounds, they said. Arrested.  Enough time, maybe.\n\nNext, a boy, Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone, shot in the woods. No name for the place, just Sharon Woods. Critically injured. No hand to point at, no answers. The SWAT boys were prowling. A brief moment, this one. Maybe the boy was black, maybe not. I've seen this before, year after year. A white child snatched, lost, hurt, and the world screams. A black boy, a whisper, a shadow.\n\nThen, a hole in the sky. A helicopter, Med-Flight, struck by a .22, a rifle bullet. The air thick with questions. Crime-Stoppers, five thousand dollars, a promise of justice.\n\nThe sky again, this time with rain and thunder promised. Mid-eighties, they said, the heat holding on. A tease, a whisper of the storm to come.\n\nA robbery, a UDF on Clime Road. A black man, they said, dark-skinned, a hoodie pulled low. Six feet tall, a hundred and fifty pounds. They lingered on the blackness, a stain on the news.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a name from Texas. Drug kingpin, they said, marijuana flowing like water from south to north.  Twenty-five years, or \"300 months,\" they said, the numbers cold and hard. A Hispanic man, they added, as if it mattered.",

To understand the heart of brotherhood is to understand the cost.  To look into a brother's eyes and see not reflection but essence, not the mask but the man. In their deeds and their consequences, their character is laid bare. \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk this path. Through a landscape thick with heat and moss, they make a journey without promise.  Disappointment, bitter as gall, clashes with a pride too fierce to name. One brother survives. The other… not so much.\n\nThe story unfolds through the voice of the elder, his words telling a tale of love twisted and tangled. The younger brother, Doodle, is a frail thing, his spirit fragile as a hummingbird's wing. The narrator's voice, steeped in the weight of his memories, reveals the depths of his own torment, the world as he saw it, shadowed by guilt and the burden of his own making.\n\nPride, that burning ember, fuels the narrator's soul.

But there’s a higher order at play, a shaping force that pulls the pieces into place. Top-down, they say. The mind knows what it’s looking at before the eyes have truly seen. A box against white. A hole in the light.\n\nAnd within this vast cathedral of thought, there’s a gatekeeper. A filter that sifts the torrent of information, letting through what’s important, silencing the rest. The blades of grass, the murmur of voices, the name whispered in the wind. The mind attends, it filters, it remembers.\n\nMemory, a flickering candle in the dark. Flickers of sensation, sounds, faces, words. Stored in the very fabric of the being, woven into the sinews and the bone.\n\nAnd what of the knowledge itself? A network of threads, they say, connecting ideas like vines in a forest. Concepts linked by association, by blood and bone. A web spun from the substance of experience.\n\nBut the mind, it’s more than a map. It’s a mapmaker. It’s a storm. It’s a song. It’s the echo of a world unseen.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of manufactured happiness. Huxley, he saw it coming, the shadow of the machine creeping ever closer. Technology and the gilded cage of capitalism, they were the twin vipers coiled around the world's throat. In *Brave New World*, he laid bare the bones of their design, a dystopia where community was a cage and instant gratification the only law.  They were pawns, these people, moved by unseen hands, their thoughts as predictable as the gears in a clockwork heart. The World Controller, a puppet master in a sterile white coat, held the strings.\n\nMarx's ghost whispered in the margins, his words a chilling echo in the sterile halls of the World State. Homogeneity, reification, these were the tools of the system, the shackles forged in the fires of an economy built on want. Huxley saw it all, the false consciousness that blinded the masses, the proletariat kept docile by the sugar-coated pill of consumerism.  They were told they were happy, they believed it. The Deltas, the Gammas, they knew nothing else. The drive to consume, to spend, this was their religion, their salvation. A whispered truth, hidden beneath the veneer of manufactured bliss.\n\nHegemony. The ruling class, the Alphas and Betas, they knew the truth. They saw the strings, but they held them, too. A silent pact, a bargain for their own comfort.  The world spun on, driven by the endless churn of the machine.\n\nAnd in this world, love was a ghost, a forgotten memory.  Faces blurred, characters hollowed out, stripped of the richness of human experience.  Even in the touch of flesh, there was only the coldness of metal, the emptiness of a machine. Technology and capitalism, they had devoured the soul.",
            "The sun bled low in the west over the sprawling stone and brick of the campus. Two and a half years,  four and a half semesters. That was the measure of my time here, in this place that seemed to stretch on forever. Getting around, a thing many of us, myself included, wrestled with like a wild beast. Freshman year I was caged in an East Halls room, the farthest point east barring the stadium and that hulking Jordan Center. Getting to Willard, a place as far removed as the moon, could steal twenty minutes, maybe more, on foot. Especially when the sky wept its grey tears, which it often did in this town. A fellow, not much older than myself, an alumnus, spoke of a time when those East Halls stood alone, surrounded by fields of nothing, a waste of space. Now, those fields were swallowed by concrete, by stadiums and new buildings, a sprawling concrete sea. The Creamery, a new health center. Apartments crawled across the land. The campus, a burgeoning beast, consumed all in its path, and with each bite, the journey from one place to the next became a longer, harder trek.\n\nThe solution, I knew, lay in two wheels. The bicycle. But the bike itself was not enough. It needed riders. And the land itself needed to be molded to their need.\n\nI was talking to a friend, a man who had returned to the saddle after years away. He spoke of the ease of it all, the simple joy. “Why ever I stopped,” he said, his voice tinged with wonder, “bikes are the only way.”  A simple truth. A bowl of oats, a bit of sweat, and you could cover miles. I live off campus now, the distance from the heart of the campus as much as any dorm. The best decision I’d made this year, buying a bike. Thomas building, my daily destination, a twenty-five minute walk. On two wheels, it was five, if I pushed hard. The road, Pollock, was the quickest route, but it was a treacherous path.  Walking, there was a certain virtue to it. But time, a precious commodity, was not on my side. Without the bike, walking would be my only tether to the heart of campus. Two and a half hours a week, lost to the walk to Thomas alone. And that was before the other journeys, the appointments, the endless errands. Time, a thief. I couldn't afford to lose it."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

Where the wounds are deep and the shadows long. Where the broken families and the abused children gather. These are the things that call to me.\n\nService, respect, ethics. These are not just words on a page, they're the stones that build the foundation of a life worth living. They're the light in the darkness. And they're the tools I'll use to mend what's been torn apart.\n\nI've always felt it, this pull towards helping. A need to reach out, to offer a hand to those lost in the wilderness. I saw it in the faces of my classmates, the ones who ran from their own demons, the ones who choked down their pain with substances that offered only a fleeting peace.\n\nA degree in psychology, that was the path I chose. A path that led me to a crossroads. A summer day, a friend's couch, a silhouetted boy, sixteen years old and trembling. He was running from his own hell, from the hands that should have protected him. I saw the fear in his eyes, the desperate plea for help.\n\nI went to his house, to the place where the shadows gathered. I spoke to the police, a voice of reason in the face of indifference. I spoke to the parents, their words a flimsy shield against the truth. They were masters of denial, of twisting reality to fit their own broken narratives.\n\nThat day, I knew.

            "The paper turns its gaze upon the twin specters of sleeplessness: the Biological and the Sociocultural. The first, a matter of genes and the body's frail machinery, whispers of inherited predispositions and the hardwiring of ailment. The second, a phantom born of circumstance, examines the world's grip on the slumbering mind. It probes the loam of race, ethnicity, and the stony weight of circumstance, seeking the roots of unrest. This review delves into these models, laying bare the research that seeks to illuminate their dark corners. For each study, we'll dissect the findings, weighing their strengths against their frailties, seeking the truth that flickers in the shadows. \n\nSleep itself, a fragile thing, can be a prisoner to many masters. It can be a primary affliction, a ghost haunting the mind, or a shadow cast by some deeper malady. The primary sleep disorders, the Dyssomnias, are a bleak procession: Insomnia, where sleep eludes, Hypersomnia, where wakefulness is a burden, Narcolepsy, a cruel parody of rest, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders, where the breath itself betrays, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, a life out of sync with the sun, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified, a category for the nameless terrors. Then there are the Parasomnias, where the body betrays the mind in its dreams, manifesting as Nightmares, Sleep Terrors, and Sleepwalking. And finally, sleep can be a casualty in the wars fought on the battlefields of the mind, a symptom of the deep-seated wounds of Clinical or Personality Disorders.  \n\nThis review, however, focuses its light on insomnia, a plague that touches many lives, and the twin models that seek to understand its grip. The Biological model, a cold and clinical lens, zeroes in on the genes, the inherited predispositions, and the physiological mechanisms that govern sleep. It points to the neurons in the hypothalamus, their orexin-filled chambers the gatekeepers of slumber and wakefulness. A study, conducted in the silent world of mice, revealed that these neurons possess GABAB receptors, sensitive to the touch of certain chemicals. When these receptors are activated, sleep descends. But if they are silenced, anxiety melts away, and sleep's embrace becomes more inviting. This study, using the humble mouse as a stand-in for man, suggests that there is a genetic, and perhaps environmental, basis for these receptors. A flaw in their design, a glitch in the system, could leave a person adrift in a sea of sleepless nights, forever yearning for the solace of rest. The Sociocultural model, peering through a different lens, suggests that these inherited vulnerabilities are shaped by the world around us. If a predisposition to sleeplessness is passed down through generations, it could become a chain that binds, a legacy of unrest. This could manifest in the struggles of daily life, in the shadows cast by school, work, and the unending cycle of mundane tasks.",

The brain, it misfires,  unable to sift the wheat from the chaff, the signal from the noise.\n\nThe whispers started in the mid-century, calling it “auditory imperception.”  Italian hands, Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari, first reached out to measure the silence in these children’s minds. Then Kimura, a ghost in the machine, wove the web of dichotic testing, seeking the phantom thread that bound sound to meaning.\n\nThe signs, they wear many faces. A child lost in a roomful of voices, unable to pinpoint the source. Sounds bleed into one another, indistinguishable, like water merging with the sky. Patterns, they elude them, slipping through their grasp like smoke. They hear a word, but its meaning, it hangs in the air, a distant echo.\n\nTo diagnose, to pierce the veil, they watch, they listen. Tests, they offer,  a barrage of sounds, a symphony of chaos. A child sifts through the noise, searching for the thread that binds, for the meaning that eludes. But there is no single key, no map to navigate  this labyrinthine mind. And the cause, it remains a shadow, a mystery whispered in the silence.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, strikes a bleak note on the nature of disguise.  It shows how a mask can be useful in weaving a web of deceit,  how it can shield and protect. But there's a price. To shed the mask, to face the truth, is to risk unraveling oneself. The world beyond the disguise can be unforgiving.  \n\nTo reveal the lie is to invite judgment, to cast oneself adrift in a sea of misunderstanding. Some may turn away, their faces etched with scorn. Others may harbor resentment, their words like shards of glass.  It is a choice then, a stark one: the preservation of the self, or the bonds of those around.\n\nThe play grapples with this most keenly when the disguise takes on the weight of gender. Why would someone renounce their own identity, assume the mantle of the other? In Viola's case, it is a desperate act of survival. To be a woman in a harsh world is to be vulnerable. She adopts the guise of Cesario, a protector, a shield against the darkness.\n\nYet, this act of self-preservation creates a gulf between her and the women she once knew. She is cut off from their solace, their shared understanding.  And the deception deepens. Olivia, drawn to the illusion of Cesario, mistakes her for Sebastian, her heart entangled in a web of misdirection.  And Orsino, her affections tangled with the fabricated persona, yearns for a love that cannot be.\n\nIs this a modern lens we see through, or is there something deeper at play? Perhaps the play hints at suppressed desires, emotions lurking beneath the surface, brought to light by the artifice of Viola's disguise.  Does Olivia's attraction to Cesario stem from a deeper truth, a secret longing? Or is it a reflection of the shallowness of the world around her, a world that judges by appearances alone?\n\nWhen the mask falls, and the truth is revealed, Olivia's affections shift with the ease of a summer breeze, from Cesario to Sebastian.  She embraces Viola as sister, the deception forgiven, the bonds of blood taking precedence.",
            "The German hand, they say, was heavy on the land. Not for nothing did the whisper of genocide hang over the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. But an empire, vast and sprawling, can't be measured by such simple reckonings. The German dominion was a patchwork, its policies and ways as varied as the landscapes it claimed. And so it was with education. Some lands, like East Africa, saw the Kaiser's hand in schools and literacy, a bloom of knowledge under the watchful eye of the state. Others, well, others were left to the tending of missionaries, their faith a meager harvest in the arid plains.\n\nSouth West Africa was one such land. Not the grand schools of Tanganyika, where the natives were groomed under the watchful gaze of the crown. Here, the task fell to men of God, their offerings sparse, their reach limited. The Kaiser, however, saw to the education of his own, a system of state schools erected, a careful hand guiding the missionaries. The long shadow of this division stretched far into the future, even after the German eagle had flown. While other lands boasted men of letters, South West Africa remained largely untouched, the vast majority unlettered, unschooled, their destinies bound to the unforgiving earth.\n\nThis land, this South West Africa, was a study in contrasts. It asks the question: what forces shaped this divergence? What lay in the hearts of those who claimed ownership, those who sought to mold the destinies of others? This paper seeks to explore those answers, to plumb the depths of history and uncover the truths hidden beneath the sands of time.\n\nThe tales of German education are many, spun in German tongue and penned by those who lived it. They speak of systems, of structures, of the ways knowledge was dispensed. Later, voices from beyond the German borders echoed these stories, comparing and contrasting, dissecting the tapestry of colonial education.  Among these voices, Cohen's stands out, a beacon in the darkness. He peered into the heart of South West Africa and East Africa, seeking the reasons behind their differing trajectories. The answer, he found, lay in the settlers, their numbers, their desires.\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to other colonies, held a temperate embrace, though the desert stretched across much of its face. It was a land that drew the European to its shores. By 1913, nearly fifteen thousand whites had found a home there, a far cry from the five thousand in East Africa, the next most populated colony.",
            "The music called Popular, a hundred years spilled across the land,  has come to wear a thousand faces.  Rock and rap, country and jazz, folk and a hundred whispers in between. Each a tangled knot of branches, bearing sub-genres and sub-sub-genres like fruit heavy on the bough. \n\nHeavy metal, born in the furnace of the last forty years, sings a song of darkness. Its voice, a cacophony of noise and feeling, leans into the shadows. It is a music of excess, a hunger for more, more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality.  It erupted from the earth, a fist clenched tight, demanding to be heard. \n\nEarly on, men and women found the metal sound could bend, could be shaped to their will. Each carved a niche, a sub-genre, a voice within the roar. The branches spread, a tangled forest of sound.\n\nToday, the metal movement stands vast and complex.  Its roots lie buried deep, but its branches reach for the sky. To understand the metal of today, one must first know the metal of yesterday, the fire that birthed it.\n\nMetal, in its essence, is a song of darkness. It is a music of the primal, the visceral, the raw. It is a music born of excess, of drugs and despair, of a hunger that cannot be satiated. The psychedelic haze of the seventies stirred the soul, birthing music that was both beautiful and terrifying. \n\nIt is a music that reminds us of the darkness within, the shadows that lurk at the edge of our vision. It is a music that does not shy away from the bleak realities of life, but embraces them, holds them up to the light. \n\nLyrics like those from \"Helter Skelter\" whisper of this darkness. The Beatles, those purveyors of sunshine and love, delved into the abyss, revealing the darkness that festered beneath the surface. A response to the Rolling Stones, a challenge to prove their own capacity for darkness. The metal seed was sown.",
            "The Surrealists came after him, painting their fractured visions. But Henri Rousseau, long before, was crafting dreams, both of the canvas and the heart.  His *The Dream*, painted in the year nineteen ten, it’s more than a woman at wonder in some painted landscape. It’s Rousseau himself, wrestling with those dreams, the yearnings he held, the hunger for acceptance that gnawed at him. Recognition.  Praise. The love of those who held the keys to the art world, that gilded cage he yearned to enter.  He dreamed it, this prize, and the cost. To conform, to mimic the strokes and styles of the masters, to bend his own vision to fit the mold. Or to stand alone, a singular voice in the clamor, a path carved by his own hand.\n\nThis *Dream*, it’s the echo of that struggle. To understand it, you must know the man. Born in Laval, France, in the year of our Lord eighteen forty-four. His father, a man of commerce, a tinsmith, a dealer. Rousseau, he knew none of that world. No formal schooling in the arts, just the tollbooth, the gabelou’s uniform, the steady rhythm of the coin-counting.\n\nThen, the grief came. A wife lost, eight children swallowed by the earth. A daughter, Julia, his only sun. He turned to painting, a refuge, a canvas to wash away the pain. Unlike the sentimentalists who romanticized the peasant, Rousseau, he was one of them.  He painted the world he knew, the dreams of the common man.\n\nHis hunger for acceptance was a raw thing. Uneducated, he arrived late to the game, surrounded by titans, men whose names were already whispered in galleries. Matisse, a name that would soon be etched in gold. While Matisse feared banality, Rousseau craved the conventional, the safe harbor of the accepted.\n\nHe wanted to be one of them, to be welcomed into the fold. To be more than just a douanier, more than a man who painted dreams. He wanted to be seen, to be heard, to be called an artist.",
            "Many a scholar, many a soul has pondered the kinship, the blood tie, between the things of right and the things of beauty. Truth and grace, hand in hand. Like Keats whispered in his ode,  \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”  We learn much from books and experience, but these truths, these ethics and aesthetics, they seem to seep in without schooling. Like rumors in the wind, or the scent of blood on the breeze. They are descriptions, not commandments. We study beauty and morality not to build cages, but to understand the wild things within. \n\nWe talk of a masterpiece's worth, dissecting it like a frog on a tabletop, foreground, background, context, all laid bare. But does knowing these things tell you why it sings? Why it haunts you? When someone speaks of a favorite song, a favorite story, you hear it: \"There’s just something about it.\"  Something that sits beyond the bone, beyond the words. \n\nLike Flannery O'Connor said, a story is a way to say what can't be said plain. A statement falls short.  No matter how we paint the picture, there's a ghost in the room, a whisper in the dark.  Ethics too, has this ghost. Wittgenstein saw it: \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" \n\nThis \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, this is what makes art and morality sing. This is the bridge between them. We feel them, deep in the marrow, in a way we can't quite explain, a truth that sings in the blood.  Literature, it’s the purest form. It lives and breathes our values, our hopes and our sins. It’s a mirror held up to the soul.",
            "The land they call Germany now, a place of strength and unity, a tapestry woven from the high peaks of München down to the brine-kissed shores of Kiel. The thread runs through Köln, a city carved from the Rhine's embrace, and on to Dresden, a stone sentinel on the Elbe. A culture distinct, born of many sources, many tribes.\n\nGermania. The name itself hangs heavy with shadows, a whisper of origins lost to the wind. Scholars and men of history argue its birth, each with a theory to offer. Tacitus, the chronicler, claimed it from a tribe known as the Tungrians, who crossed the Rhine, their swords stained crimson from Gaulish blood (Tacitus, 98).  Caesar, conqueror of Gaul, first penned the word \"Germanus\" in his grim chronicles of war, a marker to distinguish those he had subdued from those who still held their freedom. He took it from the Gauls themselves, a word to mark the untamed. In his first book, Caesar writes, \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others whisper of a spear, the \"ger,\" a weapon of war, or of a Gaelic cry, \"garim,\" meaning to shout, a testament to the Germans' fierce voices. \n\nTacitus, in his tome \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" penned in the year 98, spoke of a people untouched, unmixed. \"I should regard them as aboriginal,\" he wrote, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" He saw it as a land of harsh beauty, a place where men would not willingly choose to settle unless it was their birthright. \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98). \n\nRome, with its vast empire, saw Germania as a source of wealth, a place to raid and exploit. They sent their legions, driven by the hunger for gold and glory, but ultimately, they returned to the heart of their domain. The Germanic tribes, they remained, living on the edges of the empire, trading their wares, their skills honed in the crucible of war, serving in the ranks of the Roman legions (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "The world below, a tableau of dull brown. I looked down, the scene etched in my mind with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel. Thoughts, like moths, flitted in and out, never settling, never taking root. The mind, a clear and cold pool of observation.\n\nAn artist once told me 'draw on the right side of the brain.' He gave me a book, bound in yellowed paper, its title promising secrets - The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I, a boy of six, dreamt of drawing. Now, the book lay open, its diagrams a map to a world I could not yet navigate. It spoke of frames, of simplifying the chaos into manageable forms. A bowl of fruit, say, reduced to a simple plane.\n\nBut the bowl before me, it held no simple plane. It was a vastness, a chasm of brown.  Picasso in his blue phase, Monet with his greens, the Renaissance masters with their riot of colors - they all had their hues. My hue was brown. This, the beginnings. This, the story. Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand, a tool of creation, trembled. Muscles tensed, uncoiled, seeking form. The water, a mirror, reflecting my intent. A swirl, a shudder, a flake breaking away, drifting into the void. Muscles tightened, a spasm, a jolt. The handle of the toilet. A desperate, clawing motion. The brown refuse, glued to the porcelain, mocking me.\n\nMop in hand, tie choking my throat, I stared. A message, a testament to human waste, left for the cleaners. More flushes, more silence. A hand reached for the wall, the paper trailing like a shroud. A cocoon, a shield.\n\nStanding, bending, dipping my hand into the bowl, a mother into a fiery oven.",
            "The young are dying behind the wheel. A confluence of factors, a dark vector of statistics, points to this grim reality. The learned men at the Institutes say the teen brain, it ain't built for the road. Inexperience, raw and untempered, sits at the heart of it. More than just crashes, it breeds rollovers, speed, and a hunger to run off the blacktop.\n\nAnd they drive with their kind.  A fact as plain as the sun. The folks down in California, they did some lookin' and found a truth as hard as gravel: the younger the passenger, the higher the chance of a wreck.\n\nStates, they've tried to stanch the flow. Provisional licenses, curfews, limits on young company. But these are just patches on a hole in the soul. The young, they're not ready. By all measure, they ain't fit for the weight of the wheel. Even eighteen, a man named Zuckerman says, is too young. He's seen it, studied it.  These young ones, they crave the rush, the edge of the blade.  It's in their blood.\n\nSo what's the answer? Delay. Wait till the hunger for the thrill fades, till the recklessness abates. We keep givin' them keys, we'll be drownin' in their blood. The Boomers' young'uns, they're comin' of age. Millions of them, ready to take the wheel.\n\nThe fix ain't hard.  Schools can teach, but no child under eighteen, no sir, should be allowed to drive.  A permit, a trial run, maybe, but not the full license. Hours behind the wheel, supervised, logged.  California, they do it right.\n\nIt's a simple matter, really. A national standard, a law clear as day. Protect the young, protect us all. Why, it ain't rocket science.",
            "The Library of Congress held a trove of Edison’s early films, flickering ghosts of a vanished age. Fifteen trick films, they called them.  From the year 1895 to 1901, these phantoms played upon the screen, their illusions spun from the threads of edited moments. I watched them, these ghosts of the nascent cinema, their poetics unraveling before me.  Most were bound by the stage, confined within the frame of a proscenium, the camera a silent sentinel, immobile. Long shots, medium shots, these were their domain. Close-ups, the intimacy of a whispered secret, were absent, a world too vast for such scrutiny. One shot, one film, the rule seemed to be. Each a vignette, a fleeting moment captured in time. A minute or less, a blink in eternity.\n\nBut there were whispers of rebellion, flickers of change. Some dared to break the mold, to introduce the audacity of multiple shots, stitching together moments to weave a more complex tapestry. The stage remained, the proscenium arch a constant, a boundary that confined the figures within.  They moved side to side, like puppets on a string, never venturing towards or from the lens.  Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, a film from the year 1900, a good example.  They entered from the right, their forms swallowed by the darkness, then reappeared, moving back and forth, bound to the stage's confines. The camera, a watchful eye, never followed.\n\nThe trick films were echoes of the theatre, of vaudeville’s magic and illusion. The audience, like spectators in a grand hall, saw the whole, framed by the proscenium's embrace.  A single “shot” could be a symphony of moments, joined invisibly to create the illusion of apparition, of disappearing acts. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, one of the earliest of these phantoms. The severed “head” appears in a moment, a single shot, but a closer inspection reveals the stitching, the joining of moments, the illusion carefully constructed.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the soil, was a firebrand for Republicanism. Though his life was bound to the rhythm of the fields, that same life, brief as it was in the halls of power, forged a man known for his unwavering convictions. Freedom was the seed he tended, both in the realm of man and in the machinations of government. His faith in the agrarian way was the bedrock of his convictions, shaping his pronouncements on sovereignty, on the very nature of the Constitution, on the scales of justice.\n\nHe saw in the new nation a chance to build something true, unburdened by the ghosts of ancient customs.  The ground was fertile, unmarred, ready to bear the fruit of self-government.  He held fast to the natural rights of man, a creed as immutable as the laws of nature itself. He saw them as a chain, indivisible, fragile.  If one link was broken, the whole would fray and weaken. These rights, he argued, must be kept beyond the reach of man's own designs, for they were the very essence of his being. He scoffed at the notion of a \"state of nature,\" where the strong preyed on the weak, where cunning was a shield against the brute force of the world.  Civilization, he believed, demanded a higher order.\n\nTo build this ideal, Taylor envisioned a government that understood the duality of human nature.  Good and evil resided within each man, a constant struggle.  He held fast to this duality, a rigid moral compass guiding his every thought.  Government, he argued, could not escape the imperfections of its creators.  \"As government is exercised by man,\" he wrote, \"all its virtues and vices must be human.\"  He saw good principles in the protection of private property, in the nurturing of the land, in the curbing of unchecked ambition.  A government founded on these principles, he believed, would function justly, despite the inevitable flaws of its administrators, for they would be swayed by the twin demons of avarice and self-interest.\n\nSelf-interest, he argued, was the engine that drove men, but it was only when it festered, when it bent the human heart towards the destruction of the common good, that it became a scourge.  A good government, he believed, was necessary to contain this inherent darkness, to act as a watchful sentinel against the creeping corruption of power.\n\nLike many of his Republican brethren, Taylor was a champion of strict construction.  He envisioned a Federal government limited in scope, its powers confined to the explicit pronouncements of the Constitution.  He saw an expansive government as a breeding ground for tyranny, a bottomless pit of expense and corruption.  Yet, he warned against a rigid, literal interpretation, for it could be a path to ruin.  He sought a deeper understanding, a grasp of the intent of the framers, a respect for the spirit behind the words.  And he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the nation, a testament to the sovereignty of the states, a beacon of liberty in a world yearning for freedom.",
            "The graph, Figure 17, showed a sudden drop in the commuter logs come the third month. A dispiriting sight. The reasons, hard to say. Winter had settled on the New England campus, a chill in the air that kept folks off bikes and out of the cold. December, the semester's end, found everyone consumed: papers due, grades looming. The log, a forgotten thing. And then came the holidays, a month-long break, campus emptied, no need to tread the paths. Classes resumed in late January, yet the logs remained scarce. \n\nThe drop in February, that was a mystery. Projects, they run hot at first, then cool. A natural thing. So we tried to stoke the fire. Carpool Challenge Week in March, a blitz of prizes and pleas. It worked. The logs climbed. \n\nBut the lesson was clear: keeping a project alive, that's a fight. The ebb and flow of semester breaks, the slow creep of indifference, these are enemies to be reckoned with.\n\nAnother foe: the car. A freedom, a comfort, woven into the fabric of this country. To win folks away, you need more than good intentions.  \n\nWe offered prizes, gift certificates to cafes, shops, a massage here and there. Maybe something bigger would have helped - a bike, a hybrid car, even an electric one.  The prizes, they stayed the same. But what if they had grown? A bike announced in December, a hybrid in January. Maybe then, the logs wouldn't have dwindled.",
            "The Exchange Traded Fund. A thing of metal and paper, a security they say, designed to mimic the dance of the market. A basket of holdings, an index, a commodity, all bound together and traded like the single stock it ain’t.  It offers the broad stroke of the index fund, they say, but with the tools of the individual - shorting, margin, all the tricks of the trade at your fingertips, all for a fraction of the cost.  \n\nBut there’s a price, always a price.  Each trade, a commission paid, like a toll on the road to riches. And even with these supposed benefits, the question hangs heavy: does the diversification truly exist?

These ten, they account for a good portion of the whole, 63.58% they claim. We’ll see if they truly represent the creature, if they can stand on their own, if they offer a path to profit that surpasses the sum of its parts.\n\nWe’ll measure their return, their beta, these metrics of risk and reward.

            "The land of dreams, so Poe called it.  One of his better poems, he claimed. In \"Dream-Land,\" he casts a word, \"Thulé,\" into the verses, a word traced back by Mabbott to the lips of Virgil. Virgil, speaking of an island north of Britain, a place the Greeks held as the edge of knowing.  Virgil used it, that's certain. But there's a newer source, one to which credit must be given. Poe, he was drawn to the words of the Germans. \n\nThis reference, it speaks to Poe's familiarity with Goethe's own dark musings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" he draws a line between their words, suggests Poe was mimicking the master. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature, it tells us of Goethe, celebrated writer of the tragic drama \"Faust,\" a work split into two parts, the first in 1808, the second with the author's own passing in 1832. Within the second part, a short poem, \"The King of Thulé.\" A king grieving his wife, who offered him a goblet as a gift, now drinks deeply and weeps. He decides his time has come and gives his possessions to his children, save for the goblet.  He walks to a precipice, casts the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and falls. The King of Thulé, his demeanor, his very being, mirrored in the shadowy figure of Poe's \"Dream-Land.\"  A dark reflection, perhaps, of Poe's own loss and his solace in drink.\n\nFaust, it also found its way onto the stage, woven into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, less than a year before Poe himself used the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nTwice Poe summons \"Thulé\" in his own writings. Once he speaks of \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land\" it sits, bookends to the poem.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land,\" they stand as companions, their verses echoing one another. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker walks into that bleak landscape, haunted by the ghosts of friends departed. He sees a world drained of color, a world of shadows.  These are the echoes of \"The King of Thulé,\" a man consumed by grief, a king lost in the darkness following his wife's death. The entire poem, it reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's own lament.\n\nGoethe, a giant in literature, a figure Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his admiration for Tennyson.   Poe once said, when asked of Tennyson, “I have read his poetry with the utmost interest….”\n\nAnd beyond that connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's works in the many reproductions that were blossoming in those years.",
            "The law in this sun-bleached state says a man might find redress, might find justice, if he were to fall, a victim to the slick treachery of spilled applesauce. The question then becomes, could this man, this Palmer,  win more than just the coin for his hurt? Could he wrest from the pockets of the store, the D&D, a sum meant as punishment? \n\nA judge, he might not be quick to dismiss this claim. Palmer must show the manager, Martin, acted not merely carelessly, but with a deliberate indifference, a cold heart. The law speaks of \"willful and conscious disregard\" -  a man who knows the danger and chooses to ignore it. And \"despicable\" too, it must be, this conduct.\n\nPalmer will say Martin knew the danger. Six times before, men and women had stumbled, fallen, victim to the same treacherous slickness.  Six times, and still Martin, he lingered over his dinner, ignoring the pleas of his own men. \n\nOn that day, the thirteenth of October, the air heavy with the scent of apples and something else, something darker,  Wayne told Martin of the spill. Martin, he mumbled about his dinner, about the complaints of men, as if they were bothersome flies. Haddigan, another, she too brought word of the danger. Same answer, same disinterest. And then, at half past five, Palmer, she slipped.  A broken back. A shattered life.\n\nThe law in this land, it speaks of malice, of oppression, of a disregard for the safety of others. A cold disregard, a willful one.  Will the court find it here? Will they see the malice in Martin's indifference?",
            "Four years gone. A semester at CBC, dust swirling in the air like desert sand. Islam. The word hung heavy in the classroom, a question mark echoing in the faces of the young. Was it a religion of peace or a fist raised in the name of God? A question that gnawed then, even more so now. \n\nThe world spun its kaleidoscope. After the smoke cleared, the media shifted, a pendulum swinging from suspicion to an acceptance bordering on worship. Could a man like Obama, a name whispered with both reverence and fear, a name touched by the shadow of Islam, have ever risen to the highest office? Unthinkable in the before-time.\n\nThe Prophet's story, a tapestry woven with threads of history and faith, intrigued me. I'd heard tales of a warrior, a conqueror who carved a path with the edge of his sword, forcing men to kneel before Allah. But this biography painted a different picture, a martyr misunderstood, a man who humbled himself before the gaze of the world.  And slowly, like moths drawn to a flickering flame, they came, drawn to the light of his words.\n\nThe echoes of Jesus resonated in the miracle tales, the loaves and fishes multiplied, the water turned to wine. But here, the shepherd offered mutton and milk, a simple feast for forty men. A subtle shift, a whisper of an alternative.  Did they seek to elevate him, to paint him as a prophet who needed no proof, only the quiet hum of truth? A silent theft, a shadow play cast upon the life of Christ.\n\nAnd the stories, whispered from man to man, each a layer of gauze obscuring the truth.  A chain of witnesses, each link a fading memory. Did this lend credence or cast doubt?  Was this the mark of truth, or the echo of a carefully crafted narrative?\n\nThe most unsettling thing, the thing that gnawed at the edges of my mind, was the attempt to elevate Muhammad. To paint him as a gentle shepherd, a sage, a man of peace. A man who, history whispered, was forged in the fire of conquest. Could those who followed him truly know the truth, the man behind the myth?",
            "The man called Jesus. His words. His way.  Left behind, they were, in the dust of his passing.  Christianity, a thing of slow, inexorable change, drifted from its moorings.  The world, it writhes and twists, ever forward, ever changing.  The old ways cling, stubborn as weeds, but their hold weakens.  A yearning will bloom, a hunger in the hearts of men. A seeking after the root, the source, the wellspring before the waters ran thick with dogma.  Decades, centuries perhaps, but the tide will turn. Backwards.  Layer by layer, the accretions will fall away, until only the bare bones remain.  The bones of Jesus. The bones of God's word as he spoke it.  A vast movement, a tide of souls returning to the shore.  \n\nThe church, the institution, it will endure.  But the things within, the tangled vines of belief, will be pruned.  Uniformity will rise from the ashes of diversity.  One faith, one voice.  History, it is a river, ever flowing, ever changing course.  Persecution to power, from shackles to leadership, the wheel turns.  Now it turns again, towards the source.  Towards Jesus.   \n\nThe key lies in the words.  Not as stone tablets, immutable and cold, but as whispered truths, echoes of a timeless well.  \n\nBefore Jesus, before the man, there was the seed.  Judaism.  Monotheism, a single God, a single truth.  The scriptures, a wellspring of ancient wisdom.  Divisions within, yes. Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots.  But a unity of core belief.  The foundation.",
            "The muck of man. That's what Sinclair lays bare in *The Jungle*. Greed, a sickness, it consumes them all, these men with their factories and their dreams of empires. They build their towers of brick and steel, spitting smoke into the belly of the sky, heedless of the blight it brings. The river of their industry runs black, poisoned with the waste of their hunger.  They see no man, no beast, only profit. \n\nTheir hands, stained with the sweat and blood of the working man, count only the coins. Loyalty? Decency?  Faded words in the clang and clatter of the gears. Here, a man is a cog, a replaceable part in their machine. Hours bleed into days, days into years. A layoff, a whisper on the wind, and a family left to starve.  No law to shield them, no hand to pull them from the mire.\n\nSinclair paints a picture of a hell on earth, a Packingtown choked by its own ambition. The workers, chained not by iron but by circumstance, are but ghosts in a city of shadows. They toil, they bleed, they die, their cries swallowed by the roar of industry.  He calls them slaves, and the word rings true, for what is man but a slave to his own desires, a slave to the system that grinds him down?",
            "The writer, he crafts worlds with language.  Shapes the reader's heart with the words he chooses. Some paths are truer than others. Fitzgerald, he knew this. In *The Great Gatsby*, he spins a tapestry of meaning, threads of gold and green, white and gray, red and pink. He builds a language of symbol, a whispers of what lies beneath. And the colors, they sing a song of longing and decay.\n\nFitzgerald paints white and gray, not as they are, but as they become.  White, a brittle purity, the sheen of something higher. Gray, the dust of time, the fading of dreams. It hangs in the air from the first page. Daisy, Jordan, they are cloaked in white.  Nick, he wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, a white shirt, a ghost in the throng.  And the only time the white fades, it's in the gaudy hues of Gatsby's hollow revelry.\n\nHe paints the world in shades of meaning. The canyons of the city, white chasms. Names on a timetable, gray, lost in the churn.  Catherine's apartment, a white shard in a city of white.  Even the child of the railroad, a whisper of gray.  And the old man selling dogs, his face weathered, his soul gray. \n\nAnd then he uses it.  He uses white and gray to define Daisy.  After a long silence, she reappears, a shimmer of white. A little white roadster, a ghost in the summer heat.  She is no longer a woman, but a longing, a phantom of Gatsby's desire.  The haze of her fur collar, gray, a veil over her true self.  White again, before the confrontation, a spectral figure in the gathering storm.",
            "The sun beat down on San Diego County, baking the soil and coaxing life from the earth. A land of plenty, they called it. Tomatoes fattened on the vine, citrus trees hung heavy with fruit, and leafy greens unfurled in the gentle breeze. Squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers – the bounty was vast.  And there were those who sought to cultivate it with a touch lighter than the hand of industry.\n\nWord had spread of a different kind of farm, one that eschewed the chemical kiss of progress for the slow, patient rhythm of nature.  Organic, they called it. Community Supported Agriculture, a network of folks willing to pay a premium for a slice of the earth's honest gift. Waiting lists stretched long, a testament to the yearning for something more, something real.\n\nEggs laid by hens roaming free, milk drawn from cows grazing on sun-drenched pastures, these were the staples of a simpler time, a time when man walked more lightly on the land. Farms became sanctuaries, offering more than just sustenance. Trails wound through fields of ripening vegetables, inviting weary souls to escape the city's clamor. Birdsong filled the air, a chorus of life undisturbed by the hum of machinery.\n\nThis, they believed, was the way forward. A way to heal the land, to nourish the body and the soul, and to build a future where man and nature could exist in harmony.\n\nBut the path wasn't easy. Organic farming demanded more, a constant vigilance against pests and weeds, a tireless nurturing of the soil.  The yields were often less, the costs higher. Yet, the reward was more than just a profit. It was the satisfaction of knowing that one was part of something larger, something enduring. \n\nThe land itself held secrets, whispered tales of ancient peoples who had walked these paths before. Cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers had come and gone, leaving their mark on the landscape.  Now, a new chapter was about to begin. A chapter marked by the promise of a future where the earth's bounty could once again be shared with all who sought it.",
            "Culture. A word that hangs heavy, a shroud. A ghost whispering in the halls of men. What it is, what it ain't, a riddle wrapped in a riddle.  Not a single thing, not a uniform fabric. To say all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, that's a lie told by fools. It's the shadows and the silences that matter, the way a culture breathes, the way it bleeds. A stranger comes to a foreign land, and he sees it through the lens of his own experience. Comparisons bloom like weeds.\n\nTo understand another, you gotta dig deep. History, prejudices, the roots that bind them. You can't judge, you can't change. You can only accept. The boundaries are set. Especially at the table, where men trade goods and souls.  A weaker hand, a foreign tongue - respect for the way things are, that's your only shield.\n\nBut culture ain't confined to borders. It lives in the walls of a house, in the steel and glass cages we call companies. Some grind men down, some let them breathe. Dress codes, the way words are strung together, the way tasks are passed from hand to hand - these are the whispers of a company's soul.  Look at America, a land of contradictions, where even within the same city, the air can taste different.\n\nValues. That's the heart of it. Why a man acts, why he flinches, why he bargains hard. To save face, to keep the peace, that's one culture. To strike a blow, to claim victory, that's another. Before you sit across from a man, you gotta know his why.\n\nBut the deepest knowledge comes from the man himself.  A name, a story, a glimpse into the soul. That's what makes the table sing. That's what makes a deal worthwhile.",
            "The fool's words echoed in the mind: there is no God. A whisper from the Psalms, a seed planted by the hand of the ancients. Anselm, that seeker of truth, took those words and twisted them, spun them into a web to catch the Almighty. But Aquinas, the man of reason, he scoffed at such shadows. He sought proof in the dust and the light, in the motion and the stillness.\n\nTwo men, two roads, both converging on the same destination: the face of the Creator. But their journeys were as different as fire and ice. Anselm, he looked inward, into the dark chambers of the soul. He claimed that God resided there, a hidden truth revealed only to those who dared to seek. Faith, he called it, a leap into the void.  \n\nAquinas, he looked outward, at the world laid bare before him. He saw the gears turning, the cause and effect, the echo of design in the chaos. He spoke of logic, of proof. Five arguments, he laid them out, each a stone in a wall built against doubt.\n\nBut do these walls hold? Does faith truly illuminate the darkness, or does it merely create an illusion of light? And can reason, cold and calculating, ever truly grasp the Divine? The answer, like God himself, remains elusive.",
            "The prince born into the world sometime in the dark half-life of the fifth century, before the counting of Christ, would one day be known as Buddha. He cast off the world, seeking solace in the silence. His words, carried on the wind, took root and blossomed into Buddhism, a faith as old as the mountains themselves. Theravada, the oldest branch, still clings to the bones of his teachings, though the flesh has changed. \n\nThis is seen in Sri Lanka, a land where the monks still perform the water-cutting ceremony, a rite as ancient as the island's heart, though Buddha himself spoke nothing of such things. The changes run deep, from the painted faces of the faithful to the very essence of their salvation. Both the cloistered and the lay, bound by the same thread of faith, have had to bend the doctrines to fit the shape of a changing world. \n\nTo understand this we must speak in riddles, for there are forces at play both within and without the fold. Internal forces, born of the heart of the Buddhasasana, monastic or lay, they shape the faith from within. External forces, from those who do not tread the same path, come bearing gifts or shadows. Hostile forces, they seek to wound the heart of the faith, fueled by misunderstanding and malice. Benign forces, they may mean no harm, yet their touch can soothe or scar. \n\nWe speak first of the core, the bedrock of Theravada. Refuge is found in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, the teachings, slumber in the three baskets: the Suttas, the Vinaya, and the Abhidhamma. The Suttas contain the words of the Buddha, the Vinaya the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma, the secrets of the mind, where concepts like Anatta – no self – and Dukkha – the eternal ache of being – find their dwelling. Only by understanding these truths, the impermanence of all things, can one escape the wheel of Sansara, the endless cycle of birth and death.  \n\nWith Sansara, the serpent of desire, lobha, the viper of hatred, dosa, and the fog of delusion, moha, will finally be laid to rest. In the Vinaya, the path is laid out, the rules for living, five for the lay and many more for those who walk the monastic road.  \n\nBut the heart of it all, the pivot on which the world turns, is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha, the truth of suffering. Second, that craving is the root of suffering. Third, that this suffering can be overcome. Fourth, that the path to overcome suffering is the Eightfold Path.",
            "The borderlands between the two republics, America and Mexico, had known a long and bitter feud. Fifty-seven years it stretched, from the year '36 to the turn of the century, a time when rifle smoke and red blood stained the earth. The War, they called it, a war that saw the young and hungry nation carve out its dominion westward, swallowing Texas and the sun-baked lands of the Southwest. It was a war born of clashing creeds, a struggle between the old world and the new, between the ways of the Cross and the ways of the frontier.  \n\nBefore the bells of war tolled, there were skirmishes, raids, whispers of discontent. The men on both sides, fueled by a hunger for land and a thirst for power, found themselves locked in a dance of violence, a macabre waltz that echoed through the canyons and deserts.\n\nThe old grudges, born of the Spanish and English, lingered like a bad smell in the air. A shadow cast by the past, it darkened the path to understanding. The borderlands, a place of both promise and peril, became a stage for this age-old drama.\n\nAnd as the years wore on, the rivalry waned, not with a bang but a whimper. Mexico, bound by necessity, found itself tethered to the American eagle. The hunger for land had been replaced by a hunger for profit, and the shadow of war receded into the dust.",
            "Fifteen years gone. Snatched by an illness, a shadow thing I didn't know existed. I was a nurse then, tending to the sick and weary. A choice made out of need, a yearning for the kind of safety that had eluded me as a child.  \"Always a job, people always ailing,\" they'd say.  A mantra to ease the ache of uncertainty. But the science, the words, that was the pull, a yearning for knowledge. Still, the safe harbor of nursing beckoned.\n\nNow, at forty-six, alone, pockets bare, the sickness had taken hold. Fifteen years on that thin thread of Social Security, and nothing left to call my own.  A day-to-day struggle, a gnawing fear that claws at the edges of security, safety, even self-worth. Nothing certain anymore, yet one thing rings true: I wouldn't have weathered this storm without the hands that pulled me up, the love and solace of family and friends.  A stark reminder, when the world turns dark, how little strength we truly possess.\n\nLife, it throws its punches. Big and small, they come without warning. No wall can hold back the tide. Preparedness is a virtue, yes, but some things are beyond the reach of even the sturdiest shelter.\n\nThe talk of rugged individualism, of self-reliance, it echoes through the halls of power. But the bones of this nation weren't built on isolation. They were forged in the fires of compassion, in the shared burdens and the lifting hands of neighbors. Those pioneers, they crossed the vast plains not by going it alone, but by the strength of their shared purpose.\n\nSo yes, be ready. Stock your shelves, gather your supplies.  Candles, flints, canned goods, water.  A fire in the belly, a fire in the hearth. But while you prepare for the storm, remember the faces around you. The ones who stand beside you, the ones who might need your hand. That, too, is a kind of preparation.",
            "The why of it, the how of it, this shaping of life. What binds it, what bends it? D'Arcy Thompson, back in '17, he said the zoologist barely dreamt of speaking of life in numbers. The words still ring true. But now, they try. They try to mimic the dance of the shell, the slow build of the mollusk, with equations and lines. Raup and Stanley, they took a crack at it, back in '81, with their models of belly-housing. Our work, it follows that path. We look at *Prunum*, the spiral-shelled kind, and ask how the numbers tell the story. We use the ghosts of shells, captured in X-ray, to tease out the measure of their form. We feed these bones of data into CerioShell, Stone's program, and watch the forms shift, grow, change. We want to know what the limits are, the boundaries of possibility. What can a shell become? And how does it become it? This, we try to piece together, with the whispers of the shell and the language of the machine. \n\nA shell, it's a journey through time and space, a tube winding, turning, ever-spiraling. Each turn, a whorl, a whisper of the past, clinging to the imaginary line of the columella, the heart of the spiral. The whorls grow, some faster, some slower, separated by sutures, fine lines marking the passage of time. The last whorl, the body whorl, the one holding the flesh, the one we see first. The rest, the spire, a record of the journey before. The apex, the tip of the spire, the beginning. The base, the end, the mouth of the world. And through it all, the aperture, the opening, the breath of the creature.\n\nWe look at the shell from every angle, apical, basal, apertural, abapertural. The usual way, the shell face tilted towards us, the apex reaching towards the heavens. \n\nCounting the whorls, it's like tracing the steps of a ghost. Start at the apex, the first suture, a line dividing the past from the present. Count the whorls from there, each one a quarter of a story.\n\nThe shell, it's a series of apertures, a path through time and space, each whorl a marker, a place where the creature touched the world. We chart this path, the center of each aperture, the radius, the dimensions of its world. We make it speak in numbers, in equations. And with these numbers, we can change it, twist it, make it new.",
            "The bones of the infant and the child.  In Indonesia they lay still for a decade, these numbers.  The country, it crawls toward the sunlight of those distant goals, the Millennium promises of water and clean earth. But the mothers and the young, their fate hangs by a thread. The road to salvation by 2015 is long and shadowed. \n\nThe reasons for this failing, they whisper in the wind.  A broken system, not a program, demands fixing.  \n\nThey speak of midwives, skilled in the old ways, tending the births of seventy-two percent of the children.  But skill is a hollow word when the storm breaks, when the mother bleeds.  The old ways cannot mend what the modern age can.  And the children, the young ones, they wither from the unseen demons of diarrhea.  Forgotten in the afterbirth, the mothers too, abandoned by the hand of care.  \n\nThe knife, the cold steel of the surgeon's blade, it finds its mark in the cities, seven percent.  But in the fields, where the sun bleeds red, it's a mere two.  A chasm opens between the haves and the have-nots, a wound in the fabric of the land.  The rich, they feast on health, the poor, they starve.  A gulf of twenty-seven percent, a stark reminder of the price of poverty.\n\nNow the question hangs, a shadow in the air:  programs or a system?  The quick fix, the targeted blow, it beckons.  But it's a siren song, luring them to shallow waters.  The money flows, it dries the wells of other fields, leaving only dust and despair.  The body, it is not a collection of parts, but a whole, a singular entity.  The programs, they are splintered shards, failing to see the truth.",
            "The Victorian age. A time of lace and lords, of detail spun fine as cobwebs and manners stiff as starched collars. Yet even in that gilded cage, certain stories took flight, wings clipped but still beating, stories that dared to veer from the gilded path.\n\nTake *Oliver Twist*, for instance, or *Wuthering Heights*. Both whisper of shadows, of things unseen that claw at the edges of reason.  They are novels of mystery,  of the bizarre blooming in the heart of the ordinary. This is what gives them their edge, their bite. The characters, trapped within their own labyrinthine worlds, writhe beneath the surface. Their desires, their fears, they are laid bare, exposed like raw nerves.\n\nDickens, he knew how to burrow into the mind, how to pull out the gristle and sinew of a soul. This passage, a glimpse into Oliver's fractured consciousness:\n\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nHe's adrift, lost in a sea of pain and confusion. The line between reality and nightmare blurs, the shooting, the faces of Sikes and Crackit, all swirling together in a maelstrom of terror. It's a potent image, the boy helpless, a puppet in the hands of fate. This is the heart of the mystery, the question that gnaws at the soul: who is pulling the strings?\n\nThe same thread, this dance with the unseen, runs through *Wuthering Heights*. Dreams bleed into reality, and the past, like a ghost, lingers in the shadows. But here, the mystery is more complex, more rooted in the characters themselves.\n\nThey are creatures of passion, consumed by dark desires, driven by a hunger that can never be satiated.  Theirs is a world of secrets, of forbidden love, and of revenge that echoes through generations.  They are trapped, not just by circumstance, but by their own tormented souls.",
            "Two years gone now. Worked the after-school shift, tutoring the young ones. English and reading, that's where I found my footing.  A boy, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, came to me. Couldn't read a lick. Strange, it was. Some letters, he'd pronounce clear as a bell, others, like they were foreign. He spoke English good as any, but reading, it was a wall. Latino, I reckoned, though the boy spoke no Spanish to my ears. We wrestled with it, day after day, till one afternoon, the boy's mother walked in. Didn't speak a word of English. Just Spanish. Me, barely a whisper of the tongue myself. But then, it hit me. Like a load of bricks. The boy, he could read fine.  He just didn't know the English letters. Never did figure if it helped him much, though I hope he's doing alright.\n\nThat's the thing about language, see. It ain't always plain as day. Even for a boy who speaks it smooth, reading, it can be a birth-giving ache.  California's got a problem, a wall of tongues. What to do about it? Adrian, he needed simple things: English reading, the alphabet, the sounds. But the kids who barely speak it, now that's a different beast. No single answer fits. Dual language, immersion, tutors, ESL. Each one a piece of the puzzle, but not the whole. \n\nDual language, that's a good start. Not just for the Spanish-speakers, mind you, but for all.  Those kids in two-way programs, they outpace their peers.  Folks fear it, say it's a waste, that the majority won't see a dime's worth.  But that's a lie. Make it the rule, not the exception, and everyone benefits. But how?  We ain't gonna make every teacher bilingual, are we? Unreasonable, that is.  But what if we had helpers, tutors, folks who spoke both tongues, to lend a hand?",
            "The world whispers of something vast, something beyond reckoning. A Presence. Some are ushered into pews, others into temples, still others left to grapple with it alone. Faith, a heirloom passed down, accepted or cast aside. Some hold tight to a creed, only to see it crumble in the face of the howling void.  We are adrift, each a lone vessel searching for a beacon in the dark. A compass in the chaos.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" he'd said, thin lips barely moving, eyes fixed on the rain drumming a mournful rhythm on the tin roof.  We sat on the porch, smoke curling from our cigarettes, the air thick with the smell of wet earth and decay. The gutters overflowed, drowning the wilted blooms along the edge of the boards. He stared out at the gray world, a haunted look in his eyes, lost in some half-remembered ache. He'd grown gaunt, his clothes hanging loose on his frame. His hair, once a thick thatch, now sparse, like the brushstrokes of a fading memory. He didn't meet my gaze, and I felt a cold knot in my chest. A fear I couldn't name, a fear of saying the words that would make it real, the words that would seal the bargain. So I sat beside him, drew closer, and watched the rain fall, swallowed by the twilight.\n\nHe went in December, five days after my twenty-second year. The treatments, the poison they pumped into him, had only bought him a few more months. Months of pain. What good was that? I thought, alone in the darkness, no prayers on my tongue. If God existed, he'd long since turned his back.\n\nI wouldn't watch him go. I couldn't bear to see the life that birthed me fade into the void. I would remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than they did. Better than his own kin. He wouldn't have wanted me there, a silent witness to his surrender.  I curled in the bed, a small, shivering thing, waiting for the word.\n\nNo word came.",
            "The Gothic, Watt called it an oxymoron. \"Old-New.\" A contradiction writ large. Praised and damned, dismissed as shallow and hailed for its dreadful grandeur.  Walpole, the first to christen it, saw the Gothic in the clash of the ancient and the modern. He wove it into the fabric of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" a tapestry of theatricality and nature's mimicry, a story born of shadows and moonlight.  \n\n Even then, \"Gothic\" was a word tossed about, a misnomer for a thousand things, past and present, a relic of a time deemed archaic. But in Walpole's hands, the ancient and the new found a strange harmony. The Gothic novel, with its intimate gaze into the soul, a window into the heart of man, it endured.  \n\nChivalry, that fading dream of knighthood, pulsed at the heart of it all. The training, the code, the idealized knight, a beacon in a world perceived as lacking its virtues.  The Gothic, in its yearning for a lost age, romanticized the past, a yearning for a purity that seemed to have vanished. \n\nWalpole, writing amidst the turmoil of his time, saw the decay, the moral rot that threatened to consume the present. He saw it in Frederic, a prince, a survivor of tragedy, a figure cloaked in chivalric ideals, a man who embodied the virtues they had lost. A ghost of nobility in a world grown dark.  \n\nThe description of him, a litany of chivalric tropes, a prince, a victim, a warrior marked by loss. The gallant knight, exaggerated, pushed to the edge of excess, a harbinger of the dark theatricality to come.",
            "The flow.  It starts with the want. The call from the customer, a whisper in the wind.  Then the chase. For the raw stuff, the sinew and bone of the thing. The making. The forging. The sending out. This they call supply chain management. A term coined by a man named Oliver, back in the year 1982.  He spoke of planning, of control, of keeping the gears oiled and turning to satisfy the hunger of the wanting.\n\nSix things hold it together. Production, the heart of it all. Supply, the veins that feed the beast. Inventory, the marrow. Location, the bones. Transportation, the movement. And information, the whisper that guides the hand.\n\nProducers, they stand at the forge. They know what the people crave. They look to the market, a vast and shifting landscape, and read the signs. What will sell? How much? Where will it be born? These are the questions that drive them.\n\nThey choose the ground, the place where metal melts and shapes take form. They build the machines, and train the hands that wield them. Every detail a prayer, every bolt a hope. For if the steps are not taken in order, if the rhythm falters, the whole damn thing can collapse.\n\nTake Wal-Mart, for instance. Or Target. They have plans for everything. A blueprint for every action, every movement. Even the way a man ties his shoes. For in this world, order is everything.\n\nAnd then there's supply. The choice of who will feed the fire. Will it be done in-house, or will the work be cast out, sent to others? The manager weighs the options, seeking velocity. The speed of creation, the agility to adapt, the cost of it all.\n\nFor in the end, it's all about the flow. A river of goods, driven by the needs of men.",
            "The sign hung crooked, a rasping testament to a truth too stark for comfort.  \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it said. Ellen Page, face pale under the glare of the streetlights, stood clutching it. Burma, that land of jade and shadows, ruled by iron fists since '62, a coup's dark echo lingering still. Monks, robed in saffron, had dared to rise, a tide of yellow against the grey. The Saffron Revolution they called it, a whisper of hope choked by the steel of the junta.  \n\nThe air, thick with the scent of jasmine and fear, had tasted of violence. Monasteries, once sanctuaries, lay desecrated, their silence broken only by the ghosts of prayer. A Japanese lensman, Nagai, had seen too much, his camera a silent witness to the junta's wrath. A bullet silenced his voice, a stark footnote to the reign of terror.  \n\nThirteen, they said. The official count. A lie, whispered by the wind, carried on the backs of refugees. Colonel Win, a broken man, a ghost of the army he'd known, spoke of thousands swallowed by the earth. It was a song as old as time, this hunger for power, this thirst to crush dissent underfoot. Caesar, with his legions, the Japanese emperor, a god-king, and Bush, whispered to by Haggard, the shepherd of fools. A tapestry woven with threads of blood, stained by the hands of men who sought dominion. \n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of bodies crushed beneath the iron fist of the state. The whispers of 2,000, 3,000, lost in the official silence.  Rwanda, a genocide painted in the crimson of hate, where neighbor turned on neighbor, fueled by the poison of fear.  And Hitler's Germany, a specter haunting the world, a testament to the darkness that can consume a nation.\n\nThe sign sagged, a burden on Page's shoulders.  A truth too heavy to bear, a truth that refused to be silenced. Burma. A land where history repeats, a land where hope flickers like a dying ember in the wind.",
            "Duke Ellington's shadow stretches long across the jazz landscape. It’s a shadow cast by longevity, by the hand of a man who could mold his orchestra, coax brilliance from its members. Though his own touch on the piano sometimes fades into the background of his compositions, his voice as a composer rings clear. He wove intricate tapestries of sound, rich and complex, that gave every man in his band the space to sing. He built frameworks where solos could breathe, wrote phrases that snagged on the ear, and drew out the particular fire in each player.  He shaped the tone of the whole, birthing sounds that were both coherent and wild, unique to each piece. This mastery of individual voice, and the way those voices bled into a collective whole, brought forth some of the most striking, the most enduring music jazz has ever known. \n\nThe Grove, in its dusty tome, speaks of Ellington's sound, his innovation. It cites \"Creole Love Call,\" a song where the voice itself is made an instrument, a thread woven through his whole career.  This, an early example, shows how he used the voice for texture, for color, unbound by the chains of words. \"Creole Love Call\" also whispers of his skill in letting the soloists bloom. It’s a slow, deliberate blues, twelve bars long, six choruses unfolding like a sigh.\n\nThe first chorus, a call and response, voice and reeds, starts smooth, melodic, then roughens, a growl rising in the throat. The second, a muted trumpet solo, a winding path through the melody, blue notes stretching like shadows. The third, a clarinet like a bird soaring, high and sweet, backed by a piano that whispers in a syncopated dance. The fourth, the whole band echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds answering, a conversation in sound. The fifth, the climax, reeds calling, voices high and urgent, brass and rhythm holding back, a stop-time beat like a held breath. The sixth, back to the first, voice and reeds, but now the voice takes on that growl, a solo instrument in its own right. And then, a brief tag, a vocal run, a trombone with a dissonant sigh, a final whisper.\n\nThis use of voice, this coloring of sound, it’s a thread running through his work. \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, shows him weaving tight orchestration with an ear for tone. A call and response, \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet talking to Baby Cox's scat, the voice a melody, the trumpet a rhythm, a rich tapestry. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" and Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a constant in Ellington's world, introduces the melody on a muted trombone, a sound both mournful and joyous.",
            "The wanting had always been there. A hunger that gnawed. Not for things, not at first. It started in the liminal space between girl and woman, when the world was just beginning to close in.  Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.  Years bled into one another, the wanting sharpening, taking on a new form.  She sought connection, a hand in hers, a gaze that lingered.  But boys, they were like moths drawn to her flame, clumsy and eager, but never quite right. She watched them flit about, these suitors, and wondered at their blindness.  What was it she lacked, this strange emptiness that echoed in her chest? Theories whispered in the back of her mind, shadows skittering across the cavern of her soul, but none offered a satisfying answer.\n\nThe house was usually a place of quiet. Her parents, they moved through the world like ghosts, their voices low murmurs in the stillness. Arguments were rare, a ghost story told only in hushed tones.  The only discord came when she, a whirlwind of energy, clashed against their gentle currents.  She was a storm in a teacup, a bright spark in their quiet lives.\n\nBut today, the air hung heavy. A dissonance crackled in the air. She moved from room to room, searching for solace, when a scream tore through the quiet. Her mother’s voice, sharp and brittle, a broken bird’s song. Panic clawed at her throat. She burst into the kitchen, her heart a drum against her ribs. “Mother? What is it?”\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, a tableau of pain. Her face twisted in agony, her breaths shallow gasps.  “Ow…sweet…get…hospital.”  The words came out in a strangled wheeze. \n\nShe knelt beside her mother, her own hand trembling. “Okay, Mother, tell me where…”\n\nHer mother pointed, a weak gesture, and the daughter knew what she had to do.  The years of lifting weights, of preparing for a battle she never thought she’d have to fight, came flooding back. She lifted her mother, her muscles burning, her heart a lead weight in her chest.\n\nThe hospital reeked of antiseptic and fear. But she barely noticed. All that mattered was her mother, pale and clammy in her arms.  She pushed her way through the throngs of people, her voice a desperate plea.  “Help! My mother!”\n\nDoctors gathered, their faces grim. They whisked her mother away, leaving the daughter standing alone, her hands shaking, her mind a whirlwind of worry.\n\nThe accident was simple, almost mundane. A stepladder, a vase out of reach, a sudden fall.  But in her daughter’s eyes, it was a betrayal, a violation of the fragile peace that had always surrounded them.",
            "This study sought to plumb the depths of a claim: that a way of eating, the Mediterranean Diet, or aMed as it's called, could ward off the slow, creeping cancers of the heart.  It's a life lived closer to the earth, they say, with an abundance of fruits and vegetables, nuts and beans, and the oils of olives. Less meat, less fat, and a measure of wine with meals. \n\nThe old studies hinted at a connection, a whisper of reduced risk in those who embraced this way of life. But this study, it dug deeper. They followed women, strong women in white coats, for two decades, charting their diets and their fates. Thousand upon thousands of these women, their lives laid bare in forms and questionnaires, their meals cataloged with the precision of a surgeon. \n\nThey looked for the toll of heart disease, the sudden darkness of stroke, the slow fade of death itself. The results, stark and undeniable, showed a clear link: those who ate with the sun on their faces, who lived by the rhythm of the seasons, they fared better. Their hearts beat stronger, their strokes were fewer, their lives stretched longer.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, they called it the United States, felt the weight of a coming storm. The air grew thick with the smell of decay, the kind that clings to cities choked by their own ambition. Jobs vanished like smoke in the wind, houses crumbled like rotten teeth, and the giants of industry, the corporations that once seemed invincible, lay broken and bleeding. This sickness, this rot, has lingered. It festers still. A question hangs heavy: how did this come to pass? And how do we stop it from consuming us whole?\n\nThe answer, it whispers in the wind, is a tale of greed and folly, of men in suits who played God with money they didn't understand. They pressed the banks, urged them to lend to those who couldn't pay, to build houses on foundations of sand. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they called these puppets, dancing to the tune of a hollow prosperity. They took these toxic mortgages, repackaged them like poisoned candy, and sold them to anyone who would buy. When the borrowers fell, like dominoes in a child's game, the banks, hollowed out, transferred their plague onto the rest. The contagion spread, infecting the whole body politic.\n\nIt began, they say, back in the Clinton years, when that man, driven by the hunger for power, sought to extend his reign.  He loosened the reins of regulation, fueled the fire of speculation. The New York Times, a thin sheet of paper in the face of the storm, foretold the coming tempest.  They said the government's own hand had planted the seed, and that a reckoning was inevitable.\n\nThe seeds of ruin were sown in the tangled roots of complex mortgages. Adjustable rates, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations – words whispered in hushed tones, carried on the wind like a deadly fog. The housing market, bloated and swollen, became a mirage, shimmering with false promises.  \n\nThen came the crash. The bubble burst, and the giants fell. Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers – their names, once etched in gold, now tarnished and broken. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the survivors, stripped bare and forced to beg for mercy. Fannie and Freddie, crippled by debt, were dragged into the government's embrace.",
            "Exposition. A word that hangs heavy as a shroud over the mind of the young writer. A place where he spreads his wings, yes, but risks a fall from grace. A place where the reader might drift away, eyes glazed over, thumb hovering over the back button, muttering curses under his breath. Dr. Merlin, she's known to raise her voice at the screen, a bellow that shakes the room, when she finds herself drowning in too much telling. \n\nThe old adage rings true: show, don't tell. But even the seasoned hand can stumble.  Exposition, it's a devil on the shoulder, whispering insidious words. \"Get it all out in the open,\" it urges, \"the history, the backstory, the what-ifs.\"  But the devil of exposition is a greedy beast, demanding a feast of detail, a litany of lives lived, a chronicle of every childhood memory. \n\nIt's the voice droning on, a recitation of facts, a flat narrative devoid of lifeblood. Like a mariner recounting a tale of woe, the words pile up, heavy with significance but light on feeling. \n\nTake the story of a woman, a heroine, let us say. We are told she met her love, a grand wedding, a life together, and then, a cruel twist of fate, his murder before her eyes. Two pages, perhaps, devoted to this narrative skeleton. Dialogue sparse, characters hollow.  \n\nBut what of the man?  The husband?  Show us his love through his words, his gestures, the way his eyes light up when he looks at her. Let us see her transformation, how his presence enriched her world, how his absence leaves a gaping hole in her soul.\n\nGive us the flesh and bone, the essence of their connection.  Only then will we mourn his loss with her, only then will we truly understand the weight of her grief.\n\nThe writer's task is not to merely state the facts, but to paint a picture.  To show us the man, the woman, their love, their loss, in all its raw, unvarnished reality.",
            "The eye caught two flickers from Columbus. The first, NBC 4, a morning picture. August 13th, 2011. A man, Hostettler his name, had carved up his wife in Ashley.  They showed his face, a mask of something dark and cold.  Two minutes they gave it, the story unfolding like a bad dream.  Multiple wounds, they said. Arrested.  Enough time, maybe.\n\nNext, a boy, Travis Buyers, eighteen years gone, shot in the woods. No name for the place, just Sharon Woods. Critically injured. No hand to point at, no answers. The SWAT boys were prowling. A brief moment, this one. Maybe the boy was black, maybe not. I've seen this before, year after year. A white child snatched, lost, hurt, and the world screams. A black boy, a whisper, a shadow.\n\nThen, a hole in the sky. A helicopter, Med-Flight, struck by a .22, a rifle bullet. The air thick with questions. Crime-Stoppers, five thousand dollars, a promise of justice.\n\nThe sky again, this time with rain and thunder promised. Mid-eighties, they said, the heat holding on. A tease, a whisper of the storm to come.\n\nA robbery, a UDF on Clime Road. A black man, they said, dark-skinned, a hoodie pulled low. Six feet tall, a hundred and fifty pounds. They lingered on the blackness, a stain on the news.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a name from Texas. Drug kingpin, they said, marijuana flowing like water from south to north.  Twenty-five years, or \"300 months,\" they said, the numbers cold and hard. A Hispanic man, they added, as if it mattered.",
            "The blood ties bind. A kinship forged in fire and shadow. Love and hate, pride and envy, all simmering beneath the skin. Brothers know each other. See into the marrow of the soul. A mirror held up to the self.   \n\n'Tis in the darkest hour that the true nature of this bond reveals itself. For good or ill. The reckoning comes high. To understand the heart of brotherhood is to understand the cost.  To look into a brother's eyes and see not reflection but essence, not the mask but the man. In their deeds and their consequences, their character is laid bare. \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk this path. Through a landscape thick with heat and moss, they make a journey without promise.  Disappointment, bitter as gall, clashes with a pride too fierce to name. One brother survives. The other… not so much.\n\nThe story unfolds through the voice of the elder, his words telling a tale of love twisted and tangled. The younger brother, Doodle, is a frail thing, his spirit fragile as a hummingbird's wing. The narrator's voice, steeped in the weight of his memories, reveals the depths of his own torment, the world as he saw it, shadowed by guilt and the burden of his own making.\n\nPride, that burning ember, fuels the narrator's soul. From the first clumsy steps they shared, a resentment festered. He yearned for a brother worthy of his instruction, a partner in all the wild deeds of boyhood.  \n\nBut Doodle, born with a heart too weak to endure, was a shadow of what he’d imagined. A tremor in the young narrator's soul. A vision of himself reflected back, distorted and marred.  \n\nEven the thought of smothering the boy in his sleep crosses his mind.  A darkness within, a grief so profound it threatened to consume him. Yet, a single smile from Doodle, a spark of light in the darkness, softens the edges of his rage. A flicker of love, fragile as a flame, persists.",
            "The mind. A black box. A labyrinth of shadowed corridors. They’ve tried to map it, these men of science, with their charts and diagrams. Wax tablets, papyrus scrolls, books, even machines of clockwork and wire. But the mind, it ain’t no simple mechanism.\n\nIt takes in the world through senses raw and unfiltered: the sting of wind, the hush of shadows, the flicker of light on bone. The brain, it weaves these threads of sensation into a tapestry of meaning. Bottom-up, they call it, like the building of a house brick by brick. But there’s a higher order at play, a shaping force that pulls the pieces into place. Top-down, they say. The mind knows what it’s looking at before the eyes have truly seen. A box against white. A hole in the light.\n\nAnd within this vast cathedral of thought, there’s a gatekeeper. A filter that sifts the torrent of information, letting through what’s important, silencing the rest. The blades of grass, the murmur of voices, the name whispered in the wind. The mind attends, it filters, it remembers.\n\nMemory, a flickering candle in the dark. Flickers of sensation, sounds, faces, words. Stored in the very fabric of the being, woven into the sinews and the bone.\n\nAnd what of the knowledge itself? A network of threads, they say, connecting ideas like vines in a forest. Concepts linked by association, by blood and bone. A web spun from the substance of experience.\n\nBut the mind, it’s more than a map. It’s a mapmaker. It’s a storm. It’s a song. It’s the echo of a world unseen.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of manufactured happiness. Huxley, he saw it coming, the shadow of the machine creeping ever closer. Technology and the gilded cage of capitalism, they were the twin vipers coiled around the world's throat. In *Brave New World*, he laid bare the bones of their design, a dystopia where community was a cage and instant gratification the only law.  They were pawns, these people, moved by unseen hands, their thoughts as predictable as the gears in a clockwork heart. The World Controller, a puppet master in a sterile white coat, held the strings.\n\nMarx's ghost whispered in the margins, his words a chilling echo in the sterile halls of the World State. Homogeneity, reification, these were the tools of the system, the shackles forged in the fires of an economy built on want. Huxley saw it all, the false consciousness that blinded the masses, the proletariat kept docile by the sugar-coated pill of consumerism.  They were told they were happy, they believed it. The Deltas, the Gammas, they knew nothing else. The drive to consume, to spend, this was their religion, their salvation. A whispered truth, hidden beneath the veneer of manufactured bliss.\n\nHegemony. The ruling class, the Alphas and Betas, they knew the truth. They saw the strings, but they held them, too. A silent pact, a bargain for their own comfort.  The world spun on, driven by the endless churn of the machine.\n\nAnd in this world, love was a ghost, a forgotten memory.  Faces blurred, characters hollowed out, stripped of the richness of human experience.  Even in the touch of flesh, there was only the coldness of metal, the emptiness of a machine. Technology and capitalism, they had devoured the soul.",
            "The sun bled low in the west over the sprawling stone and brick of the campus. Two and a half years,  four and a half semesters. That was the measure of my time here, in this place that seemed to stretch on forever. Getting around, a thing many of us, myself included, wrestled with like a wild beast. Freshman year I was caged in an East Halls room, the farthest point east barring the stadium and that hulking Jordan Center. Getting to Willard, a place as far removed as the moon, could steal twenty minutes, maybe more, on foot. Especially when the sky wept its grey tears, which it often did in this town. A fellow, not much older than myself, an alumnus, spoke of a time when those East Halls stood alone, surrounded by fields of nothing, a waste of space. Now, those fields were swallowed by concrete, by stadiums and new buildings, a sprawling concrete sea. The Creamery, a new health center. Apartments crawled across the land. The campus, a burgeoning beast, consumed all in its path, and with each bite, the journey from one place to the next became a longer, harder trek.\n\nThe solution, I knew, lay in two wheels. The bicycle. But the bike itself was not enough. It needed riders. And the land itself needed to be molded to their need.\n\nI was talking to a friend, a man who had returned to the saddle after years away. He spoke of the ease of it all, the simple joy. “Why ever I stopped,” he said, his voice tinged with wonder, “bikes are the only way.”  A simple truth. A bowl of oats, a bit of sweat, and you could cover miles. I live off campus now, the distance from the heart of the campus as much as any dorm. The best decision I’d made this year, buying a bike. Thomas building, my daily destination, a twenty-five minute walk. On two wheels, it was five, if I pushed hard. The road, Pollock, was the quickest route, but it was a treacherous path.  Walking, there was a certain virtue to it. But time, a precious commodity, was not on my side. Without the bike, walking would be my only tether to the heart of campus. Two and a half hours a week, lost to the walk to Thomas alone. And that was before the other journeys, the appointments, the endless errands. Time, a thief. I couldn't afford to lose it."
