            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The paper concerns itself with the twin shadows of insomnia, the biological and sociocultural. The biological leans towards the hardwired, the genes inherited, the body's mechanics. It seeks the source of sleeplessness in the very marrow. The sociocultural, it casts a wider net, examining the world's pull on the mind, the threads woven through race, class, and circumstance. This review seeks to unravel both these threads, to trace the paths of research that illuminate these models, to weigh their findings against the anvil of reality. \n\nSleeplessness takes many forms. Primary, where the roots lie solely within the self. Dyssomnias, the disorders of sleep itself, where the body rebels against its call. Or Parasomnias, where the sleep landscape is twisted, dreams bleeding into waking hours. Then there are the disorders born of other ailments, mental or physical, or the poison of substance. Primary Insomnia, the inability to find rest, Primary Hypersomnia, the weight of endless slumber. Narcolepsy, the thief of control, stealing the body's strength, leaving it trembling in the wake of sleep's embrace.  \n\nThe biological model whispers of neurons, of the hypothalamus, the orexin, the conductor of sleep and wakefulness. This study, it delves into the brains of mice, their GABAB receptors, keys that unlock the gates of slumber. A flick of the switch, a manipulation of these receptors, and sleep emerges, a tide receding and returning. \n\nBut the question remains: can we extrapolate these findings to the human condition? Is this mouse a mirror held to our own souls? If so, what does it tell us?  A flaw in this receptor, a genetic quirk, could leave a man adrift in a sea of sleepless nights. And the sociocultural echoes? If this predisposition is inherited, it paints a grim picture. A child born into a world where sleep eludes them, a burden passed down through generations, hindering their every waking moment. School, work, the mundane tasks of life, all become poisoned by sleeplessness, a constant struggle against the tide.",

Then, the ways of knowing if it's there, the telltale signs. And finally, how a teacher in a room full of sound might help a child who bears this weight.\n\nCAPD, or APD, they say it's a matter of how the mind makes sense of what the ears hear. The brain, the central nervous system, can't quite do its job right. The sound gets there, clear enough, but the switching, the sorting, the making of meaning, it falters. The ears ain't the problem, it's what comes after. The soul of the hearing, they say. \n\nThey first whispered about this in the fifties, 'auditory imperception' was the name then.  Kids with troubles speaking, they thought something was amiss. Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari, testing the children in Italy. Kimura, in '61, spoke of dichotic testing, the way the brain splits the sound world.  A conference in '77, a gathering of minds, and the talk turned to this thing, this CAPD.\n\nThe signs, they come in many forms. Sound, it may not be heard right, lost in the spaces between. Words, they may blend together, indistinguishable. Patterns, unseen. Sarcasm, a change in tone, lost on the ear. One sound buries the next.  The mind, it can't weave the threads of sound into a tapestry of meaning.\n\nTo find it, they observe, they test.  Audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, they all have their tools. Questionnaires, observations, sounds presented and responses measured. No single test, no surefire sign. The cause, a mystery.  Some tests, they bombard the ears with noise, see if the mind can pick out the signal. Others, they measure the echoes within the ear, the brain's own whispers.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night. It speaks to the nature of disguise, how it can serve a purpose, a dark purpose, but how in the end it eats away at a man, a woman, a soul. To shed the mask, to reveal the face beneath, that is a risk. A risk of exile, of being cast out by those who knew you only in the shadows. \n\nThe question then becomes one of choice. To preserve the self, or the fragile threads of connection that bind us to others. Some will turn away from the truth, others will bear it like a wound.

That is the question Viola wrestles with, driven by a need for survival.  \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" she says. A foreign land, a perilous journey, and the weight of her own identity cast off like a discarded coat. But the disguise takes hold, alienating her from her own kind, severing the bonds of sisterhood. \n\nAnd then there is the confusion, the tangled web of desire. Olivia, caught in the snare of Viola's fabricated masculinity, falls for the phantom, calling her \"husband.\" Orsino, the Duke, consumed by his own melancholia, finds himself drawn to the charade, confessing his love for the boy Cesario. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nThis play, it speaks of hidden desires, unveiled by the artifice. Does Olivia truly yearn for men, or does she mistake the mask for the man? Or is it a mockery of her own society, a reflection of their shallow judgments?  The truth lies somewhere in the shadows, obscured by the play's own ambiguity. Olivia, she moves from Cesario to Sebastian with a swiftness that suggests a heart easily swayed. And Viola, stripped of her disguise, is embraced as a sister, not a lover. The mask removed, the truth revealed. But at what cost?",
            "The shadow of empire fell heavy on the land. German, they called it. Brutality, a word whispered in the dust, etched in the bones of the Ovaherero, the Nama. Genocide, a stain on the sun-bleached plains of South West Africa. But empire, like the land itself, was a vast and varied thing. Policies, like the shifting sands, flowed in different currents.  Education, too, wore many faces.  East Africa, Tanganyika, taken by the British under a different sky, held a people literate, educated, their minds touched by the German hand.  Kamerun, too, bore witness to such endeavors.\n\nBut South West Africa, a land of stark contrasts, held a different story.  Here, the state, the iron fist of government, did not reach out to the native.  The task of instruction, of shaping young minds, fell to the missionaries, their churches echoing with hymns and prayers, their schools a refuge, a lifeline.  Limited, meager, the government’s support. Yet, the Europeans, the settlers who carved their names on the landscape, they were different.  State schools rose for them, their education nurtured, their futures assured.\n\nThe legacy of these policies, like the ghosts of the past, lingered. While East Africa boasted a literate citizenry, South West Africa remained cloaked in ignorance.  A vast majority, untouched, uneducated, their words lost in the wind.  What forces, what unseen hands, shaped this divergence? This paper seeks to delve into the hearts of the settlers, into the minds of the authorities, to uncover the reasons, the justifications, the justifications…\n\nThe books speak of this, written in tongues of German and English, their pages filled with narratives of education, of systems, of comparisons.  Cohen, a scholar, a seeker of truth, he wrote of South West Africa, of East Africa, drawing parallels, illuminating the differences.  He saw in the settler population, the driving force behind the divide.  \n\nSouth West Africa, a land of temperate climes, a land where even the desert held a certain beauty, it attracted the Europeans.  In 1913, nearly fifteen thousand of them walked its soil, more than any other colony save East Africa.",
            "Popular music, a sprawling, tangled thing, has grown beyond counting in these last hundred years. Genres, like roots spreading, creep and intertwine. The names alone - rap, rock, country, jazz, folk - whisper of a multitude. And within each, a thicket of subgenres, deeper still, branching out like veins in a corpse. Heavy metal, that brooding child of rock, has become a world unto itself in the last four decades. A world of noise and fury, expressing the dark corners of the soul. It ain't pretty, but it's honest. Diversified, too. Bands took the raw materials, twisted and turned them, birthing subgenres that spawned sub-subgenres, and so on, a fractal of sound echoing out into the night.\n\nNow, the metal beast has grown so vast, so many heads, it's hard to say what it truly is. It's absorbed threads from every other genre, a chameleon of sound. But every beast has a genesis. To understand the metal that bleeds out of every speaker, you gotta dig down, find that first spark. Metal ain't just a genre. It's a movement, a force of nature.\n\nDarkness is its creed. More bass, more volume, more violence. Less innocence, more goddamn skill. Metal musicians, they know their instruments like they know their own bones. And like a fever dream, it's fueled by the haze. The psychedelic boom of the seventies, it turned minds to acid, spewing forth music that was wild and strange. It was a soundtrack to the apocalypse, a reflection of the world fracturing around them. Visceral, raw, honest. Something new in a world of polished pop. And the ghosts of Romanticism, they whisper in the shadows, their darkness echoing through the decades. \n\nLyrics like these, they speak to the heart of it:\n\n*Helter Skelter*\n\nThe Beatles, they  wrote it, a glimpse into the darkness that lurked beneath the surface. A spiral, a descent, the highs and lows of a drug-fueled journey. Some say it's the first metal song, a challenge to the Stones, a declaration of their own darkness.",
            "The Surrealists, they came along later, with their strange visions of dreamscapes. But before them, there was Rousseau, painting his own dreams, real as the brushstrokes themselves. The Dream, 1910, a canvas thick with his longing. Not just a woman lost in wonder, but Rousseau’s own heart laid bare. He dreamed of being seen, of the brushstrokes earning their keep, of the whispers in polite art circles. But the world, it was a hard place. To be accepted, to be deemed worthy, did he have to mimic the ghosts of masters past? Or carve his own path, a lonely road under an unforgiving sun?\n\nThe Dream, it holds the answer, or at least a piece of it. To understand it, you gotta know his story. Born in Laval, a small town in the north, to a tinsmith with a taste for comfort. No schooling in the fine arts, just the toll booths and the dust of the road, a gabelou, they called him. Douanier, the customs man, a name he wore like a borrowed coat.  His first wife, Clémence, vanished with eight children, leaving him with a daughter, Julia, and a grief that tasted like ash. Painting, it became his refuge, his way to stitch together the torn edges of his soul.\n\nHe wasn't like the other painters, those who romanticized the peasant life. Rousseau was the peasant, his canvas a reflection of their hopes and dreams. \n\nHe hungered for acceptance, and no wonder. He started late, with no guidance, a voice crying out in a wilderness of talent. Matisse, he was already making a name, while Rousseau toiled in the shadows. To be admitted to the Artiste Français, he thought, he had to paint what they wanted, what was expected.\n\n“Matisse, he feared the ordinary,” wrote Jan Gordon, a chronicler of the age, “but Rousseau yearned for it, for a way in.”",
            "The notion of a kinship 'tween ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty, has been pondered by many a thinker. A reason, I believe, lies at the heart of it. As Keats writes, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we grasp in this life comes from the books we read or the roads we walk. Yet, ethics and aesthetics, like Keats suggests, seem to take root in us without the hand of instruction. Both are more a matter of describing than dictating. Our study of right and wrong, of beauty, is largely an attempt to unravel the why—why a canvas sings, why an act aligns with the moral compass. Not a rulebook for judgment or creation, mind you.\n\nCriticism, be it of art or morals, can never fully grasp the essence of what's good or what's beautiful. Talk of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might delve into foreground, background, contrast, the weight of history. But these things, they don't tell the whole story. When asked about a cherished work, a piece of writing that lingers, you'll often hear, \"There's just something about it,\" before the words stumble to explain. Art and morals, I reckon, they can't be fully pinned down. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way ... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how sharp the description, something transcendent remains. Ethics, I believe, has this same quality. Wittgenstein, he wrote, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It's this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, that gives art and morality their power, their connection to something beyond.\n\nMorality and art, they bind us because we experience them, not with our minds alone, but with a deeper knowing, a noumenal sense.  Literature, with its words that bleed into the soul, is especially potent. As McKean put it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The Germany of now, a fortress nation. Strong. Bound by a blood-forged culture, from the shadow of the Alps in München to the damp stones of Kiel on the Baltic.  From Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of the land, to Dresden, a city carved from stone on the Elbe. A tapestry woven from threads of many tongues and traditions. It's no wonder, then, that this Germany, this entity, sprang not from a single seed but from a confluence of tribes, of bloodlines tangled in the mists of time.\n\nGermania. The name itself, a whisper from the past, a bone thrown to the dogs of history. Its meaning, a battlefield of scholars' ink. Tacitus, that grim chronicler, claimed it hailed from the Tungrians, a tribe that once roamed these lands before the Rhine became their battleground. A name they wore like a shield against the Gauls. Caesar, that ravenous Caesar, first etched \"Germanus\" into his annals, a word borrowed from the conquered Gauls to separate foe from friend. A distinction drawn in blood. Some say it echoed a word from the Gaulish tongue, a neighbor's name. Caesar himself, in his first chapter on the Gallic Wars, writes of these men, \"Germans... who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"\n\nOthers whisper of a different origin. A spear, the \"ger,\" wielded by these warriors. Or perhaps from the Old Irish \"garim,\" a shout, a challenge, a roar that echoed across the plains. A testament to a people who spoke loud and lived loud. \n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 testament, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" paints a picture of a people untouched, unadulterated. \"I should regard them (the Germans) as aboriginal,\" he writes, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" A land they held sacred,  \"a wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect.\" A land that repelled the Romans, those who sought to carve their own empire from the world.\n\nThey came to its borders, these Romans, driven by greed for its treasures. They sent out their legions, tasted the land's bounty, but ultimately, the call of Rome was too strong. They returned, leaving the Germanic tribes to their own devices, to the shaping of their own destinies.",
            "The bowl stared back. A dark abyss. Not emptiness, not quite.  Something hung there.  A presence.  Thought, if it could be called that, came and went like desert wind.  A flicker. A sigh.  The artist’s words came back, a whisper now, from years ago.  Frame it.  Simplify.  But the frame wouldn't hold.  The scene pressed in, too much, too much detail.   Picasso, he had his blues. Monet, his greens.  The Italians, a riot of color.  And me?  Me, I was drowning in brown.  This was it.  The start.  The story waiting to be told.  The work.  \n\nFingertips touched the cold porcelain.  Muscles tensed, a slow tremor running up the arm.  A will to shape, to form.  The water, a mirror, still and deep.  A shiver down the spine.  The brown thing, it resisted.  Stuck like a leech.  More water.  More swirling, more pushing.  Muscles strained, a beat of panic.  A smack.  The handle of the toilet.  A splash.  The water.  The brown thing.\n\nMop in hand.  Tie choking.  The air thick.  A message left.  A silent scream.  He thought it was art.\n\nMore water.  More stillness.  Then the hand reached for the paper.  Wrapped it around itself, a shroud.  A glove.  A second skin.\n\nThe hand dipped.  Slow.  Deep.  Like a mother reaching for her child.  But this child was not born of love.  This child was born of need.  Of desperation.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones.  A confluence of things. The kind of fatal vector that lays bare the frailty of youth.  The doctors say the brain ain't full grown. Not ready for the road.  And the road, it chews up the inexperienced. More wrecks. More roll-overs. More speed. More straying from the line.  Kids their age piled in. A known fact. The California people, they did a study.  Linked the age of the passenger to the odds of a wreck. It's a dark math.\n\nThey try to hold them back.  Temporary licenses, hours clipped, no young'uns in the back.  But that ain't the answer. The truth is, the young ones, by the numbers, they ain't ready.  Not for the weight of it. Not for the risk.  The doctor Zuckerman, he says eighteen's too young. Says they crave the edge, the rush. The need for speed. It's in their blood.  Let 'em wait.  Let the fire in their belly cool a little. \n\nKeep 'em off the road. A few more years.  The numbers don't lie. The road's a hungry thing. And soon enough, the next generation will be coming. Millions of them. Ready to drive.\n\nWe could teach them.  Driver's ed.  But the wheel, no.  Not till they're older.  Let 'em get some sense in their heads.  Then a permit.  Then the hours behind the wheel.  The same hours every state's got.  California's got six hours behind the wheel and fifty with an adult.  That's the way.  Nationwide.  One law.  One rule for all.\n\nIt ain't a new idea.",
            "The Library of Congress, a repository of shadows and dust, held a cache of Edison's early films. Fifteen trick films, fragments of a forgotten time, flickered to life between 1895 and 1901. Illusions, spun from the threads of editing, danced across the screen. My study sought to map the poetics of these phantoms, to trace the ghosts of innovation that haunted their later brethren. \n\nMostly, these films were bound to the stage, trapped within the frame of a proscenium. The camera, a watchful eye, remained fixed, unmoving. Long shots and the occasional medium shot, devoid of close-ups, held sway.  A single idea, a single moment, captured in a single shot. The one-shot rule, a strict code, dictated the length, seldom exceeding a minute, a blink in the vast expanse of time.  \n\nThe stage's legacy lingered. Figures moved side to side, bound by the proscenium's invisible bars. Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, a film from the year 1900,  offered a stark example. Actors marched in and out, confined to the horizontal axis, the camera unyielding in its gaze.  No pursuit, no movement towards or away.\n\nLike phantoms on a stage, these films existed in a world of artifice. Close-ups, a language of intimacy, were absent. The audience, as in the theater, beheld the whole, framed within the proscenium's embrace.  Narrative, confined by the single shot, was sparse. The films were vaudeville in essence, a series of tricks—magic, disappearances, substitutions— fleeting moments of wonder.\n\nBut appearances can be deceiving. One conceptual shot, a single breath of the story, might be a tapestry woven from many threads. Mary, Queen of Scots, a film from 1895, offered a glimpse into this hidden world. The severed head, a phantom image, hinted at the artifice, the joins in the fabric.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline. A man of the soil. A farmer. But not just any farmer. He held fast to a creed, a vision of a republic built on the back of the land, on the sweat of honest labor.  His words, they rang out like a hammer blow, striking at the heart of government, demanding liberty, demanding freedom from the grasping hands of power. His creed, it was born of the earth, of the furrows he plowed, of the harvest he reaped. He saw the government as a blade, sharp and dangerous, capable of cutting away at the very fabric of a free man's life.\n\nHe believed the young nation held a promise, a chance to forge a new path, unburdened by the ghosts of old empires. The land, it was a canvas, and the people, the artists. They could paint a picture of self-governance, a nation where the rights of man, like the roots of a mighty oak, stood firm and unshakeable.  He saw these rights as a fragile web, interconnected, each strand dependent on the others.  If one broke, the whole tapestry frayed.\n\nBut Taylor knew the darkness within man, the hunger for power, the instinct to dominate.  He spoke of a duality, a battle that raged within every heart, a struggle between good and evil.  He believed a government must be built to withstand this storm, to hold back the tide of corruption.  He sought a government that protected property, that nurtured the land, that kept the wolves of capitalism at bay.\n\nHe called for a government of limited scope, bound by the chains of the Constitution, its powers spelled out in black and white.  He saw the danger of a sprawling, bloated government, a beast that consumed all in its path. But a simple reading of the words, he warned, was a dangerous path. The spirit, the intent, it must be understood. He looked to the Declaration of Independence, a testament to the sovereignty of the states, the foundation of their freedom.",
            "The figures, they told a story. Figure Seventeen, it showed a fall off, a sudden drop in those commuter logs come the third month. A kind of dying ember. It was disquietening to see it, hard to say why the fire went out. Winter had come to the New England campus, biting wind and snow. Fewer souls on bikes or on foot, that much was clear. And December, it was the end of the fall term, a time for books and deadlines and the frantic scramble to close out the semester. The log, it might have slipped the mind, lost in the shuffle. Then came the holidays, a season of rushing and feasting, and the campus emptied, folks scattered to their homes. Come January, the spring term began, and still the logs were scant. February, it was a mystery.\n\nThe project, it had a life of its own, a quick burst of energy at first, like a flame ignited. Then, the natural pull of the embers, a fading glow. To fight it, they put on a show, a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, a blaze of prizes and promises. It worked, the logs climbed back up. But the lesson was clear: keeping the fire burning, that's a fight. The holidays, the breaks, the natural ebb and flow of things, they all work against you.\n\nAnother thing, people and their cars. Freedom, independence, that's what they crave, woven into the fabric of this land. So carrots, they had to offer carrots. Gift cards here, a massage there, a book, a cup of coffee. It worked, but maybe more could have been done. A bicycle, a sleek hybrid, even a silent electric car, those would have been prizes worth fighting for. Maybe then the logs wouldn't have fallen so low. The prizes, they stayed the same. But what if they grew, a promise of something better, something bigger? A bicycle in December, then a hybrid in January, a whisper of an electric car in February. Maybe then, the fire wouldn't have died.",
            "The Exchange Traded Fund, or ETF, a curious construct. Like an index fund, it seeks to mirror a collection of assets, be it a market index, a commodity, or a basket of securities. Yet it moves with the quickness of a lone stock, traded on the open exchange. It offers the spread of the index, the freedom of a single share. You can sell it short, leverage its rise, buy in fractions. Its cost, a shadow compared to the mutual fund's burden. But there is a price for this agility - a commission for every trade, a toll on the path.  And there are others, whispers of danger. Can the diversification it promises truly hold, or is it a mirage? \n\nThis, then, is the question we grapple with: the ETF IHF. We dissect its heart, its ten biggest holdings, which claim dominion over 63.58% of its assets. Can these ten stand in for the whole? Do they truly capture the essence of the fund, or are they but a flawed reflection?\n\nWe examine their influence, their weight in the portfolio's rise and fall, their Beta, their return.  A portfolio built on these ten, we find, would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself. Its Beta, a measure of volatility, would be lower, a whisper in the storm.\n\nBut is this difference real, or a figment of chance? To answer, we delve deeper, measuring the standard deviation of each stock, their inherent risk, and compare it against the ETF's own.",
            "Dream-Land, one of Poe's own pronouncements, a better thing. In it, words like \"Thulé,\" whispered twice, echo back from Virgil. A place north of Britain, a rim of the known world, the Greeks called it. Virgil used it, that's certain. But a shadow falls, a more immediate source. Poe, he was drawn to the dark German tongues.\n\nThis much is said in the book, Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, by Karl J. Arndt. The two poems, he sees a kinship, a likeness in their sorrow. Poe, mimicking the German master.\n\nThe Oxford Companion speaks of Goethe, his Faust, a play in two parts, the first birthing in 1808, the second in the year of the master's own passing, 1832. Within this second part, a poem, \"The King of Thulé.\" A king, grief-stricken, his queen gone, a goblet her parting gift. He drinks, remembers, and finally, finds his solace in death. The king of Thulé, the king of Poe's dream, shadows entwined, a doppelganger of loss, a crutch of drink.\n\nFaust, translated into play by H.P. Grattan, just a year before Poe's own use of \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" \n\n\"Ultima Thule,\" whispered once in the Pit, but twice in Dream-Land, bookends of the poem. The King of Thulé, Dream-Land, companions on this dark journey. The speaker, he walks through the landscape of Thulé, a land of shades, of ghosts, of a world drained of color. It echoes the king's grief, his loneliness, the slow decay of his will.\n\nGoethe, a titan of language, a name known to Poe, if for no other reason than his admiration for Tennyson.

Say a woman, Jennifer Palmer, slips on a puddle of applesauce in a store, a place they call D&D Markets.  And say the manager, a man named Martin, he's been told twice about the mess, twice!  But he's busy with his supper, he says.  A half-hour passes, the woman falls, breaks her back. Now she wants more than just what the doctor's gonna cost her. She wants to bleed the man dry.  She wants punishment.\n\nThe judge, he ain't gonna throw her claim out just like that.  California law says a man can be made to pay more if he acted with a kind of knowing disregard for the harm he might cause.  Despicable, they call it.  Jennifer, she'll say Martin knew the applesauce was a danger, knew folks had been slipping before.  Six times, she'll say, in the year gone by.  And still he didn't clean it up.  \n\nNow, whether his actions were truly despicable, that's a tougher call.  But it's a question for a jury.  And the facts, well, they speak for themselves.  The day of the spill, a young man, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce.  Martin, he says he's on break, no time for complaints. Then another man, Mary Haddigan, he tells Martin too. Same answer.  Half an hour later, Jennifer Palmer comes along, slips, and falls.  \n\nThe question is, did Martin know the applesauce was a danger?  Did he willfully ignore it?

            "Four years gone now, a course in Islam taken at CBC.  The air hung thick with the smoke of argument, the question burning bright: Was Islam a religion of violence? It seems a question more urgent now than ever.  The world's eye, since that day in '01, has shifted. From the glare of hostility towards Islam, towards the extremists, to a tolerance bordering on the blind. A man named Barack Obama, a name that might have been met with scorn back then, could now stand for the highest office.  A man with a lineage entwined with the faith.\n\nThe Prophet's story, it has a pull. The facts I'd gathered, the history I'd absorbed, painted a different picture. Muhammad, the conqueror, the one who subjugated tribes, forcing them to bend the knee to his God. But the biography, it tells another tale. A man of humility, misunderstood, even. He offered his truth, and men, drawn to its light, came to him.\n\nA shadow falls over the similarities between the ministries. Jesus, the Son of Man, and Muhammad, each with their miracles. A feast multiplied from meager provisions to feed forty. It's a deliberate echo, a striving to cast Muhammad as a prophet of simple truth, needing no grand pronouncements. A fallacy, a cheap trick. It diminishes the miracle of Christ, steals his light. \n\nThe stories, they strive to prove the truth of the faith, the power of conversion.  But they whisper, they relay, they recount tales told through a veil of second, third, and fourth-hand accounts.  The truth fades, obscured, leaving behind a shadow of doubt.\n\nThe most troubling thing, the weight that settles in the gut, is the attempt to elevate Muhammad.  A man of gentleness, wisdom, and grace. But history, it tells a different story. A tale of ambition, of conquest. One wonders, if true history were known, would the faith itself be shaken? Would the edifice of belief crumble?",
            "The Word went out, spoken and carried on the wind. But the wind, it shifts. The currents of thought, they turned, leaving the man from Nazareth behind in the dust. Look back, and you’ll see the path of Christ’s flock straying, year by year, further from the shepherd’s fold. This world now, it spins faster, hungers for change, for a new dawn. The old ways cling, a brittle husk, resisting the tide. But the tide, it won’t be denied. \n\nA remembering will come, a yearning for the bone of truth buried under layers of creed and dogma.  A sifting, a searching.  Decades, maybe centuries, it will take.  But the river runs back to the source.  The clock hands will turn, one by one, stripping away the accretions, leaving bare the stark words of the man who walked the hills of Galilee.  \n\nThis wind will blow across the land, from sea to shining sea.  It will gather the faithful, not to a single flock, but to a single understanding.  The church, the institution, it will stand, a weathered sentinel, guiding the way.  Yet the flock will be thinned, the multitude of voices unified in the purity of the original song. \n\nThis is how history bends, how empires rise and fall, how darkness yields to light.  Remember the Romans, who once crushed the Christians beneath their heel? Now they kneel before the very cross they erected. Remember the chains that bound the enslaved, and the day they rose.  \n\nThis too, will come to pass.  We must learn to read the scriptures anew, not with the eye of the letter, but with the heart of the spirit.  \n\nFor before Jesus came, there was only the echo of the One true God.

He'd take a word, a thing, and pair it with something else, something it don't rightly belong with, and suddenly, you see it in a new light. He did this with colors, too. Gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. He'd stain them with meaning, make them hum with a certain resonance, then he'd fling them back at you, these colors, to remind you of what he wanted you to feel about something. He did it with white and gray, these two sides of the same coin. White, clean, a kind of false purity. Gray, the fading of it all.\n\nHe starts laying it down early, this meaning, in this story of Gatsby's. Daisy and Jordan, always in white.  Everyone in white, it seems. Nick in his white flannels, Tom in his white shirt, Catherine powdered white as bone. Even the party, when Nick is trying to get a handle on it, there's a break from the white, a burst of gaudy color. But the white comes back, a constant, a tide.  He sees it in the buildings, the names on a list, even the way the people move through the city. It's everywhere.\n\nThen, when you think you've got it figured out, he takes the white and the gray and he leans in close, and he shows you Daisy. And she's lost in the white again, a ghost in a little white roadster. Not a woman, not really. Just a thing he wants, a white dream. And the gray, it creeps in around her too, a haze of fur, a whisper of forgotten things.  He's making a point, you see. Daisy isn't just a woman.

Tomatoes plump beneath the endless sky, citrus trees groan with fruit, and the land whispers its secrets in the rustle of leafy greens and the scent of ripe squash and the bitter bite of pepper.

Farther out, beyond the clamor, the farms stand silent, offering more than just sustenance. There, on these sun-baked acres, you might find a man with calloused hands and eyes that hold the wisdom of the soil, offering tours through the rows of plants and the fields where birds sing their silent songs. This, they say, is the way. A way to feed the soul and the body, to walk the path of the earth and leave it richer for your passing.\n\nBut the path is not always easy. The earth demands respect, a constant vigilance against the pests that gnaw and the weeds that choke. The hands that toil are weary, the back aches with the burden of labor. The yields may come smaller, the losses heavier, but the reward lies in the whispers of the wind through the trees, the dance of the butterflies, the symphony of life that blooms in the absence of poison.\n\nThis land, this parcel of chaparral and oak woodland, sits heavy with history. It has known the touch of ancient people, the rumble of cattle hooves, the silence of forgotten dreams. It is a place where the whispers of the past mingle with the cries of the present, a tapestry woven from the threads of time. Here, in the shadow of the Cleveland National Forest, the land and the people stand at a crossroads. They say there are programs, whispers of assistance, to help those who choose this path, to help them find balance, to heal the land and themselves. But the burden of choice rests on their shoulders, a heavy weight in the hands of a farmer who seeks both profit and peace.",
            "The land of culture, it ain't a clear path. It's more like a tangled thicket, shadows and sunlight mingling. You can't grasp it whole, can't pin it down.  Sayin' all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, that's like trying to paint a whole sky with a single brushstroke. Too broad, too quick. \n\nYou gotta learn the rhythm of the place, the music it plays. How it whispers in the wind, how it echoes in the heart. A man walkin' into a foreign land sees it through the lens of his own, comparisons bloomin' up like weeds. \n\nUnderstanding another's way, that's a journey.  You gotta pore over their histories, their scars and their stories. But don't go in to judge or change it. Just breathe it in, feel its weight. Work within its lines, especially if you're standin' at a disadvantage. Out there, respect's your only shield against the unknown.\n\nCulture ain't just about borders, it's a web woven tight.  Even within a nation, companies build their own little worlds.  Some run on long days and hard labor, others on a more leisurely pace.  Look at their clothes, how they speak, who they trust.  It's all there, writ in the lines of their faces, the way they move.\n\nValues, now those are the heart of the matter. They tell you why a culture ticks.  If shame is a heavy weight, a man won't risk it for a deal. If hardship is a badge of honor, he'll fight tooth and nail.\n\nBefore you sit at the table, you gotta know these things. But even then, learn the man across from you.  Find the threads that bind, the common ground. That's where the real bargainin' begins.",
            "The fool, he'd say in his heart, \"No God.\"  Psalm 14, the Book of Psalms, says so. And Anselm, the holy man, he built his case on those words.  The same God, the God of the Covenant, is the God that Aquinas spoke of too.  So we'll assume they both knew him, this God, the one from the scriptures. Otherwise, comparing their arguments would be like comparing apples to... well, something else entirely.\n\nNow, both men, they had their points. But neither, not really, gave us a whole picture. A complete grounding for belief.\n\nTake Anselm first.  He looked inward, to the soul. He said, to understand God, you have to look within. For if you can conceive of God, you can't conceive of him not being. It's a tangled path, this one, his words sometimes hard to follow. But the heart of it is this: God is known through the knowing itself. He's within us already. No need for signs or wonders, just the sureness of what we know. Faith, they call it.\n\nAquinas, he was different.  He sought proof in the world, in the things we can see and touch.  No faith needed, he said, just reason.  Five arguments he laid out, each one a building block. Change, cause, chance, degrees of perfection, and the harmony of the universe.  He said, if you see a puzzle missing a piece, you know it's there, even if you can't see it. The logic of it demands it.",
            "The man they called Buddha was born, somewhere in the shadow of that long ago century, fifth or sixth. A prince, he cast aside the world, sought the silence within. His words took root and grew, flowering into the faith of Buddhism, a tendril of which was known as Theravada. Five hundred years have turned since his passing, and the tendrils have stretched, taken on new forms. In Sri Lanka, where the Theravada roots run deep, they hold a ceremony, cutting water. Monks and the lay folk alike gather, a ritual born not of Buddha's own hand but of time and change. The differences, they run deep, from the surface of things to the heart of the matter. Both monk and layman, bound by the faith, have had to shift, to bend the ancient doctrines to the wind. Forces, both dark and light, have pressed upon them.\n\nThere are words we'll be using, words to guide us through this tangled wood. Internal, external. The internal is born of the followers of the Buddha's path, whether robed or not. The external, from those who walk a different road. Hostile, a force that seeks to wound the faith, to twist and break its branches. Benign, a force that means neither harm nor good, but which may bring one or the other in its wake. These words, they will echo through these pages.\n\nFirst, let us speak of the core. The doctrines that bind the Theravada heart. They seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, it is the Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. Suttas, Vinaya, Abhidhamma. The Suttas, the words of the Buddha. The Vinaya, the rules of conduct, the path laid out for both monk and layman. The Abhidhamma, the metaphysics, the nature of being. The teachings of no-self, of suffering, of impermanence. These are the truths that bind and break the wheel of Samsara, the endless turning of birth and death. Desire, hatred, delusion, all fade when the light of enlightenment breaks through. In the Vinaya, the rules are laid out, five for the layman, a shield against harm: no killing, no lying, no stealing, no unchastity, no intoxication. For the monk, the path is longer, the rules more intricate. But at the heart, the four noble truths remain: the truth of suffering, the truth of its cause, the truth of its cessation, the truth of the path that leads to it.",
            "The two nations, the United States and Mexico, were once bound by a rivalry that stretched like a long, lean shadow, fifty-seven years from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The high tide of this animosity crested in the Mexican-American War, a conflict of 1846-1848 where the United States, in a swift and brutal reckoning, subdued Mexico. Texas and the Southwest fell into American hands, wounds fresh and festering.  \n\nBut this was only the storm's eye. Smaller skirmishes, like brush fires, flared between the two nations, finally dying down in the hushed stillness before the First World War.  The roots of their discord ran deep, tangled in religion, culture, and the tangled web of material interests. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dance of rivalry is not unfamiliar. Nations that share a border, their fates intertwined, often find themselves locked in a struggle for dominance, a tug-of-war over land and resources.  The United States and Mexico are but one example among many.  David M. Pletcher (1977) wrote, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both nations, geographically close, have stood in opposition to American expansion, while others in Latin America have found more fertile ground for cooperation.\n\nReligion, a potent and divisive force, also cast a dark shadow over their relationship. Sally Frahm (2001) points out, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Like the Cold War, a battle fought not just on battlefields but in the minds of men, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was fueled by a clash of ideologies, albeit ones rooted in faith, not politics.  This distrust, inherited from the old empires, the English and the Spanish, proved a formidable barrier to any hope of lasting peace.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalogued seventeen disputes between the two nations during that fifty-seven year period. Most were skirmishes over territory, border raids, and the ever-present threat of violence at the frontier.  Bandits and outlaws, like wolves on the prowl, preyed on both sides of the border, their presence a constant reminder of the volatile tension. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to wane as Mexico, caught in the grip of need, leaned heavily on the United States for support.  (p. 109)  In the dying embers of the nineteenth century, American ambitions shifted from territorial conquest to a more insidious form of control: economic intervention in Mexico. (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years gone now.  A sudden sickness, a fate unseen. It took hold like a fever, stole my strength, left me hollowed out. A nurse I was, back then. The steady work, the comfort of the sickbed, a shield against the ghosts of a childhood too harsh. \"Always a need,\" they'd say, \"for hands that mend. People will always be broken.\" So I built my life on that promise.  Science, journalism, those were the dreams, buried deep. But the need was stronger.\n\nForty-six years, alone, with nothing but dust in the bank. The years crawl on, fifteen of them, stretched thin on a government's meager grace. My own, I own nothing.  A hand-to-mouth existence, each day a battle against the gnawing fear, the hollow ache of what might have been. Nothing certain but the cold grip of need. Yet through it all, a truth remains. Family, friends, a lifeline thrown.  They held me steady when the world spun. And believe this, in the face of true ruin, you find out just how empty your strength is.\n\nLife, it throws its storms. Big and small, they come without warning. No map, no guide.  We can preach preparedness, build our bunkers, but some things are too vast, too cruel.\n\nThey say we must cut our ties with the government, its ship run aground.  But what good is a lone island when the sea is rising?  I say, let us learn to trust again, to build bridges, to share the burden. Our forefathers, they didn't conquer hardship alone. It was compassion, respect, the sharing of what little they had that saw them through. The wagons trains, they rolled westward on shared hope, not rugged defiance.\n\nBe ready, yes, I am.  Water purification, canned goods, a first-aid kit, the tools to weather the storm.   A wood stove, a garden if you have the land. But alongside these things,  reach out. Know your neighbor, their story, their struggles. For in the end, it is the bonds we weave that will endure.",
            "The question of form, of how life takes shape, has haunted the minds of men since time immemorial.  Why do these creatures twist and turn, these shells, these bones, into the patterns they do? Are there invisible threads guiding them, unseen constraints upon their becoming?  Even now, the naturalist barely scratches the surface, struggling to capture the essence of creation in the cold logic of numbers.  Yet men have tried.  They have sought to quantify the dance of the whorls, to map the spiral path of growth in these mollusk shells, these Prunum.  \n\nThey speak of mathematical models, of software that can conjure forms, and they delve into the past, tracing the lineage of these shells through the eons. They peer into the heart of the shell, the columella, that central thread through which the whorls unfurl.  They count the turns, the sutures that bind them, the aperture that breathes life into the empty form.  And they seek to understand, to unravel the mystery of how these silent creatures, these Prunum, have shaped themselves through the endless passage of time. \n\nThey speak of the shell as a journey, a pilgrimage through space and time, a spiral path etched into the fabric of existence.  They see the apex, the starting point, the base where it rests.  They trace the path of the aperture, the opening through which life itself emerges.  They try to capture the essence of this journey, to translate it into language the mind can grasp.  \n\nAnd perhaps, just perhaps, they will find the answer.",
            "The death of infants and newborns in this land of Java and Sumatra, it has hung steady these last ten years.  The country aims for the promised moons of those Millennium Declarations, clean water and the like, but the children and their mothers, they fall short.  The reasons for this failing are many, and lie not in the programs themselves, but in the bones of the system.\n\nThey boast of births attended by learned hands, 72% they say, but these hands are not always of the doctor. Midwives, women of the village, they attend, but no knife to staunch a hemorrhage, no scales to weigh the fading life.  So the mothers bleed out, a silent toll.\n\nThe children, too, they suffer.  Diarrhea, a scourge of the young, treated less and less by those with skill.  And the care after birth, a shadow, a whisper, lacking for the mother and child alike.\n\nThe steel cuts, the cesarean, a rare thing here.  4% maybe, a whisper compared to the cities where it's 7%.  The knife, a luxury for the city dweller, a phantom for the farmer.  And the poor, they are forgotten, the line between rich and poor a chasm.  27%, they say, the difference in care.  The cost of healing, a wall too high for them to climb.\n\nSo what then, the question hangs, a shroud over the land.  Programs, they offer, quick fixes, but at what cost?  One hand reaches for the child, the other forgets the mother.  Resources diverted, like ants swarming a dropped crumb, leaving the rest to wither.",
            "The Victorian age, a time of suffocating detail and endless pronouncements on the station of the titled. Yet even in that gilded cage, shadows stirred.  Two novels, *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, claw at the edges of this tradition, venturing into the realm of the uncanny. Both weave a tapestry of mystery, a hint of the perverse, a dissonance that resonates through the characters, illuminating their motives, their buried grief.  \n\nConsider this passage from Dickens: \n\n>“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nA fever dream, a descent into chaos. These novels, they use this disquiet often, in dreams, in visions, though the purpose shifts with each turn. In *Oliver Twist*, these phantoms delve into the boy's own wounded soul, revealing the ache within, the recognition of a world turned cruel. When the shooting finally returns, in chapter 28, it's a reliving, a reenactment, as if through a fogged glass.  He seeks help, but the world spins, the hand of fate a cold, unseen thing.  The senses are numb, the pain a constant ache, a companion to the fear.  Whose will brought this down upon him? Not his own, not in this maelstrom. A sense of defeat creeps in, a hardening of the spirit, as if Fagin's darkness has begun to seep into him, a poison that numbs the will to resist.\n\nAnd again, from *Wuthering Heights*:\n\n>“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "Two years back I was working the after-school shift, tutoring the small ones. English and reading, that's where my own light shone brightest. They sent me a boy named Adrian. Third or fourth grade, maybe. Trouble reading, he was.  Something off about it, the way he struggled. Some letters, clear as day. Others, not a lick of sense. Like a broken clock, telling different times.  He spoke English right good, this boy, though. Latino, that much was plain. \n\nThen came the day I was left holding the fort while the rest of the kids were gone on some outing. Adrian's mother walked in. Not a word of English passed her lips, just Spanish. My own Spanish, well, it was threadbare, a learner's tongue. But we managed. Then it hit me, like a stone dropped from a height. Adrian, he could read fine. It was just the alphabet he didn't know.  English letters, strange to him. Don't know if it helped much, but I hope the boy's doing better now. \n\nI tell this story, because the language gap in these schools, it's a damn canyon.  Especially here in California. And it ain't always so clear cut. A kid speaking English perfect might still struggle. Reading, it can be a hard birth. \n\nAdrian, his problem was simple:  English reading, the alphabet, the sounds.  But for the kids barely speaking English, it's a heavier load. No single answer, no magic bullet. Dual language, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of it solves it alone.  It takes everything, all mixed together.\n\nDual language, it ain't just for Spanish speakers. For all the kids. They say it's a waste, that it won't help the majority. Lies. Make it the rule, not the exception, and everyone benefits. But how? Every teacher bilingual? Unrealistic.  But maybe, just maybe, some helpers, aides, whatever you call 'em, who speak both tongues.",
            "The world tells you from the start there's somethin' bigger. Somethin' vast. Unreckonable. They send you to pews or temples or they tell you to find it in the dark corners of your own skull. Most swallow it whole, the stories passed down like worn rosary beads. But some, they spit it out.  Say there's nothin' but the skin of your own world.  They build their own gods, their own cages.  And the path? It twists and turns, searchin' for some light in the goddamn dark. \n\n\"A cardinal,\" my pa said, when I asked him what bird he liked best. We were on the porch, rain drummin' on the tin roof, stink of wet earth and smoke in the air.  He was lookin' out at the water runnin' from the gutters, drownin' the plants.  His eyes, they were lost, half-rememberin', half-searchin'.  He'd thinned out, his clothes hangin' like rags.  Hair scraggly, like the last tendrils of a winter storm. He didn't look at me. Couldn't.  I felt it, the lonesome pull, the fear. Couldn't speak it, not out loud.  'Cause sayin' it would make it real. So I hugged him, pulled my chair closer, and watched the rain with him, the sky bleedin' purple and gray.\n\nHe died in December, five days after my twenty-second year.  Chemo and radiation, they kept him breathin', but nothin' eased the burnin'.  A few more months, they said.  What good that was, I couldn't say.  What kind of God would do that?  Layin' there in the dark, no prayers came. If He was listenin', He stopped a long time ago.\n\nDidn't want to watch him go.  Didn't want to see the light fade from his eyes.  Wanted to hold him in the way he was, not the way he wasn't.  Knew him better than anyone else.  He wouldn't have wanted me there, watchin' the end.  Curled up tight in my bed, waitin' for the news.\n\nThey didn't call.",
            "The Gothic, a name that sings of contradiction, an oxymoron for \"Old-New\" as Watt declared. Praised and damned, mocked and lauded for its glimpse of the terrible sublime -  a dance with darkness. Walpole, he who birthed the beast with his *Castle of Otranto*, wove threads of ancient romance and the newfangled novel. An echo of the stage, a mimicry of nature, a \"Gothic Story,\" he called it.  He drew upon the bones of Gothic theatre, its architecture, its lore. A tattered word, \"Gothic,\" flung against epochs and peoples, marked archaic, unsophisticated. Yet, in its shadow, a new light flickered. The intimacy of the novel, the peering into the soul of man, gave the Gothic a strange life, a timeless resonance. \n\nAnd from the ashes of chivalry arose a specter. The medieval knight, brave, honorable, competent, a fading ideal in the eyes of the writers, especially Walpole. They saw a world gone soft, a world lacking the steel of the past. Chivalry, they held, was the cure, a balm for the wounds of modernity.  The \"gothic past\" shimmered, romanticized, a promise of what might have been. Walpole, caught in the maelstrom of politics, a man unjustly accused, saw this decay. Did he yearn for a simpler time, for the supposed virtue of a bygone age? \n\nFrederic, his prince, a figure sculpted from chivalric dreams. He was a prince, yes, marked by suffering, touched by tragedy. \"Gallant,\" \"courteous,\" a knight raised to an impossible height, a trope echoing through the ages. An exaggeration, a hint of the Gothic excess to come.",
            "The movement of goods, a river of commerce, flows from the customer's want to the raw earth itself. From there it spills through the channels of supply, production, and distribution, finally reaching the waiting hands of its maker. This river, this chain, was given its name in the year of '82 by a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant who saw the need for order in the chaos. He spoke of planning, of wielding control over this flow, of making it swift and sure, all to satisfy the hunger of the customer.  \n\nSix pillars hold this chain aloft. Production, supply, the hoard of inventory, the choice of place, the rumble of transport, and the whispers of information.  These are the tools the manager wields, shaping the river to serve the needs of the consumer.\n\nProduction, the first and most vital link. Here the ground is broken, the earth yielded. It is the heart of the chain, beating with the rhythm of want and need. The manager must know what the customer desires, what whispers on the wind of the marketplace. The market, a vast and shifting sea, holds the answers. Through its currents, the manager discerns the demands, the call for this or that.  Then comes the decision: what shall be made, and in what quantity? The manager, with a keen eye, chooses the place of creation, the factory that will best serve both volume and quality, the place where the river will flow truest.  Finally, the manager sets the pace of work, the maintenance of the machinery, for every detail here is etched in stone, every misstep a cost in time and coin. For I have seen the wheels grind to a halt, the river choked, in the face of carelessness.\n\nSupply, the second pillar. It speaks of strategy, of forging alliances and choosing partners. A single product may have many faces, many divisions, each with its own tools, its own workers, its own mastery. The manager must decide where each piece fits, where each thread is woven. And sometimes, the manager chooses to yield, to outsource, to let another hand shape the clay. This is done for velocity, for the swiftness with which goods are made and delivered, for the flexibility to adapt, and for the ever-present need to keep the cost low, the river flowing clear.",
            "The sign, a scrap of cardboard held aloft, spoke of things best left unsaid.  \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it declared in a scrawling hand, the ink bleeding into the fibers like a dying man's blood.  Ellen Page, face pale and drawn under the harsh glare of the streetlamps, stood alone.  \n\nBurma. A place name that tasted of dust and sorrow. A land ruled by men with iron fists and eyes as black as the crows that circled above the jade-green rice paddies. A junta, they called them, these men who seized power in a whirlwind of bullets and betrayal. Since '62, the year the world shifted on its axis, Burma had been a country choked by silence. Until the Saffron Revolution. Monks, their robes the color of dying embers, rose up, their chanting a challenge to the storm clouds gathering over the land.  \n\nThe government, a viper coiled in its own poison, allowed the protests at first, a cruel amusement. But the whispers grew louder, the crowds swelled. The viper struck. Monasteries, havens of peace, were overrun, their sacred halls echoing with the cries of the fallen. Foreign eyes, seeking the truth, were dragged into the darkness, their lenses forever capturing the horror. Kenji Nagai, a man who dared to witness, paid the ultimate price. \n\nOne thousand, they said. Three thousand, whispered the wind. But the Colonel, a shadow escaping the viper's coils, spoke of a number too terrible to utter. \n\nThis, this was not new. The hunger for power, the thirst for control, it was a disease that festered in the heart of men. The Caesars, draped in their purple robes, claimed to be chosen by the gods, their will absolute. The emperors of Japan, shrouded in myth and whispered prayers, believed themselves divine. And here, in the land of the free, a man named Bush, his face a mask of piety, sought counsel from a man called Haggard, a shepherd of souls steeped in the darkness of the abyss.  \n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity yearning for freedom, met with the cold steel of tanks. June 4th, a date etched in blood. The official count, a lie whispered by the wind. In Rwanda, the jungle ran red with the blood of innocents, the cries of the slaughtered swallowed by the silence of the world. And the Third Reich, a testament to the depths of human depravity, where the stench of death lingered long after the ashes had settled.  \n\nThe world, a tapestry woven with threads of light and darkness, turned its gaze away. But the truth, like a wound that never heals, remained.",
            "Duke Ellington. A name that hangs heavy in the air of jazz. His legacy's woven from the thread of years, spun long and taut. It's in the shaping of his orchestra, his hand upon the keys a whisper, a guide. His compositions, they breathe with a richness, a complexity, showcasing the bones and sinew of each man in the band.  \n\nHe built a framework, a cage of sound where souls could soar, improvise.  Tightly woven phrases, orchestrated, demanding the particular grace of each player, each note a brushstroke on a canvas of sound.  He coaxed the tone of the whole, birthing something new, something singular. A testament to the music itself.\n\nThe Grove, that book of hushed pronouncements, speaks of Ellington's sound, his daring. \"Creole Love Call,\" they say, using the voice as an instrument. A threadbare blues, twelve bars, six choruses, each one a different shade of the same sorrow. The voice, it starts smooth, a lover's caress, then rasps, a plea from the abyss. The trumpet, muted, a sigh, a lament, reaching for notes beyond the ordinary. The clarinet, a cry, soaring, lost in a sea of syncopated piano. The brass, the reeds, they echo, they answer.  A crescendo, a final chorus, a voice now a growl, a beast unleashed. A trombone, a final discordant wail, a question unanswered.\n\nAnd the voice, always the voice. A color, a texture, a thing apart. A tool, a weapon, a mirror held up to the soul. This is Ellington's voice, his touch, his lasting legacy. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" the trumpet and the scat, a conversation in tongues. A dance between instrument and voice, each borrowing from the other, a tapestry of sound. And in \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" the trombone, a mournful cry, introducing the melody, a single voice in a wilderness of sound.",
            "The need had always been there. A gnawing, unfillable thing. It began when she was fourteen, a girl on the cusp, and had followed her into the hollow of seventeen. Now she knew it wasn't a thing she craved, but someone. Yet no boy had stirred within her the faintest flicker of interest. Some had tried, stumbling through the clumsy rites of courtship, but they were all strangers, passing shadows.  She questioned herself often, this emptiness a vast and echoing canyon of her own making. Theories formed and dissolved like mist. Nothing concrete, nothing that could satiate the ache. So she lived, adrift in a sea of unanswered questions.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet. Her parents, good people, lived in a rhythm of gentle calm. Their words were seldom sharp, their voices never raised. They argued, rarely, only over her insistence on charting her own course, her vibrant spirit a counterpoint to their measured lives. She was their daughter, yet she was a storm in their stillness, a bright flame in their quiet hearth.\n\nBut today, the air hung thick and heavy. As she wandered, searching for inspiration, a cry tore through the stillness. Her mother's voice, thin and sharp as broken glass. Panic seized her. \"Mom? What is it?\"\n\nShe found her mother sprawled on the kitchen floor, her face etched with pain. \"Ow,\" she gasped, each word a shard of agony. \n\nHer daughter knelt beside her, a hand trembling on her mother's arm. \"Sweetheart, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were squeezed out, each syllable a battle.\n\n\"Okay, Mom,\" she said, her voice tight. \"Where should I meet you?\"\n\nHer mother pointed, her hand trembling. Relief washed over her daughter, gratitude for the strength she had built. She lifted her mother, careful, sure, and carried her to the car. \n\nThe hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear. But fear was a distant whisper compared to the urgency that pulsed through her. She carried her mother inside, her voice a desperate plea for help. \n\nDoctors materialized, faces creased with concern. A gurney appeared, a silent promise of care. They took her mother away, leaving her daughter adrift in a sea of worry.\n\nThe truth, when it came, was simple. A stepping stool, a vase too high, a moment of clumsy grace. It could have been worse.",
            "This study, a reckoning with the ways of heart and blood, sought to prove the claim: that a life lived by the tenets of the Mediterranean Diet, as measured by a score given to the adherence, the so-called 'alternate Mediterranean' or aMed score, would stave off the cruel grip of chronic heart disease and the sudden stroke. This aMed way, a variant of the older Mediterranean ways, calls for the bounty of the earth: plants in their fullness, proteins from the soil and the tree, fat from the olive and the nut, fish from the deep. It calls for a measured hand with animal flesh and the fats that clog the vessels. And it allows, sparingly, for the comfort of wine.\n\nOld studies, like whispers in the wind, had spoken of a link between the Mediterranean way and a lessening of heart's peril, both in life and in death. One trial, a controlled test of will, showed the Mediterranean way more potent than a diet of meagerness in shedding weight and clearing the blood's pathways. But these whispers had not addressed the specter of stroke, nor the shadow of its passing.\n\nThis study, a vigil over seventy-four thousand women, their years between thirty-eight and sixty-three, followed them through two decades, from 1984 to 2004. These women, nurses in the service of health, were part of a larger cohort, a thousand souls strong, scattered across eleven states. Six times, the researchers measured their adherence to the aMed ways through written accounts of their meals, these 'food frequency questionnaires' or FFQs. Over ninety-five percent of these women kept to their pact, their records a testament to their commitment. These accounts, scrutinized and tested, were cross-referenced with the cold records of hospitals and death certificates, seeking truth in the face of mortality.\n\nThe researchers, seeking to banish the ghosts of chance, averaged the aMed scores, smoothing out the peaks and valleys of individual variation. They adjusted for the shadows that could skew the results: age, the habit of smoke, the weight of the body, the state of womanhood, the use of hormones, the intake of vitamins, the solace of wine, the rhythm of physical activity, and the shield of aspirin.\n\nThen, with the tools of statistics, they measured the link between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models to dissect the fatal and the non-fatal.\n\nThe findings were clear: those who lived closer to the aMed ways, with higher scores, faced a lower risk of these afflictions.  Over twenty years, the researchers catalogued a thousand deaths from heart disease, a thousand strokes, and over a thousand deaths from these combined evils. The women at the pinnacle of the aMed scale stood a third less likely to suffer these fates compared to those at the bottom.",
            "The year was two thousand and seven. The bones of the American dream had begun to rattle. A sickness had taken hold, spreading through the veins of the nation. Banks, bloated and gorged on easy credit, stood stripped bare. Houses, once symbols of prosperity, now stood vacant, monuments to a folly. The weight of debt, a shroud, settled upon the land.\n\nThey say it was a storm brewing for years. The whispers began in the Clinton years, when the promise of easy money and a second term twisted the hand of policy. Lending was loosened, a reckless act that loosened the very fabric of the financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, twin pillars of the housing market, were pressured to repackage these risky loans, churning them into securities and selling them off like poisoned fruit.\n\nThe market, drunk on greed, swallowed them whole. But the hangover came swift and brutal. When the piper demanded payment, the borrowers were gone, vanished like smoke in the wind. The banks, hollowed out, had no cushion, no backstop. The rot spread, consuming the very heart of the economy. Lehman Brothers, a titan of finance, crumbled to dust. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold off in fire sales. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, their faces pallid with fear, were forced to bend the knee to the government.\n\nThe scars remain. A generation scarred by a crisis born of hubris and avarice. And the question lingers, a bitter taste in the mouth: What lessons were learned? Were any? Or will we, like moths to a flame, be drawn to the same folly once more?",
            "Ah, exposition. The place in the telling where the writer stretches his wings, or maybe just flaps them a while before the wind catches him up and carries him away. Or  maybe he just falls out of the sky.  Dr. Merlin, she's been known to let out a howl at the screen when she finds herself drowning in too much of the telling. Not the good kind of drowning, neither.\n\nExposition ain't your friend.\n\nThey say, show, don't tell. But Dr. Merlin, she still stumbles into these long stretches of words where nothin' happens, or worse, too much. Like a hound dog baying at the moon. Exposition, it's that devil on your shoulder whispering to get it all out in the open, get the past laid bare, before you get to the good parts. Don't get me wrong, the other devil whispers too, the one urging you to lay out every detail of every life, every scar and every dream.\n\nExposition, it's the author doing the telling. Like a sailor reciting a long ballad, the old mariners' tale, pouring out the whole damn history. In a story, it's the author's voice that drowns you in it.\n\nTake for instance, a story you're reading. You're told the heroine met her man, they wed with a flourish, and then he's gone, murdered right before her eyes. You ain't gonna want to read two pages of that, are you? Two whole pages of telling, with nothin' but two lines of dialogue from each character.\n\nYou want to see the husband, feel him, hear his words, see the love in his eyes. You want to see how the heroine changes when he comes into her life, how she blossoms under his gaze.  Show me the man, show me the woman, and then show me the tragedy.\n\nGive me meat on the bone, that's what I'm saying. Show me the man, show me the woman, and show me the bone they're both hung on.\n\nThere's a temptation to rush past things. You got a new character, maybe he was in the Air Force, now he pumps gas at night, twice-married, no kids, fishes on weekends. He dreams of owning the station someday. Ate Eggs Benedict for breakfast. That's a whole life right there, but you gotta show me, don't just tell me.",
            "The flickering screen coughed up two dispatches from Columbus. First, NBC 4, their faces pale and strained, spoke of a man named Shad Hostettler, a shadow cast in a mug shot, and his deeds in Ashley. A wife, nameless, stabbed multiple times. Two minutes, maybe, before they moved on. Evil, plain as day in his eyes. \n\nThen, a whisper of a story. Travis Buyers, eighteen, shot in the woods. No arrests, no names. The SWAT Team prowled. The briefness of it stung.  Black boy, shot down. A familiar ache. They don't linger on these things, not like the white boy missing, the white girl snatched.  \n\nThe Med-Flight chopper, a hole in its side, a .22 rifle bullet. A whisper of five thousand dollars for whispers. \n\nThunder promised, the weekend hot. A tease.  \n\nA robbery, a UDF on Clime Road. A man, dark-skinned, a hoodie pulled low. Six feet, a hundred and fifty pounds.  They lingered on the darkness of his skin, a stain.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a name from Texas, a kingpin of weed.  Three hundred months they said. Not twenty-five years, no. Three hundred.  Hispanic, they added, though the words felt misplaced.",
            "The tie between brothers. It's a thing woven deep, unyielding. A tangled skein of feeling: love, pride, envy, the dark blood of malice. They know each other like the lines on their own hand. See themselves looking back, a ghost in the mirror. This bond it shows its face in the dark, in the teeth of the storm. Good or bad.  The price you pay for knowing these things, the weight of it all, that's the burden. To see your own face in your brother's eyes, not the mask you show the world, but the raw truth, the bone beneath. In that looking glass, in the deeds and the dust they leave behind, lies the man. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk this path, a journey etched against the green and humid air.  A boy and his brother, bound together by blood and shadow. Pride, bitter and sharp, and the sun-soaked ache of love, clash in the end. Only one walks away from the wreckage. The story tells it through the voice of the boy, the brother who walks the tightrope between light and dark. His words paint the world and the boy  with the scarlet ibis, both dying things, both beautiful in their fragility. \n\nThe boy, he's driven by pride, a hunger in his soul. From the first time they walk together, through the swamp and the sun-drenched fields, he sees not a brother, but a reflection of his own desires. He wants a brother to match his steps, to run and climb, to share the secrets of the world. He wants a brother who can keep pace. But Doodle, he's different. Born weak, a fragile bird with a heart that struggles to beat.  The boy's dreams, they shatter like glass. He feels anger, a dark bloom in his chest. He thinks of ending it all, of smothering the boy in the night. But then, a smile. A flicker of light in the darkness. The boy, he hesitates. Maybe the love, maybe the blood, maybe something in the boy's eyes, it keeps him from the edge.",
            "The mind, a dark and tangled thicket. Men have tried to chart its depths with metaphors, first a blank slate, then a scroll, a book, and now, this cold, metallic notion of a machine. But these are but shadows cast on a wall.  \n\nInput. The senses bleed into the world, a flood of heat and light and sound, transmuted into whispers the brain can understand. These signals, they weave through circuits, a tapestry of bottom-up and top-down, like threads pulled tight and then slack. See a box, black against white. The brain stitches together edges, color, shape, a simple picture made whole. But then, the shadows speak. Is it a box, or a void, a hole in the white? The mind knows. It sifts and sorts.\n\nAttention, a fragile thing, a spotlight in the dark. It chooses what to hold fast, what to let drift away. A field of grass, a blur beneath the feet. A name spoken, a sudden clarity. The mind filters, a sieve in the storm.\n\nMemory, a whisper in the wind. Sensory echoes, fleeting as a breath. Working memory, a flickering flame, a loop of light in the neural dark. Long-term, a stone archway, carved from the very fabric of being. Words, they etch themselves into the mind, structural, sonic, and meaning.\n\nKnowledge, a spider web spun across the brain. Connections, fragile and strong, a web of meaning. A chair, a table, wood. The mind weaves, a tapestry of thought, a mirror reflecting the world and its own shadowy depths.",
            "The world Huxley paints in *Brave New World* is a bleached canvas, airbrushed clean of individuality. Technology, a gleaming blade, cuts down the forest of the human spirit. And what remains? A hollow, echoing chamber of consumerism, enforced by a gilded cage of capital.\n\nCommunity, they say. But it's a community of the lobotomized, their minds pre-programmed to chase the phantoms of instant gratification. They are the pawns, dancing to the tune of the World Controller, their strings pulled by the unseen hand of a system built on illusion.\n\nThe echoes of Marx whisper through the pages. Homogeny, reification, these are the tools of the master, shaping the worker into a cog in the machine. Huxley, through his keen eye, sees the tendrils of this new economy wrapping tight around the human soul.\n\nHe calls it false consciousness. The masses, blinded by their own desires, are kept ignorant of the true relations of power. They chase trinkets and pleasures, their minds numbed by the hypnotic hum of consumption. The Delta, the Gamma, they are the shadows, dancing to the tune of the World Controller's flute. \n\nHegemony, a suffocating shroud, blankets the world. The upper classes, born into their gilded cages, see the truth but choose to remain complicit. They are the shepherds, guiding the flock to the slaughterhouse of their own contentment.  \n\nAnd love? That flickering flame of the human heart is extinguished in this sterile landscape. Relationships are transactional, devoid of depth or meaning.  Men speak of women in terms of their physical attributes, like machines to be used and discarded. \n\nHuxley's world is a warning. A glimpse into a future where technology and capitalism, unchecked, will leave us hollow shells, our souls devoured by the insatiable maw of the system.",
            "The stone walls of these halls had held me for two and a half years, four and a half semesters. Getting ‘round this place, it was a chore like hauling water up a dry well. Freshman year, they stuck me in the East Halls, out past the stadium, past the Jordan Center, near the edge of the world. Willard Building. To get there, from that godforsaken corner, it took a good twenty minutes, feet eatin’ up the asphalt. Sometimes more. Especially when the sky opened up and the rain came down like a fist. \n\nAn old boy, not much older than myself, told me about a time when those halls were islands, surrounded by nothing but empty fields. Now, the fields were gone, swallowed by fresh brick and mortar. The Creamery, the health center, a whole new sprawl of sports fields. The campus, it kept growin’, reachin’ and stretchin’, makin’ the journey from here to there a test of endurance.\n\nHe said, \"Bikes are the answer.\" A silent, hard truth. But the answer ain’t in the bike itself. It’s in the ridin’.  It’s in buildin’ a place where the wheels can turn freely.\n\nMy friend, he’d been off the saddle for years, but he’d found his way back. \"Why ever did I stop?\" he’d said. \"Bikes, they keep you alive.\" They keep you movin’, keep you seein’.\n\nThirty miles on a bowl of oatmeal and a little sweat. That’s how a man lives.\n\nI live out here now, off the land, just as far from the center as some of those dorms. Best damn move I made was buyin’ a bike. Class down in Thomas Building. Twenty-five minutes on foot. Five on two wheels. \n\nBut Pollock Road… it’s a hard road, no matter how fast you spin.\n\nWalkin’, it’s got its own merits. But time, it’s a thief. And I ain’t got none to spare. Two and a half hours a week, that’s what walkin’ would cost me. Add to that the other trips, the errands, the endless to and fro.\n\nBikes, they keep you movin’. They keep you free."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson.

Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The boy sat there on the worn couch, a sixteen-year-old ghost in the dim light. His friend had eased him in, spoken of troubles at home, of parents who wielded a hammer instead of a touch.  The next day, news came. The boy had called the law. I drove out to the house, a wisp of a hope stirring in my chest. A psychology degree, I thought, maybe that could help. I spoke to the law, spoke to the parents, their faces tight with a kind of practiced fear. \"Manipulative,\" they called him, their words thin and brittle.  He was a boy trying to breathe, and they were choking him. That's when it became clear.  Social work. This was the path. \n\nThere's a hollowness in a society that claims to value the individual while churning them out in identical molds.  We mourn the broken, yet we celebrate conformity. I've never been one for fitting in.  From the unnatural hues in my hair to the piercings that defied convention, from the quiet stand against injustice to the fight for those silenced, I've always sought to carve my own space.

            "The paper concerns itself with the twin shadows of insomnia, the biological and sociocultural. The biological leans towards the hardwired, the genes inherited, the body's mechanics. It seeks the source of sleeplessness in the very marrow. The sociocultural, it casts a wider net, examining the world's pull on the mind, the threads woven through race, class, and circumstance. This review seeks to unravel both these threads, to trace the paths of research that illuminate these models, to weigh their findings against the anvil of reality. \n\nSleeplessness takes many forms. Primary, where the roots lie solely within the self. Dyssomnias, the disorders of sleep itself, where the body rebels against its call. Or Parasomnias, where the sleep landscape is twisted, dreams bleeding into waking hours. Then there are the disorders born of other ailments, mental or physical, or the poison of substance. Primary Insomnia, the inability to find rest, Primary Hypersomnia, the weight of endless slumber. Narcolepsy, the thief of control, stealing the body's strength, leaving it trembling in the wake of sleep's embrace.  \n\nThe biological model whispers of neurons, of the hypothalamus, the orexin, the conductor of sleep and wakefulness. This study, it delves into the brains of mice, their GABAB receptors, keys that unlock the gates of slumber. A flick of the switch, a manipulation of these receptors, and sleep emerges, a tide receding and returning. \n\nBut the question remains: can we extrapolate these findings to the human condition? Is this mouse a mirror held to our own souls? If so, what does it tell us?  A flaw in this receptor, a genetic quirk, could leave a man adrift in a sea of sleepless nights. And the sociocultural echoes? If this predisposition is inherited, it paints a grim picture. A child born into a world where sleep eludes them, a burden passed down through generations, hindering their every waking moment. School, work, the mundane tasks of life, all become poisoned by sleeplessness, a constant struggle against the tide.",
            "The paper leans into three reckonings of what they call Central Auditory Processing Disorder, CAPD. \n\nFirst, a sketch of the thing itself. Then, the ways of knowing if it's there, the telltale signs. And finally, how a teacher in a room full of sound might help a child who bears this weight.\n\nCAPD, or APD, they say it's a matter of how the mind makes sense of what the ears hear. The brain, the central nervous system, can't quite do its job right. The sound gets there, clear enough, but the switching, the sorting, the making of meaning, it falters. The ears ain't the problem, it's what comes after. The soul of the hearing, they say. \n\nThey first whispered about this in the fifties, 'auditory imperception' was the name then.  Kids with troubles speaking, they thought something was amiss. Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari, testing the children in Italy. Kimura, in '61, spoke of dichotic testing, the way the brain splits the sound world.  A conference in '77, a gathering of minds, and the talk turned to this thing, this CAPD.\n\nThe signs, they come in many forms. Sound, it may not be heard right, lost in the spaces between. Words, they may blend together, indistinguishable. Patterns, unseen. Sarcasm, a change in tone, lost on the ear. One sound buries the next.  The mind, it can't weave the threads of sound into a tapestry of meaning.\n\nTo find it, they observe, they test.  Audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, they all have their tools. Questionnaires, observations, sounds presented and responses measured. No single test, no surefire sign. The cause, a mystery.  Some tests, they bombard the ears with noise, see if the mind can pick out the signal. Others, they measure the echoes within the ear, the brain's own whispers.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night. It speaks to the nature of disguise, how it can serve a purpose, a dark purpose, but how in the end it eats away at a man, a woman, a soul. To shed the mask, to reveal the face beneath, that is a risk. A risk of exile, of being cast out by those who knew you only in the shadows. \n\nThe question then becomes one of choice. To preserve the self, or the fragile threads of connection that bind us to others. Some will turn away from the truth, others will bear it like a wound. And the deception of gender, that is a wound that cuts deep. Why would anyone seek to become another? To hide in the skin of the opposite? That is the question Viola wrestles with, driven by a need for survival.  \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" she says. A foreign land, a perilous journey, and the weight of her own identity cast off like a discarded coat. But the disguise takes hold, alienating her from her own kind, severing the bonds of sisterhood. \n\nAnd then there is the confusion, the tangled web of desire. Olivia, caught in the snare of Viola's fabricated masculinity, falls for the phantom, calling her \"husband.\" Orsino, the Duke, consumed by his own melancholia, finds himself drawn to the charade, confessing his love for the boy Cesario. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nThis play, it speaks of hidden desires, unveiled by the artifice. Does Olivia truly yearn for men, or does she mistake the mask for the man? Or is it a mockery of her own society, a reflection of their shallow judgments?  The truth lies somewhere in the shadows, obscured by the play's own ambiguity. Olivia, she moves from Cesario to Sebastian with a swiftness that suggests a heart easily swayed. And Viola, stripped of her disguise, is embraced as a sister, not a lover. The mask removed, the truth revealed. But at what cost?",
            "The shadow of empire fell heavy on the land. German, they called it. Brutality, a word whispered in the dust, etched in the bones of the Ovaherero, the Nama. Genocide, a stain on the sun-bleached plains of South West Africa. But empire, like the land itself, was a vast and varied thing. Policies, like the shifting sands, flowed in different currents.  Education, too, wore many faces.  East Africa, Tanganyika, taken by the British under a different sky, held a people literate, educated, their minds touched by the German hand.  Kamerun, too, bore witness to such endeavors.\n\nBut South West Africa, a land of stark contrasts, held a different story.  Here, the state, the iron fist of government, did not reach out to the native.  The task of instruction, of shaping young minds, fell to the missionaries, their churches echoing with hymns and prayers, their schools a refuge, a lifeline.  Limited, meager, the government’s support. Yet, the Europeans, the settlers who carved their names on the landscape, they were different.  State schools rose for them, their education nurtured, their futures assured.\n\nThe legacy of these policies, like the ghosts of the past, lingered. While East Africa boasted a literate citizenry, South West Africa remained cloaked in ignorance.  A vast majority, untouched, uneducated, their words lost in the wind.  What forces, what unseen hands, shaped this divergence? This paper seeks to delve into the hearts of the settlers, into the minds of the authorities, to uncover the reasons, the justifications, the justifications…\n\nThe books speak of this, written in tongues of German and English, their pages filled with narratives of education, of systems, of comparisons.  Cohen, a scholar, a seeker of truth, he wrote of South West Africa, of East Africa, drawing parallels, illuminating the differences.  He saw in the settler population, the driving force behind the divide.  \n\nSouth West Africa, a land of temperate climes, a land where even the desert held a certain beauty, it attracted the Europeans.  In 1913, nearly fifteen thousand of them walked its soil, more than any other colony save East Africa.",
            "Popular music, a sprawling, tangled thing, has grown beyond counting in these last hundred years. Genres, like roots spreading, creep and intertwine. The names alone - rap, rock, country, jazz, folk - whisper of a multitude. And within each, a thicket of subgenres, deeper still, branching out like veins in a corpse. Heavy metal, that brooding child of rock, has become a world unto itself in the last four decades. A world of noise and fury, expressing the dark corners of the soul. It ain't pretty, but it's honest. Diversified, too. Bands took the raw materials, twisted and turned them, birthing subgenres that spawned sub-subgenres, and so on, a fractal of sound echoing out into the night.\n\nNow, the metal beast has grown so vast, so many heads, it's hard to say what it truly is. It's absorbed threads from every other genre, a chameleon of sound. But every beast has a genesis. To understand the metal that bleeds out of every speaker, you gotta dig down, find that first spark. Metal ain't just a genre. It's a movement, a force of nature.\n\nDarkness is its creed. More bass, more volume, more violence. Less innocence, more goddamn skill. Metal musicians, they know their instruments like they know their own bones. And like a fever dream, it's fueled by the haze. The psychedelic boom of the seventies, it turned minds to acid, spewing forth music that was wild and strange. It was a soundtrack to the apocalypse, a reflection of the world fracturing around them. Visceral, raw, honest. Something new in a world of polished pop. And the ghosts of Romanticism, they whisper in the shadows, their darkness echoing through the decades. \n\nLyrics like these, they speak to the heart of it:\n\n*Helter Skelter*\n\nThe Beatles, they  wrote it, a glimpse into the darkness that lurked beneath the surface. A spiral, a descent, the highs and lows of a drug-fueled journey. Some say it's the first metal song, a challenge to the Stones, a declaration of their own darkness.",
            "The Surrealists, they came along later, with their strange visions of dreamscapes. But before them, there was Rousseau, painting his own dreams, real as the brushstrokes themselves. The Dream, 1910, a canvas thick with his longing. Not just a woman lost in wonder, but Rousseau’s own heart laid bare. He dreamed of being seen, of the brushstrokes earning their keep, of the whispers in polite art circles. But the world, it was a hard place. To be accepted, to be deemed worthy, did he have to mimic the ghosts of masters past? Or carve his own path, a lonely road under an unforgiving sun?\n\nThe Dream, it holds the answer, or at least a piece of it. To understand it, you gotta know his story. Born in Laval, a small town in the north, to a tinsmith with a taste for comfort. No schooling in the fine arts, just the toll booths and the dust of the road, a gabelou, they called him. Douanier, the customs man, a name he wore like a borrowed coat.  His first wife, Clémence, vanished with eight children, leaving him with a daughter, Julia, and a grief that tasted like ash. Painting, it became his refuge, his way to stitch together the torn edges of his soul.\n\nHe wasn't like the other painters, those who romanticized the peasant life. Rousseau was the peasant, his canvas a reflection of their hopes and dreams. \n\nHe hungered for acceptance, and no wonder. He started late, with no guidance, a voice crying out in a wilderness of talent. Matisse, he was already making a name, while Rousseau toiled in the shadows. To be admitted to the Artiste Français, he thought, he had to paint what they wanted, what was expected.\n\n“Matisse, he feared the ordinary,” wrote Jan Gordon, a chronicler of the age, “but Rousseau yearned for it, for a way in.”",
            "The notion of a kinship 'tween ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty, has been pondered by many a thinker. A reason, I believe, lies at the heart of it. As Keats writes, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we grasp in this life comes from the books we read or the roads we walk. Yet, ethics and aesthetics, like Keats suggests, seem to take root in us without the hand of instruction. Both are more a matter of describing than dictating. Our study of right and wrong, of beauty, is largely an attempt to unravel the why—why a canvas sings, why an act aligns with the moral compass. Not a rulebook for judgment or creation, mind you.\n\nCriticism, be it of art or morals, can never fully grasp the essence of what's good or what's beautiful. Talk of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might delve into foreground, background, contrast, the weight of history. But these things, they don't tell the whole story. When asked about a cherished work, a piece of writing that lingers, you'll often hear, \"There's just something about it,\" before the words stumble to explain. Art and morals, I reckon, they can't be fully pinned down. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way ... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how sharp the description, something transcendent remains. Ethics, I believe, has this same quality. Wittgenstein, he wrote, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It's this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, that gives art and morality their power, their connection to something beyond.\n\nMorality and art, they bind us because we experience them, not with our minds alone, but with a deeper knowing, a noumenal sense.  Literature, with its words that bleed into the soul, is especially potent. As McKean put it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The Germany of now, a fortress nation. Strong. Bound by a blood-forged culture, from the shadow of the Alps in München to the damp stones of Kiel on the Baltic.  From Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of the land, to Dresden, a city carved from stone on the Elbe. A tapestry woven from threads of many tongues and traditions. It's no wonder, then, that this Germany, this entity, sprang not from a single seed but from a confluence of tribes, of bloodlines tangled in the mists of time.\n\nGermania. The name itself, a whisper from the past, a bone thrown to the dogs of history. Its meaning, a battlefield of scholars' ink. Tacitus, that grim chronicler, claimed it hailed from the Tungrians, a tribe that once roamed these lands before the Rhine became their battleground. A name they wore like a shield against the Gauls. Caesar, that ravenous Caesar, first etched \"Germanus\" into his annals, a word borrowed from the conquered Gauls to separate foe from friend. A distinction drawn in blood. Some say it echoed a word from the Gaulish tongue, a neighbor's name. Caesar himself, in his first chapter on the Gallic Wars, writes of these men, \"Germans... who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"\n\nOthers whisper of a different origin. A spear, the \"ger,\" wielded by these warriors. Or perhaps from the Old Irish \"garim,\" a shout, a challenge, a roar that echoed across the plains. A testament to a people who spoke loud and lived loud. \n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 testament, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" paints a picture of a people untouched, unadulterated. \"I should regard them (the Germans) as aboriginal,\" he writes, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" A land they held sacred,  \"a wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect.\" A land that repelled the Romans, those who sought to carve their own empire from the world.\n\nThey came to its borders, these Romans, driven by greed for its treasures. They sent out their legions, tasted the land's bounty, but ultimately, the call of Rome was too strong. They returned, leaving the Germanic tribes to their own devices, to the shaping of their own destinies.",
            "The bowl stared back. A dark abyss. Not emptiness, not quite.  Something hung there.  A presence.  Thought, if it could be called that, came and went like desert wind.  A flicker. A sigh.  The artist’s words came back, a whisper now, from years ago.  Frame it.  Simplify.  But the frame wouldn't hold.  The scene pressed in, too much, too much detail.   Picasso, he had his blues. Monet, his greens.  The Italians, a riot of color.  And me?  Me, I was drowning in brown.  This was it.  The start.  The story waiting to be told.  The work.  \n\nFingertips touched the cold porcelain.  Muscles tensed, a slow tremor running up the arm.  A will to shape, to form.  The water, a mirror, still and deep.  A shiver down the spine.  The brown thing, it resisted.  Stuck like a leech.  More water.  More swirling, more pushing.  Muscles strained, a beat of panic.  A smack.  The handle of the toilet.  A splash.  The water.  The brown thing.\n\nMop in hand.  Tie choking.  The air thick.  A message left.  A silent scream.  He thought it was art.\n\nMore water.  More stillness.  Then the hand reached for the paper.  Wrapped it around itself, a shroud.  A glove.  A second skin.\n\nThe hand dipped.  Slow.  Deep.  Like a mother reaching for her child.  But this child was not born of love.  This child was born of need.  Of desperation.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones.  A confluence of things. The kind of fatal vector that lays bare the frailty of youth.  The doctors say the brain ain't full grown. Not ready for the road.  And the road, it chews up the inexperienced. More wrecks. More roll-overs. More speed. More straying from the line.  Kids their age piled in. A known fact. The California people, they did a study.  Linked the age of the passenger to the odds of a wreck. It's a dark math.\n\nThey try to hold them back.  Temporary licenses, hours clipped, no young'uns in the back.  But that ain't the answer. The truth is, the young ones, by the numbers, they ain't ready.  Not for the weight of it. Not for the risk.  The doctor Zuckerman, he says eighteen's too young. Says they crave the edge, the rush. The need for speed. It's in their blood.  Let 'em wait.  Let the fire in their belly cool a little. \n\nKeep 'em off the road. A few more years.  The numbers don't lie. The road's a hungry thing. And soon enough, the next generation will be coming. Millions of them. Ready to drive.\n\nWe could teach them.  Driver's ed.  But the wheel, no.  Not till they're older.  Let 'em get some sense in their heads.  Then a permit.  Then the hours behind the wheel.  The same hours every state's got.  California's got six hours behind the wheel and fifty with an adult.  That's the way.  Nationwide.  One law.  One rule for all.\n\nIt ain't a new idea.",
            "The Library of Congress, a repository of shadows and dust, held a cache of Edison's early films. Fifteen trick films, fragments of a forgotten time, flickered to life between 1895 and 1901. Illusions, spun from the threads of editing, danced across the screen. My study sought to map the poetics of these phantoms, to trace the ghosts of innovation that haunted their later brethren. \n\nMostly, these films were bound to the stage, trapped within the frame of a proscenium. The camera, a watchful eye, remained fixed, unmoving. Long shots and the occasional medium shot, devoid of close-ups, held sway.  A single idea, a single moment, captured in a single shot. The one-shot rule, a strict code, dictated the length, seldom exceeding a minute, a blink in the vast expanse of time.  \n\nThe stage's legacy lingered. Figures moved side to side, bound by the proscenium's invisible bars. Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, a film from the year 1900,  offered a stark example. Actors marched in and out, confined to the horizontal axis, the camera unyielding in its gaze.  No pursuit, no movement towards or away.\n\nLike phantoms on a stage, these films existed in a world of artifice. Close-ups, a language of intimacy, were absent. The audience, as in the theater, beheld the whole, framed within the proscenium's embrace.  Narrative, confined by the single shot, was sparse. The films were vaudeville in essence, a series of tricks—magic, disappearances, substitutions— fleeting moments of wonder.\n\nBut appearances can be deceiving. One conceptual shot, a single breath of the story, might be a tapestry woven from many threads. Mary, Queen of Scots, a film from 1895, offered a glimpse into this hidden world. The severed head, a phantom image, hinted at the artifice, the joins in the fabric.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline. A man of the soil. A farmer. But not just any farmer. He held fast to a creed, a vision of a republic built on the back of the land, on the sweat of honest labor.  His words, they rang out like a hammer blow, striking at the heart of government, demanding liberty, demanding freedom from the grasping hands of power. His creed, it was born of the earth, of the furrows he plowed, of the harvest he reaped. He saw the government as a blade, sharp and dangerous, capable of cutting away at the very fabric of a free man's life.\n\nHe believed the young nation held a promise, a chance to forge a new path, unburdened by the ghosts of old empires. The land, it was a canvas, and the people, the artists. They could paint a picture of self-governance, a nation where the rights of man, like the roots of a mighty oak, stood firm and unshakeable.  He saw these rights as a fragile web, interconnected, each strand dependent on the others.  If one broke, the whole tapestry frayed.\n\nBut Taylor knew the darkness within man, the hunger for power, the instinct to dominate.  He spoke of a duality, a battle that raged within every heart, a struggle between good and evil.  He believed a government must be built to withstand this storm, to hold back the tide of corruption.  He sought a government that protected property, that nurtured the land, that kept the wolves of capitalism at bay.\n\nHe called for a government of limited scope, bound by the chains of the Constitution, its powers spelled out in black and white.  He saw the danger of a sprawling, bloated government, a beast that consumed all in its path. But a simple reading of the words, he warned, was a dangerous path. The spirit, the intent, it must be understood. He looked to the Declaration of Independence, a testament to the sovereignty of the states, the foundation of their freedom.",
            "The figures, they told a story. Figure Seventeen, it showed a fall off, a sudden drop in those commuter logs come the third month. A kind of dying ember. It was disquietening to see it, hard to say why the fire went out. Winter had come to the New England campus, biting wind and snow. Fewer souls on bikes or on foot, that much was clear. And December, it was the end of the fall term, a time for books and deadlines and the frantic scramble to close out the semester. The log, it might have slipped the mind, lost in the shuffle. Then came the holidays, a season of rushing and feasting, and the campus emptied, folks scattered to their homes. Come January, the spring term began, and still the logs were scant. February, it was a mystery.\n\nThe project, it had a life of its own, a quick burst of energy at first, like a flame ignited. Then, the natural pull of the embers, a fading glow. To fight it, they put on a show, a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, a blaze of prizes and promises. It worked, the logs climbed back up. But the lesson was clear: keeping the fire burning, that's a fight. The holidays, the breaks, the natural ebb and flow of things, they all work against you.\n\nAnother thing, people and their cars. Freedom, independence, that's what they crave, woven into the fabric of this land. So carrots, they had to offer carrots. Gift cards here, a massage there, a book, a cup of coffee. It worked, but maybe more could have been done. A bicycle, a sleek hybrid, even a silent electric car, those would have been prizes worth fighting for. Maybe then the logs wouldn't have fallen so low. The prizes, they stayed the same. But what if they grew, a promise of something better, something bigger? A bicycle in December, then a hybrid in January, a whisper of an electric car in February. Maybe then, the fire wouldn't have died.",
            "The Exchange Traded Fund, or ETF, a curious construct. Like an index fund, it seeks to mirror a collection of assets, be it a market index, a commodity, or a basket of securities. Yet it moves with the quickness of a lone stock, traded on the open exchange. It offers the spread of the index, the freedom of a single share. You can sell it short, leverage its rise, buy in fractions. Its cost, a shadow compared to the mutual fund's burden. But there is a price for this agility - a commission for every trade, a toll on the path.  And there are others, whispers of danger. Can the diversification it promises truly hold, or is it a mirage? \n\nThis, then, is the question we grapple with: the ETF IHF. We dissect its heart, its ten biggest holdings, which claim dominion over 63.58% of its assets. Can these ten stand in for the whole? Do they truly capture the essence of the fund, or are they but a flawed reflection?\n\nWe examine their influence, their weight in the portfolio's rise and fall, their Beta, their return.  A portfolio built on these ten, we find, would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself. Its Beta, a measure of volatility, would be lower, a whisper in the storm.\n\nBut is this difference real, or a figment of chance? To answer, we delve deeper, measuring the standard deviation of each stock, their inherent risk, and compare it against the ETF's own.",
            "Dream-Land, one of Poe's own pronouncements, a better thing. In it, words like \"Thulé,\" whispered twice, echo back from Virgil. A place north of Britain, a rim of the known world, the Greeks called it. Virgil used it, that's certain. But a shadow falls, a more immediate source. Poe, he was drawn to the dark German tongues.\n\nThis much is said in the book, Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, by Karl J. Arndt. The two poems, he sees a kinship, a likeness in their sorrow. Poe, mimicking the German master.\n\nThe Oxford Companion speaks of Goethe, his Faust, a play in two parts, the first birthing in 1808, the second in the year of the master's own passing, 1832. Within this second part, a poem, \"The King of Thulé.\" A king, grief-stricken, his queen gone, a goblet her parting gift. He drinks, remembers, and finally, finds his solace in death. The king of Thulé, the king of Poe's dream, shadows entwined, a doppelganger of loss, a crutch of drink.\n\nFaust, translated into play by H.P. Grattan, just a year before Poe's own use of \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" \n\n\"Ultima Thule,\" whispered once in the Pit, but twice in Dream-Land, bookends of the poem. The King of Thulé, Dream-Land, companions on this dark journey. The speaker, he walks through the landscape of Thulé, a land of shades, of ghosts, of a world drained of color. It echoes the king's grief, his loneliness, the slow decay of his will.\n\nGoethe, a titan of language, a name known to Poe, if for no other reason than his admiration for Tennyson.  The master's influence, a whisper in the wind, a touch in the night, a reflection in the mirror of Poe's own soul.",
            "The law in these parts, they call it California, says a man can be made to pay more than just for the harm he's done.  If a man acts with malice.  Say a woman, Jennifer Palmer, slips on a puddle of applesauce in a store, a place they call D&D Markets.  And say the manager, a man named Martin, he's been told twice about the mess, twice!  But he's busy with his supper, he says.  A half-hour passes, the woman falls, breaks her back. Now she wants more than just what the doctor's gonna cost her. She wants to bleed the man dry.  She wants punishment.\n\nThe judge, he ain't gonna throw her claim out just like that.  California law says a man can be made to pay more if he acted with a kind of knowing disregard for the harm he might cause.  Despicable, they call it.  Jennifer, she'll say Martin knew the applesauce was a danger, knew folks had been slipping before.  Six times, she'll say, in the year gone by.  And still he didn't clean it up.  \n\nNow, whether his actions were truly despicable, that's a tougher call.  But it's a question for a jury.  And the facts, well, they speak for themselves.  The day of the spill, a young man, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce.  Martin, he says he's on break, no time for complaints. Then another man, Mary Haddigan, he tells Martin too. Same answer.  Half an hour later, Jennifer Palmer comes along, slips, and falls.  \n\nThe question is, did Martin know the applesauce was a danger?  Did he willfully ignore it?  That's what the jury will have to decide.",
            "Four years gone now, a course in Islam taken at CBC.  The air hung thick with the smoke of argument, the question burning bright: Was Islam a religion of violence? It seems a question more urgent now than ever.  The world's eye, since that day in '01, has shifted. From the glare of hostility towards Islam, towards the extremists, to a tolerance bordering on the blind. A man named Barack Obama, a name that might have been met with scorn back then, could now stand for the highest office.  A man with a lineage entwined with the faith.\n\nThe Prophet's story, it has a pull. The facts I'd gathered, the history I'd absorbed, painted a different picture. Muhammad, the conqueror, the one who subjugated tribes, forcing them to bend the knee to his God. But the biography, it tells another tale. A man of humility, misunderstood, even. He offered his truth, and men, drawn to its light, came to him.\n\nA shadow falls over the similarities between the ministries. Jesus, the Son of Man, and Muhammad, each with their miracles. A feast multiplied from meager provisions to feed forty. It's a deliberate echo, a striving to cast Muhammad as a prophet of simple truth, needing no grand pronouncements. A fallacy, a cheap trick. It diminishes the miracle of Christ, steals his light. \n\nThe stories, they strive to prove the truth of the faith, the power of conversion.  But they whisper, they relay, they recount tales told through a veil of second, third, and fourth-hand accounts.  The truth fades, obscured, leaving behind a shadow of doubt.\n\nThe most troubling thing, the weight that settles in the gut, is the attempt to elevate Muhammad.  A man of gentleness, wisdom, and grace. But history, it tells a different story. A tale of ambition, of conquest. One wonders, if true history were known, would the faith itself be shaken? Would the edifice of belief crumble?",
            "The Word went out, spoken and carried on the wind. But the wind, it shifts. The currents of thought, they turned, leaving the man from Nazareth behind in the dust. Look back, and you’ll see the path of Christ’s flock straying, year by year, further from the shepherd’s fold. This world now, it spins faster, hungers for change, for a new dawn. The old ways cling, a brittle husk, resisting the tide. But the tide, it won’t be denied. \n\nA remembering will come, a yearning for the bone of truth buried under layers of creed and dogma.  A sifting, a searching.  Decades, maybe centuries, it will take.  But the river runs back to the source.  The clock hands will turn, one by one, stripping away the accretions, leaving bare the stark words of the man who walked the hills of Galilee.  \n\nThis wind will blow across the land, from sea to shining sea.  It will gather the faithful, not to a single flock, but to a single understanding.  The church, the institution, it will stand, a weathered sentinel, guiding the way.  Yet the flock will be thinned, the multitude of voices unified in the purity of the original song. \n\nThis is how history bends, how empires rise and fall, how darkness yields to light.  Remember the Romans, who once crushed the Christians beneath their heel? Now they kneel before the very cross they erected. Remember the chains that bound the enslaved, and the day they rose.  \n\nThis too, will come to pass.  We must learn to read the scriptures anew, not with the eye of the letter, but with the heart of the spirit.  \n\nFor before Jesus came, there was only the echo of the One true God.  There was only the ancient covenant, whispered across the desert sands.  Judaism, the seed from which Christianity sprung.  A faith rooted in the word, in the law, in the unwavering belief in a single, all-powerful God.",

He builds his towers, his monuments of steel and stone, and in their shadows the world bleeds out. The Jungle, it shows you this. The men who own the gears, the men who pull the strings, they see no soul but their own reflected in the glass of the boardroom. They speak of progress, of wealth, but their words are the smoke that chokes the air, the effluent that poisons the river.  \n\nSinclair, he paints the picture with words like a man with blood on his hands. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" he writes. And what a sky it is, choked with the godless breath of a thousand furnaces. The men inside them, they are cogs, their lives measured in the clanging rhythms of the machines. \"From the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" Sinclair says. No loyalty, no decency, only the hunger for the next dollar, the next profit.\n\nThe workers, they are the ground beneath the feet of the beasts. They toil and sweat and bleed, their bodies ground down like the grain they process, their lives a handful of dust in the wind. There are no laws to protect them, no solace in the night.

            "The telling of a story. It's a matter of weaving a mood, a feeling, around the bone of it. Some men do this better than others. Fitzgerald, he knew this.  He'd take a word, a thing, and pair it with something else, something it don't rightly belong with, and suddenly, you see it in a new light. He did this with colors, too. Gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. He'd stain them with meaning, make them hum with a certain resonance, then he'd fling them back at you, these colors, to remind you of what he wanted you to feel about something. He did it with white and gray, these two sides of the same coin. White, clean, a kind of false purity. Gray, the fading of it all.\n\nHe starts laying it down early, this meaning, in this story of Gatsby's. Daisy and Jordan, always in white.  Everyone in white, it seems. Nick in his white flannels, Tom in his white shirt, Catherine powdered white as bone. Even the party, when Nick is trying to get a handle on it, there's a break from the white, a burst of gaudy color. But the white comes back, a constant, a tide.  He sees it in the buildings, the names on a list, even the way the people move through the city. It's everywhere.\n\nThen, when you think you've got it figured out, he takes the white and the gray and he leans in close, and he shows you Daisy. And she's lost in the white again, a ghost in a little white roadster. Not a woman, not really. Just a thing he wants, a white dream. And the gray, it creeps in around her too, a haze of fur, a whisper of forgotten things.  He's making a point, you see. Daisy isn't just a woman. She's a symbol, a reflection of something deeper, something that's already gone.",
            "The sun-scorched earth of San Diego County yields bounty. Tomatoes plump beneath the endless sky, citrus trees groan with fruit, and the land whispers its secrets in the rustle of leafy greens and the scent of ripe squash and the bitter bite of pepper. They say the people here hunger for this earth, for the taste of what grows free from the taint of chemicals. Organic. A word whispered like a prayer in the marketplace, where long lines snake past tables piled high with eggs and milk from contented cows. Farther out, beyond the clamor, the farms stand silent, offering more than just sustenance. There, on these sun-baked acres, you might find a man with calloused hands and eyes that hold the wisdom of the soil, offering tours through the rows of plants and the fields where birds sing their silent songs. This, they say, is the way. A way to feed the soul and the body, to walk the path of the earth and leave it richer for your passing.\n\nBut the path is not always easy. The earth demands respect, a constant vigilance against the pests that gnaw and the weeds that choke. The hands that toil are weary, the back aches with the burden of labor. The yields may come smaller, the losses heavier, but the reward lies in the whispers of the wind through the trees, the dance of the butterflies, the symphony of life that blooms in the absence of poison.\n\nThis land, this parcel of chaparral and oak woodland, sits heavy with history. It has known the touch of ancient people, the rumble of cattle hooves, the silence of forgotten dreams. It is a place where the whispers of the past mingle with the cries of the present, a tapestry woven from the threads of time. Here, in the shadow of the Cleveland National Forest, the land and the people stand at a crossroads. They say there are programs, whispers of assistance, to help those who choose this path, to help them find balance, to heal the land and themselves. But the burden of choice rests on their shoulders, a heavy weight in the hands of a farmer who seeks both profit and peace.",
            "The land of culture, it ain't a clear path. It's more like a tangled thicket, shadows and sunlight mingling. You can't grasp it whole, can't pin it down.  Sayin' all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, that's like trying to paint a whole sky with a single brushstroke. Too broad, too quick. \n\nYou gotta learn the rhythm of the place, the music it plays. How it whispers in the wind, how it echoes in the heart. A man walkin' into a foreign land sees it through the lens of his own, comparisons bloomin' up like weeds. \n\nUnderstanding another's way, that's a journey.  You gotta pore over their histories, their scars and their stories. But don't go in to judge or change it. Just breathe it in, feel its weight. Work within its lines, especially if you're standin' at a disadvantage. Out there, respect's your only shield against the unknown.\n\nCulture ain't just about borders, it's a web woven tight.  Even within a nation, companies build their own little worlds.  Some run on long days and hard labor, others on a more leisurely pace.  Look at their clothes, how they speak, who they trust.  It's all there, writ in the lines of their faces, the way they move.\n\nValues, now those are the heart of the matter. They tell you why a culture ticks.  If shame is a heavy weight, a man won't risk it for a deal. If hardship is a badge of honor, he'll fight tooth and nail.\n\nBefore you sit at the table, you gotta know these things. But even then, learn the man across from you.  Find the threads that bind, the common ground. That's where the real bargainin' begins.",
            "The fool, he'd say in his heart, \"No God.\"  Psalm 14, the Book of Psalms, says so. And Anselm, the holy man, he built his case on those words.  The same God, the God of the Covenant, is the God that Aquinas spoke of too.  So we'll assume they both knew him, this God, the one from the scriptures. Otherwise, comparing their arguments would be like comparing apples to... well, something else entirely.\n\nNow, both men, they had their points. But neither, not really, gave us a whole picture. A complete grounding for belief.\n\nTake Anselm first.  He looked inward, to the soul. He said, to understand God, you have to look within. For if you can conceive of God, you can't conceive of him not being. It's a tangled path, this one, his words sometimes hard to follow. But the heart of it is this: God is known through the knowing itself. He's within us already. No need for signs or wonders, just the sureness of what we know. Faith, they call it.\n\nAquinas, he was different.  He sought proof in the world, in the things we can see and touch.  No faith needed, he said, just reason.  Five arguments he laid out, each one a building block. Change, cause, chance, degrees of perfection, and the harmony of the universe.  He said, if you see a puzzle missing a piece, you know it's there, even if you can't see it. The logic of it demands it.",
            "The man they called Buddha was born, somewhere in the shadow of that long ago century, fifth or sixth. A prince, he cast aside the world, sought the silence within. His words took root and grew, flowering into the faith of Buddhism, a tendril of which was known as Theravada. Five hundred years have turned since his passing, and the tendrils have stretched, taken on new forms. In Sri Lanka, where the Theravada roots run deep, they hold a ceremony, cutting water. Monks and the lay folk alike gather, a ritual born not of Buddha's own hand but of time and change. The differences, they run deep, from the surface of things to the heart of the matter. Both monk and layman, bound by the faith, have had to shift, to bend the ancient doctrines to the wind. Forces, both dark and light, have pressed upon them.\n\nThere are words we'll be using, words to guide us through this tangled wood. Internal, external. The internal is born of the followers of the Buddha's path, whether robed or not. The external, from those who walk a different road. Hostile, a force that seeks to wound the faith, to twist and break its branches. Benign, a force that means neither harm nor good, but which may bring one or the other in its wake. These words, they will echo through these pages.\n\nFirst, let us speak of the core. The doctrines that bind the Theravada heart. They seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, it is the Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. Suttas, Vinaya, Abhidhamma. The Suttas, the words of the Buddha. The Vinaya, the rules of conduct, the path laid out for both monk and layman. The Abhidhamma, the metaphysics, the nature of being. The teachings of no-self, of suffering, of impermanence. These are the truths that bind and break the wheel of Samsara, the endless turning of birth and death. Desire, hatred, delusion, all fade when the light of enlightenment breaks through. In the Vinaya, the rules are laid out, five for the layman, a shield against harm: no killing, no lying, no stealing, no unchastity, no intoxication. For the monk, the path is longer, the rules more intricate. But at the heart, the four noble truths remain: the truth of suffering, the truth of its cause, the truth of its cessation, the truth of the path that leads to it.",
            "The two nations, the United States and Mexico, were once bound by a rivalry that stretched like a long, lean shadow, fifty-seven years from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The high tide of this animosity crested in the Mexican-American War, a conflict of 1846-1848 where the United States, in a swift and brutal reckoning, subdued Mexico. Texas and the Southwest fell into American hands, wounds fresh and festering.  \n\nBut this was only the storm's eye. Smaller skirmishes, like brush fires, flared between the two nations, finally dying down in the hushed stillness before the First World War.  The roots of their discord ran deep, tangled in religion, culture, and the tangled web of material interests. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dance of rivalry is not unfamiliar. Nations that share a border, their fates intertwined, often find themselves locked in a struggle for dominance, a tug-of-war over land and resources.  The United States and Mexico are but one example among many.  David M. Pletcher (1977) wrote, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both nations, geographically close, have stood in opposition to American expansion, while others in Latin America have found more fertile ground for cooperation.\n\nReligion, a potent and divisive force, also cast a dark shadow over their relationship. Sally Frahm (2001) points out, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Like the Cold War, a battle fought not just on battlefields but in the minds of men, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was fueled by a clash of ideologies, albeit ones rooted in faith, not politics.  This distrust, inherited from the old empires, the English and the Spanish, proved a formidable barrier to any hope of lasting peace.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalogued seventeen disputes between the two nations during that fifty-seven year period. Most were skirmishes over territory, border raids, and the ever-present threat of violence at the frontier.  Bandits and outlaws, like wolves on the prowl, preyed on both sides of the border, their presence a constant reminder of the volatile tension. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to wane as Mexico, caught in the grip of need, leaned heavily on the United States for support.  (p. 109)  In the dying embers of the nineteenth century, American ambitions shifted from territorial conquest to a more insidious form of control: economic intervention in Mexico. (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years gone now.  A sudden sickness, a fate unseen. It took hold like a fever, stole my strength, left me hollowed out. A nurse I was, back then. The steady work, the comfort of the sickbed, a shield against the ghosts of a childhood too harsh. \"Always a need,\" they'd say, \"for hands that mend. People will always be broken.\" So I built my life on that promise.  Science, journalism, those were the dreams, buried deep. But the need was stronger.\n\nForty-six years, alone, with nothing but dust in the bank. The years crawl on, fifteen of them, stretched thin on a government's meager grace. My own, I own nothing.  A hand-to-mouth existence, each day a battle against the gnawing fear, the hollow ache of what might have been. Nothing certain but the cold grip of need. Yet through it all, a truth remains. Family, friends, a lifeline thrown.  They held me steady when the world spun. And believe this, in the face of true ruin, you find out just how empty your strength is.\n\nLife, it throws its storms. Big and small, they come without warning. No map, no guide.  We can preach preparedness, build our bunkers, but some things are too vast, too cruel.\n\nThey say we must cut our ties with the government, its ship run aground.  But what good is a lone island when the sea is rising?  I say, let us learn to trust again, to build bridges, to share the burden. Our forefathers, they didn't conquer hardship alone. It was compassion, respect, the sharing of what little they had that saw them through. The wagons trains, they rolled westward on shared hope, not rugged defiance.\n\nBe ready, yes, I am.  Water purification, canned goods, a first-aid kit, the tools to weather the storm.   A wood stove, a garden if you have the land. But alongside these things,  reach out. Know your neighbor, their story, their struggles. For in the end, it is the bonds we weave that will endure.",
            "The question of form, of how life takes shape, has haunted the minds of men since time immemorial.  Why do these creatures twist and turn, these shells, these bones, into the patterns they do? Are there invisible threads guiding them, unseen constraints upon their becoming?  Even now, the naturalist barely scratches the surface, struggling to capture the essence of creation in the cold logic of numbers.  Yet men have tried.  They have sought to quantify the dance of the whorls, to map the spiral path of growth in these mollusk shells, these Prunum.  \n\nThey speak of mathematical models, of software that can conjure forms, and they delve into the past, tracing the lineage of these shells through the eons. They peer into the heart of the shell, the columella, that central thread through which the whorls unfurl.  They count the turns, the sutures that bind them, the aperture that breathes life into the empty form.  And they seek to understand, to unravel the mystery of how these silent creatures, these Prunum, have shaped themselves through the endless passage of time. \n\nThey speak of the shell as a journey, a pilgrimage through space and time, a spiral path etched into the fabric of existence.  They see the apex, the starting point, the base where it rests.  They trace the path of the aperture, the opening through which life itself emerges.  They try to capture the essence of this journey, to translate it into language the mind can grasp.  \n\nAnd perhaps, just perhaps, they will find the answer.",
            "The death of infants and newborns in this land of Java and Sumatra, it has hung steady these last ten years.  The country aims for the promised moons of those Millennium Declarations, clean water and the like, but the children and their mothers, they fall short.  The reasons for this failing are many, and lie not in the programs themselves, but in the bones of the system.\n\nThey boast of births attended by learned hands, 72% they say, but these hands are not always of the doctor. Midwives, women of the village, they attend, but no knife to staunch a hemorrhage, no scales to weigh the fading life.  So the mothers bleed out, a silent toll.\n\nThe children, too, they suffer.  Diarrhea, a scourge of the young, treated less and less by those with skill.  And the care after birth, a shadow, a whisper, lacking for the mother and child alike.\n\nThe steel cuts, the cesarean, a rare thing here.  4% maybe, a whisper compared to the cities where it's 7%.  The knife, a luxury for the city dweller, a phantom for the farmer.  And the poor, they are forgotten, the line between rich and poor a chasm.  27%, they say, the difference in care.  The cost of healing, a wall too high for them to climb.\n\nSo what then, the question hangs, a shroud over the land.  Programs, they offer, quick fixes, but at what cost?  One hand reaches for the child, the other forgets the mother.  Resources diverted, like ants swarming a dropped crumb, leaving the rest to wither.",
            "The Victorian age, a time of suffocating detail and endless pronouncements on the station of the titled. Yet even in that gilded cage, shadows stirred.  Two novels, *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, claw at the edges of this tradition, venturing into the realm of the uncanny. Both weave a tapestry of mystery, a hint of the perverse, a dissonance that resonates through the characters, illuminating their motives, their buried grief.  \n\nConsider this passage from Dickens: \n\n>“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nA fever dream, a descent into chaos. These novels, they use this disquiet often, in dreams, in visions, though the purpose shifts with each turn. In *Oliver Twist*, these phantoms delve into the boy's own wounded soul, revealing the ache within, the recognition of a world turned cruel. When the shooting finally returns, in chapter 28, it's a reliving, a reenactment, as if through a fogged glass.  He seeks help, but the world spins, the hand of fate a cold, unseen thing.  The senses are numb, the pain a constant ache, a companion to the fear.  Whose will brought this down upon him? Not his own, not in this maelstrom. A sense of defeat creeps in, a hardening of the spirit, as if Fagin's darkness has begun to seep into him, a poison that numbs the will to resist.\n\nAnd again, from *Wuthering Heights*:\n\n>“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "Two years back I was working the after-school shift, tutoring the small ones. English and reading, that's where my own light shone brightest. They sent me a boy named Adrian. Third or fourth grade, maybe. Trouble reading, he was.  Something off about it, the way he struggled. Some letters, clear as day. Others, not a lick of sense. Like a broken clock, telling different times.  He spoke English right good, this boy, though. Latino, that much was plain. \n\nThen came the day I was left holding the fort while the rest of the kids were gone on some outing. Adrian's mother walked in. Not a word of English passed her lips, just Spanish. My own Spanish, well, it was threadbare, a learner's tongue. But we managed. Then it hit me, like a stone dropped from a height. Adrian, he could read fine. It was just the alphabet he didn't know.  English letters, strange to him. Don't know if it helped much, but I hope the boy's doing better now. \n\nI tell this story, because the language gap in these schools, it's a damn canyon.  Especially here in California. And it ain't always so clear cut. A kid speaking English perfect might still struggle. Reading, it can be a hard birth. \n\nAdrian, his problem was simple:  English reading, the alphabet, the sounds.  But for the kids barely speaking English, it's a heavier load. No single answer, no magic bullet. Dual language, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of it solves it alone.  It takes everything, all mixed together.\n\nDual language, it ain't just for Spanish speakers. For all the kids. They say it's a waste, that it won't help the majority. Lies. Make it the rule, not the exception, and everyone benefits. But how? Every teacher bilingual? Unrealistic.  But maybe, just maybe, some helpers, aides, whatever you call 'em, who speak both tongues.",
            "The world tells you from the start there's somethin' bigger. Somethin' vast. Unreckonable. They send you to pews or temples or they tell you to find it in the dark corners of your own skull. Most swallow it whole, the stories passed down like worn rosary beads. But some, they spit it out.  Say there's nothin' but the skin of your own world.  They build their own gods, their own cages.  And the path? It twists and turns, searchin' for some light in the goddamn dark. \n\n\"A cardinal,\" my pa said, when I asked him what bird he liked best. We were on the porch, rain drummin' on the tin roof, stink of wet earth and smoke in the air.  He was lookin' out at the water runnin' from the gutters, drownin' the plants.  His eyes, they were lost, half-rememberin', half-searchin'.  He'd thinned out, his clothes hangin' like rags.  Hair scraggly, like the last tendrils of a winter storm. He didn't look at me. Couldn't.  I felt it, the lonesome pull, the fear. Couldn't speak it, not out loud.  'Cause sayin' it would make it real. So I hugged him, pulled my chair closer, and watched the rain with him, the sky bleedin' purple and gray.\n\nHe died in December, five days after my twenty-second year.  Chemo and radiation, they kept him breathin', but nothin' eased the burnin'.  A few more months, they said.  What good that was, I couldn't say.  What kind of God would do that?  Layin' there in the dark, no prayers came. If He was listenin', He stopped a long time ago.\n\nDidn't want to watch him go.  Didn't want to see the light fade from his eyes.  Wanted to hold him in the way he was, not the way he wasn't.  Knew him better than anyone else.  He wouldn't have wanted me there, watchin' the end.  Curled up tight in my bed, waitin' for the news.\n\nThey didn't call.",
            "The Gothic, a name that sings of contradiction, an oxymoron for \"Old-New\" as Watt declared. Praised and damned, mocked and lauded for its glimpse of the terrible sublime -  a dance with darkness. Walpole, he who birthed the beast with his *Castle of Otranto*, wove threads of ancient romance and the newfangled novel. An echo of the stage, a mimicry of nature, a \"Gothic Story,\" he called it.  He drew upon the bones of Gothic theatre, its architecture, its lore. A tattered word, \"Gothic,\" flung against epochs and peoples, marked archaic, unsophisticated. Yet, in its shadow, a new light flickered. The intimacy of the novel, the peering into the soul of man, gave the Gothic a strange life, a timeless resonance. \n\nAnd from the ashes of chivalry arose a specter. The medieval knight, brave, honorable, competent, a fading ideal in the eyes of the writers, especially Walpole. They saw a world gone soft, a world lacking the steel of the past. Chivalry, they held, was the cure, a balm for the wounds of modernity.  The \"gothic past\" shimmered, romanticized, a promise of what might have been. Walpole, caught in the maelstrom of politics, a man unjustly accused, saw this decay. Did he yearn for a simpler time, for the supposed virtue of a bygone age? \n\nFrederic, his prince, a figure sculpted from chivalric dreams. He was a prince, yes, marked by suffering, touched by tragedy. \"Gallant,\" \"courteous,\" a knight raised to an impossible height, a trope echoing through the ages. An exaggeration, a hint of the Gothic excess to come.",
            "The movement of goods, a river of commerce, flows from the customer's want to the raw earth itself. From there it spills through the channels of supply, production, and distribution, finally reaching the waiting hands of its maker. This river, this chain, was given its name in the year of '82 by a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant who saw the need for order in the chaos. He spoke of planning, of wielding control over this flow, of making it swift and sure, all to satisfy the hunger of the customer.  \n\nSix pillars hold this chain aloft. Production, supply, the hoard of inventory, the choice of place, the rumble of transport, and the whispers of information.  These are the tools the manager wields, shaping the river to serve the needs of the consumer.\n\nProduction, the first and most vital link. Here the ground is broken, the earth yielded. It is the heart of the chain, beating with the rhythm of want and need. The manager must know what the customer desires, what whispers on the wind of the marketplace. The market, a vast and shifting sea, holds the answers. Through its currents, the manager discerns the demands, the call for this or that.  Then comes the decision: what shall be made, and in what quantity? The manager, with a keen eye, chooses the place of creation, the factory that will best serve both volume and quality, the place where the river will flow truest.  Finally, the manager sets the pace of work, the maintenance of the machinery, for every detail here is etched in stone, every misstep a cost in time and coin. For I have seen the wheels grind to a halt, the river choked, in the face of carelessness.\n\nSupply, the second pillar. It speaks of strategy, of forging alliances and choosing partners. A single product may have many faces, many divisions, each with its own tools, its own workers, its own mastery. The manager must decide where each piece fits, where each thread is woven. And sometimes, the manager chooses to yield, to outsource, to let another hand shape the clay. This is done for velocity, for the swiftness with which goods are made and delivered, for the flexibility to adapt, and for the ever-present need to keep the cost low, the river flowing clear.",
            "The sign, a scrap of cardboard held aloft, spoke of things best left unsaid.  \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it declared in a scrawling hand, the ink bleeding into the fibers like a dying man's blood.  Ellen Page, face pale and drawn under the harsh glare of the streetlamps, stood alone.  \n\nBurma. A place name that tasted of dust and sorrow. A land ruled by men with iron fists and eyes as black as the crows that circled above the jade-green rice paddies. A junta, they called them, these men who seized power in a whirlwind of bullets and betrayal. Since '62, the year the world shifted on its axis, Burma had been a country choked by silence. Until the Saffron Revolution. Monks, their robes the color of dying embers, rose up, their chanting a challenge to the storm clouds gathering over the land.  \n\nThe government, a viper coiled in its own poison, allowed the protests at first, a cruel amusement. But the whispers grew louder, the crowds swelled. The viper struck. Monasteries, havens of peace, were overrun, their sacred halls echoing with the cries of the fallen. Foreign eyes, seeking the truth, were dragged into the darkness, their lenses forever capturing the horror. Kenji Nagai, a man who dared to witness, paid the ultimate price. \n\nOne thousand, they said. Three thousand, whispered the wind. But the Colonel, a shadow escaping the viper's coils, spoke of a number too terrible to utter. \n\nThis, this was not new. The hunger for power, the thirst for control, it was a disease that festered in the heart of men. The Caesars, draped in their purple robes, claimed to be chosen by the gods, their will absolute. The emperors of Japan, shrouded in myth and whispered prayers, believed themselves divine. And here, in the land of the free, a man named Bush, his face a mask of piety, sought counsel from a man called Haggard, a shepherd of souls steeped in the darkness of the abyss.  \n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity yearning for freedom, met with the cold steel of tanks. June 4th, a date etched in blood. The official count, a lie whispered by the wind. In Rwanda, the jungle ran red with the blood of innocents, the cries of the slaughtered swallowed by the silence of the world. And the Third Reich, a testament to the depths of human depravity, where the stench of death lingered long after the ashes had settled.  \n\nThe world, a tapestry woven with threads of light and darkness, turned its gaze away. But the truth, like a wound that never heals, remained.",
            "Duke Ellington. A name that hangs heavy in the air of jazz. His legacy's woven from the thread of years, spun long and taut. It's in the shaping of his orchestra, his hand upon the keys a whisper, a guide. His compositions, they breathe with a richness, a complexity, showcasing the bones and sinew of each man in the band.  \n\nHe built a framework, a cage of sound where souls could soar, improvise.  Tightly woven phrases, orchestrated, demanding the particular grace of each player, each note a brushstroke on a canvas of sound.  He coaxed the tone of the whole, birthing something new, something singular. A testament to the music itself.\n\nThe Grove, that book of hushed pronouncements, speaks of Ellington's sound, his daring. \"Creole Love Call,\" they say, using the voice as an instrument. A threadbare blues, twelve bars, six choruses, each one a different shade of the same sorrow. The voice, it starts smooth, a lover's caress, then rasps, a plea from the abyss. The trumpet, muted, a sigh, a lament, reaching for notes beyond the ordinary. The clarinet, a cry, soaring, lost in a sea of syncopated piano. The brass, the reeds, they echo, they answer.  A crescendo, a final chorus, a voice now a growl, a beast unleashed. A trombone, a final discordant wail, a question unanswered.\n\nAnd the voice, always the voice. A color, a texture, a thing apart. A tool, a weapon, a mirror held up to the soul. This is Ellington's voice, his touch, his lasting legacy. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" the trumpet and the scat, a conversation in tongues. A dance between instrument and voice, each borrowing from the other, a tapestry of sound. And in \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" the trombone, a mournful cry, introducing the melody, a single voice in a wilderness of sound.",
            "The need had always been there. A gnawing, unfillable thing. It began when she was fourteen, a girl on the cusp, and had followed her into the hollow of seventeen. Now she knew it wasn't a thing she craved, but someone. Yet no boy had stirred within her the faintest flicker of interest. Some had tried, stumbling through the clumsy rites of courtship, but they were all strangers, passing shadows.  She questioned herself often, this emptiness a vast and echoing canyon of her own making. Theories formed and dissolved like mist. Nothing concrete, nothing that could satiate the ache. So she lived, adrift in a sea of unanswered questions.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet. Her parents, good people, lived in a rhythm of gentle calm. Their words were seldom sharp, their voices never raised. They argued, rarely, only over her insistence on charting her own course, her vibrant spirit a counterpoint to their measured lives. She was their daughter, yet she was a storm in their stillness, a bright flame in their quiet hearth.\n\nBut today, the air hung thick and heavy. As she wandered, searching for inspiration, a cry tore through the stillness. Her mother's voice, thin and sharp as broken glass. Panic seized her. \"Mom? What is it?\"\n\nShe found her mother sprawled on the kitchen floor, her face etched with pain. \"Ow,\" she gasped, each word a shard of agony. \n\nHer daughter knelt beside her, a hand trembling on her mother's arm. \"Sweetheart, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were squeezed out, each syllable a battle.\n\n\"Okay, Mom,\" she said, her voice tight. \"Where should I meet you?\"\n\nHer mother pointed, her hand trembling. Relief washed over her daughter, gratitude for the strength she had built. She lifted her mother, careful, sure, and carried her to the car. \n\nThe hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear. But fear was a distant whisper compared to the urgency that pulsed through her. She carried her mother inside, her voice a desperate plea for help. \n\nDoctors materialized, faces creased with concern. A gurney appeared, a silent promise of care. They took her mother away, leaving her daughter adrift in a sea of worry.\n\nThe truth, when it came, was simple. A stepping stool, a vase too high, a moment of clumsy grace. It could have been worse.",
            "This study, a reckoning with the ways of heart and blood, sought to prove the claim: that a life lived by the tenets of the Mediterranean Diet, as measured by a score given to the adherence, the so-called 'alternate Mediterranean' or aMed score, would stave off the cruel grip of chronic heart disease and the sudden stroke. This aMed way, a variant of the older Mediterranean ways, calls for the bounty of the earth: plants in their fullness, proteins from the soil and the tree, fat from the olive and the nut, fish from the deep. It calls for a measured hand with animal flesh and the fats that clog the vessels. And it allows, sparingly, for the comfort of wine.\n\nOld studies, like whispers in the wind, had spoken of a link between the Mediterranean way and a lessening of heart's peril, both in life and in death. One trial, a controlled test of will, showed the Mediterranean way more potent than a diet of meagerness in shedding weight and clearing the blood's pathways. But these whispers had not addressed the specter of stroke, nor the shadow of its passing.\n\nThis study, a vigil over seventy-four thousand women, their years between thirty-eight and sixty-three, followed them through two decades, from 1984 to 2004. These women, nurses in the service of health, were part of a larger cohort, a thousand souls strong, scattered across eleven states. Six times, the researchers measured their adherence to the aMed ways through written accounts of their meals, these 'food frequency questionnaires' or FFQs. Over ninety-five percent of these women kept to their pact, their records a testament to their commitment. These accounts, scrutinized and tested, were cross-referenced with the cold records of hospitals and death certificates, seeking truth in the face of mortality.\n\nThe researchers, seeking to banish the ghosts of chance, averaged the aMed scores, smoothing out the peaks and valleys of individual variation. They adjusted for the shadows that could skew the results: age, the habit of smoke, the weight of the body, the state of womanhood, the use of hormones, the intake of vitamins, the solace of wine, the rhythm of physical activity, and the shield of aspirin.\n\nThen, with the tools of statistics, they measured the link between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models to dissect the fatal and the non-fatal.\n\nThe findings were clear: those who lived closer to the aMed ways, with higher scores, faced a lower risk of these afflictions.  Over twenty years, the researchers catalogued a thousand deaths from heart disease, a thousand strokes, and over a thousand deaths from these combined evils. The women at the pinnacle of the aMed scale stood a third less likely to suffer these fates compared to those at the bottom.",
            "The year was two thousand and seven. The bones of the American dream had begun to rattle. A sickness had taken hold, spreading through the veins of the nation. Banks, bloated and gorged on easy credit, stood stripped bare. Houses, once symbols of prosperity, now stood vacant, monuments to a folly. The weight of debt, a shroud, settled upon the land.\n\nThey say it was a storm brewing for years. The whispers began in the Clinton years, when the promise of easy money and a second term twisted the hand of policy. Lending was loosened, a reckless act that loosened the very fabric of the financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, twin pillars of the housing market, were pressured to repackage these risky loans, churning them into securities and selling them off like poisoned fruit.\n\nThe market, drunk on greed, swallowed them whole. But the hangover came swift and brutal. When the piper demanded payment, the borrowers were gone, vanished like smoke in the wind. The banks, hollowed out, had no cushion, no backstop. The rot spread, consuming the very heart of the economy. Lehman Brothers, a titan of finance, crumbled to dust. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold off in fire sales. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, their faces pallid with fear, were forced to bend the knee to the government.\n\nThe scars remain. A generation scarred by a crisis born of hubris and avarice. And the question lingers, a bitter taste in the mouth: What lessons were learned? Were any? Or will we, like moths to a flame, be drawn to the same folly once more?",

Not the good kind of drowning, neither.\n\nExposition ain't your friend.\n\nThey say, show, don't tell.

First, NBC 4, their faces pale and strained, spoke of a man named Shad Hostettler, a shadow cast in a mug shot, and his deeds in Ashley. A wife, nameless, stabbed multiple times.

The price you pay for knowing these things, the weight of it all, that's the burden. To see your own face in your brother's eyes, not the mask you show the world, but the raw truth, the bone beneath. In that looking glass, in the deeds and the dust they leave behind, lies the man. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk this path, a journey etched against the green and humid air.

The story tells it through the voice of the boy, the brother who walks the tightrope between light and dark. His words paint the world and the boy  with the scarlet ibis, both dying things, both beautiful in their fragility. \n\nThe boy, he's driven by pride, a hunger in his soul. From the first time they walk together, through the swamp and the sun-drenched fields, he sees not a brother, but a reflection of his own desires.

They are the pawns, dancing to the tune of the World Controller, their strings pulled by the unseen hand of a system built on illusion.\n\nThe echoes of Marx whisper through the pages. Homogeny, reification, these are the tools of the master, shaping the worker into a cog in the machine. Huxley, through his keen eye, sees the tendrils of this new economy wrapping tight around the human soul.\n\nHe calls it false consciousness. The masses, blinded by their own desires, are kept ignorant of the true relations of power. They chase trinkets and pleasures, their minds numbed by the hypnotic hum of consumption. The Delta, the Gamma, they are the shadows, dancing to the tune of the World Controller's flute. \n\nHegemony, a suffocating shroud, blankets the world. The upper classes, born into their gilded cages, see the truth but choose to remain complicit. They are the shepherds, guiding the flock to the slaughterhouse of their own contentment.  \n\nAnd love? That flickering flame of the human heart is extinguished in this sterile landscape. Relationships are transactional, devoid of depth or meaning.  Men speak of women in terms of their physical attributes, like machines to be used and discarded. \n\nHuxley's world is a warning. A glimpse into a future where technology and capitalism, unchecked, will leave us hollow shells, our souls devoured by the insatiable maw of the system.",
            "The stone walls of these halls had held me for two and a half years, four and a half semesters. Getting ‘round this place, it was a chore like hauling water up a dry well. Freshman year, they stuck me in the East Halls, out past the stadium, past the Jordan Center, near the edge of the world. Willard Building. To get there, from that godforsaken corner, it took a good twenty minutes, feet eatin’ up the asphalt. Sometimes more. Especially when the sky opened up and the rain came down like a fist. \n\nAn old boy, not much older than myself, told me about a time when those halls were islands, surrounded by nothing but empty fields. Now, the fields were gone, swallowed by fresh brick and mortar. The Creamery, the health center, a whole new sprawl of sports fields. The campus, it kept growin’, reachin’ and stretchin’, makin’ the journey from here to there a test of endurance.\n\nHe said, \"Bikes are the answer.\" A silent, hard truth. But the answer ain’t in the bike itself. It’s in the ridin’.  It’s in buildin’ a place where the wheels can turn freely.\n\nMy friend, he’d been off the saddle for years, but he’d found his way back. \"Why ever did I stop?\" he’d said. \"Bikes, they keep you alive.\" They keep you movin’, keep you seein’.\n\nThirty miles on a bowl of oatmeal and a little sweat. That’s how a man lives.\n\nI live out here now, off the land, just as far from the center as some of those dorms. Best damn move I made was buyin’ a bike. Class down in Thomas Building. Twenty-five minutes on foot. Five on two wheels. \n\nBut Pollock Road… it’s a hard road, no matter how fast you spin.\n\nWalkin’, it’s got its own merits. But time, it’s a thief. And I ain’t got none to spare. Two and a half hours a week, that’s what walkin’ would cost me. Add to that the other trips, the errands, the endless to and fro.\n\nBikes, they keep you movin’. They keep you free."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "The paper concerns itself with the twin shadows of insomnia, the biological and sociocultural. The biological leans towards the hardwired, the genes inherited, the body's mechanics. It seeks the source of sleeplessness in the very marrow. The sociocultural, it casts a wider net, examining the world's pull on the mind, the threads woven through race, class, and circumstance. This review seeks to unravel both these threads, to trace the paths of research that illuminate these models, to weigh their findings against the anvil of reality. \n\nSleeplessness takes many forms. Primary, where the roots lie solely within the self. Dyssomnias, the disorders of sleep itself, where the body rebels against its call. Or Parasomnias, where the sleep landscape is twisted, dreams bleeding into waking hours. Then there are the disorders born of other ailments, mental or physical, or the poison of substance. Primary Insomnia, the inability to find rest, Primary Hypersomnia, the weight of endless slumber. Narcolepsy, the thief of control, stealing the body's strength, leaving it trembling in the wake of sleep's embrace.  \n\nThe biological model whispers of neurons, of the hypothalamus, the orexin, the conductor of sleep and wakefulness. This study, it delves into the brains of mice, their GABAB receptors, keys that unlock the gates of slumber. A flick of the switch, a manipulation of these receptors, and sleep emerges, a tide receding and returning. \n\nBut the question remains: can we extrapolate these findings to the human condition? Is this mouse a mirror held to our own souls? If so, what does it tell us?  A flaw in this receptor, a genetic quirk, could leave a man adrift in a sea of sleepless nights. And the sociocultural echoes? If this predisposition is inherited, it paints a grim picture. A child born into a world where sleep eludes them, a burden passed down through generations, hindering their every waking moment. School, work, the mundane tasks of life, all become poisoned by sleeplessness, a constant struggle against the tide.",

Then, the ways of knowing if it's there, the telltale signs. And finally, how a teacher in a room full of sound might help a child who bears this weight.\n\nCAPD, or APD, they say it's a matter of how the mind makes sense of what the ears hear. The brain, the central nervous system, can't quite do its job right. The sound gets there, clear enough, but the switching, the sorting, the making of meaning, it falters. The ears ain't the problem, it's what comes after. The soul of the hearing, they say. \n\nThey first whispered about this in the fifties, 'auditory imperception' was the name then.  Kids with troubles speaking, they thought something was amiss. Bocca, Calearo, Cassinari, testing the children in Italy. Kimura, in '61, spoke of dichotic testing, the way the brain splits the sound world.  A conference in '77, a gathering of minds, and the talk turned to this thing, this CAPD.\n\nThe signs, they come in many forms. Sound, it may not be heard right, lost in the spaces between. Words, they may blend together, indistinguishable. Patterns, unseen. Sarcasm, a change in tone, lost on the ear. One sound buries the next.  The mind, it can't weave the threads of sound into a tapestry of meaning.\n\nTo find it, they observe, they test.  Audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, they all have their tools. Questionnaires, observations, sounds presented and responses measured. No single test, no surefire sign. The cause, a mystery.

That is the question Viola wrestles with, driven by a need for survival.  \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" she says. A foreign land, a perilous journey, and the weight of her own identity cast off like a discarded coat. But the disguise takes hold, alienating her from her own kind, severing the bonds of sisterhood. \n\nAnd then there is the confusion, the tangled web of desire. Olivia, caught in the snare of Viola's fabricated masculinity, falls for the phantom, calling her \"husband.\" Orsino, the Duke, consumed by his own melancholia, finds himself drawn to the charade, confessing his love for the boy Cesario. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nThis play, it speaks of hidden desires, unveiled by the artifice. Does Olivia truly yearn for men, or does she mistake the mask for the man? Or is it a mockery of her own society, a reflection of their shallow judgments?  The truth lies somewhere in the shadows, obscured by the play's own ambiguity. Olivia, she moves from Cesario to Sebastian with a swiftness that suggests a heart easily swayed. And Viola, stripped of her disguise, is embraced as a sister, not a lover. The mask removed, the truth revealed. But at what cost?",
            "The shadow of empire fell heavy on the land. German, they called it. Brutality, a word whispered in the dust, etched in the bones of the Ovaherero, the Nama. Genocide, a stain on the sun-bleached plains of South West Africa. But empire, like the land itself, was a vast and varied thing. Policies, like the shifting sands, flowed in different currents.  Education, too, wore many faces.  East Africa, Tanganyika, taken by the British under a different sky, held a people literate, educated, their minds touched by the German hand.  Kamerun, too, bore witness to such endeavors.\n\nBut South West Africa, a land of stark contrasts, held a different story.  Here, the state, the iron fist of government, did not reach out to the native.  The task of instruction, of shaping young minds, fell to the missionaries, their churches echoing with hymns and prayers, their schools a refuge, a lifeline.  Limited, meager, the government’s support. Yet, the Europeans, the settlers who carved their names on the landscape, they were different.  State schools rose for them, their education nurtured, their futures assured.\n\nThe legacy of these policies, like the ghosts of the past, lingered. While East Africa boasted a literate citizenry, South West Africa remained cloaked in ignorance.  A vast majority, untouched, uneducated, their words lost in the wind.  What forces, what unseen hands, shaped this divergence? This paper seeks to delve into the hearts of the settlers, into the minds of the authorities, to uncover the reasons, the justifications, the justifications…\n\nThe books speak of this, written in tongues of German and English, their pages filled with narratives of education, of systems, of comparisons.  Cohen, a scholar, a seeker of truth, he wrote of South West Africa, of East Africa, drawing parallels, illuminating the differences.  He saw in the settler population, the driving force behind the divide.  \n\nSouth West Africa, a land of temperate climes, a land where even the desert held a certain beauty, it attracted the Europeans.  In 1913, nearly fifteen thousand of them walked its soil, more than any other colony save East Africa.",
            "Popular music, a sprawling, tangled thing, has grown beyond counting in these last hundred years. Genres, like roots spreading, creep and intertwine. The names alone - rap, rock, country, jazz, folk - whisper of a multitude. And within each, a thicket of subgenres, deeper still, branching out like veins in a corpse. Heavy metal, that brooding child of rock, has become a world unto itself in the last four decades. A world of noise and fury, expressing the dark corners of the soul. It ain't pretty, but it's honest. Diversified, too. Bands took the raw materials, twisted and turned them, birthing subgenres that spawned sub-subgenres, and so on, a fractal of sound echoing out into the night.\n\nNow, the metal beast has grown so vast, so many heads, it's hard to say what it truly is. It's absorbed threads from every other genre, a chameleon of sound. But every beast has a genesis. To understand the metal that bleeds out of every speaker, you gotta dig down, find that first spark. Metal ain't just a genre. It's a movement, a force of nature.\n\nDarkness is its creed. More bass, more volume, more violence. Less innocence, more goddamn skill. Metal musicians, they know their instruments like they know their own bones. And like a fever dream, it's fueled by the haze. The psychedelic boom of the seventies, it turned minds to acid, spewing forth music that was wild and strange. It was a soundtrack to the apocalypse, a reflection of the world fracturing around them. Visceral, raw, honest. Something new in a world of polished pop. And the ghosts of Romanticism, they whisper in the shadows, their darkness echoing through the decades. \n\nLyrics like these, they speak to the heart of it:\n\n*Helter Skelter*\n\nThe Beatles, they  wrote it, a glimpse into the darkness that lurked beneath the surface. A spiral, a descent, the highs and lows of a drug-fueled journey. Some say it's the first metal song, a challenge to the Stones, a declaration of their own darkness.",
            "The Surrealists, they came along later, with their strange visions of dreamscapes. But before them, there was Rousseau, painting his own dreams, real as the brushstrokes themselves. The Dream, 1910, a canvas thick with his longing. Not just a woman lost in wonder, but Rousseau’s own heart laid bare. He dreamed of being seen, of the brushstrokes earning their keep, of the whispers in polite art circles. But the world, it was a hard place. To be accepted, to be deemed worthy, did he have to mimic the ghosts of masters past? Or carve his own path, a lonely road under an unforgiving sun?\n\nThe Dream, it holds the answer, or at least a piece of it. To understand it, you gotta know his story. Born in Laval, a small town in the north, to a tinsmith with a taste for comfort. No schooling in the fine arts, just the toll booths and the dust of the road, a gabelou, they called him. Douanier, the customs man, a name he wore like a borrowed coat.  His first wife, Clémence, vanished with eight children, leaving him with a daughter, Julia, and a grief that tasted like ash. Painting, it became his refuge, his way to stitch together the torn edges of his soul.\n\nHe wasn't like the other painters, those who romanticized the peasant life. Rousseau was the peasant, his canvas a reflection of their hopes and dreams. \n\nHe hungered for acceptance, and no wonder. He started late, with no guidance, a voice crying out in a wilderness of talent. Matisse, he was already making a name, while Rousseau toiled in the shadows. To be admitted to the Artiste Français, he thought, he had to paint what they wanted, what was expected.\n\n“Matisse, he feared the ordinary,” wrote Jan Gordon, a chronicler of the age, “but Rousseau yearned for it, for a way in.”",
            "The notion of a kinship 'tween ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty, has been pondered by many a thinker. A reason, I believe, lies at the heart of it. As Keats writes, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we grasp in this life comes from the books we read or the roads we walk. Yet, ethics and aesthetics, like Keats suggests, seem to take root in us without the hand of instruction. Both are more a matter of describing than dictating. Our study of right and wrong, of beauty, is largely an attempt to unravel the why—why a canvas sings, why an act aligns with the moral compass. Not a rulebook for judgment or creation, mind you.\n\nCriticism, be it of art or morals, can never fully grasp the essence of what's good or what's beautiful. Talk of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might delve into foreground, background, contrast, the weight of history. But these things, they don't tell the whole story. When asked about a cherished work, a piece of writing that lingers, you'll often hear, \"There's just something about it,\" before the words stumble to explain. Art and morals, I reckon, they can't be fully pinned down. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way ... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how sharp the description, something transcendent remains. Ethics, I believe, has this same quality. Wittgenstein, he wrote, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It's this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, that gives art and morality their power, their connection to something beyond.\n\nMorality and art, they bind us because we experience them, not with our minds alone, but with a deeper knowing, a noumenal sense.  Literature, with its words that bleed into the soul, is especially potent. As McKean put it, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The Germany of now, a fortress nation. Strong. Bound by a blood-forged culture, from the shadow of the Alps in München to the damp stones of Kiel on the Baltic.  From Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of the land, to Dresden, a city carved from stone on the Elbe. A tapestry woven from threads of many tongues and traditions. It's no wonder, then, that this Germany, this entity, sprang not from a single seed but from a confluence of tribes, of bloodlines tangled in the mists of time.\n\nGermania. The name itself, a whisper from the past, a bone thrown to the dogs of history. Its meaning, a battlefield of scholars' ink. Tacitus, that grim chronicler, claimed it hailed from the Tungrians, a tribe that once roamed these lands before the Rhine became their battleground. A name they wore like a shield against the Gauls. Caesar, that ravenous Caesar, first etched \"Germanus\" into his annals, a word borrowed from the conquered Gauls to separate foe from friend. A distinction drawn in blood. Some say it echoed a word from the Gaulish tongue, a neighbor's name. Caesar himself, in his first chapter on the Gallic Wars, writes of these men, \"Germans... who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"\n\nOthers whisper of a different origin. A spear, the \"ger,\" wielded by these warriors. Or perhaps from the Old Irish \"garim,\" a shout, a challenge, a roar that echoed across the plains. A testament to a people who spoke loud and lived loud. \n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 testament, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" paints a picture of a people untouched, unadulterated. \"I should regard them (the Germans) as aboriginal,\" he writes, \"and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse.\" A land they held sacred,  \"a wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect.\" A land that repelled the Romans, those who sought to carve their own empire from the world.\n\nThey came to its borders, these Romans, driven by greed for its treasures. They sent out their legions, tasted the land's bounty, but ultimately, the call of Rome was too strong. They returned, leaving the Germanic tribes to their own devices, to the shaping of their own destinies.",
            "The bowl stared back. A dark abyss. Not emptiness, not quite.  Something hung there.  A presence.  Thought, if it could be called that, came and went like desert wind.  A flicker. A sigh.  The artist’s words came back, a whisper now, from years ago.  Frame it.  Simplify.  But the frame wouldn't hold.  The scene pressed in, too much, too much detail.   Picasso, he had his blues. Monet, his greens.  The Italians, a riot of color.  And me?  Me, I was drowning in brown.  This was it.  The start.  The story waiting to be told.  The work.  \n\nFingertips touched the cold porcelain.  Muscles tensed, a slow tremor running up the arm.  A will to shape, to form.  The water, a mirror, still and deep.  A shiver down the spine.  The brown thing, it resisted.  Stuck like a leech.  More water.  More swirling, more pushing.  Muscles strained, a beat of panic.  A smack.  The handle of the toilet.  A splash.  The water.  The brown thing.\n\nMop in hand.  Tie choking.  The air thick.  A message left.  A silent scream.  He thought it was art.\n\nMore water.  More stillness.  Then the hand reached for the paper.  Wrapped it around itself, a shroud.  A glove.  A second skin.\n\nThe hand dipped.  Slow.  Deep.  Like a mother reaching for her child.  But this child was not born of love.  This child was born of need.  Of desperation.",
            "They die behind the wheel. Young ones.  A confluence of things. The kind of fatal vector that lays bare the frailty of youth.  The doctors say the brain ain't full grown. Not ready for the road.  And the road, it chews up the inexperienced. More wrecks. More roll-overs. More speed. More straying from the line.  Kids their age piled in. A known fact. The California people, they did a study.  Linked the age of the passenger to the odds of a wreck. It's a dark math.\n\nThey try to hold them back.  Temporary licenses, hours clipped, no young'uns in the back.  But that ain't the answer. The truth is, the young ones, by the numbers, they ain't ready.  Not for the weight of it. Not for the risk.  The doctor Zuckerman, he says eighteen's too young. Says they crave the edge, the rush. The need for speed. It's in their blood.  Let 'em wait.  Let the fire in their belly cool a little. \n\nKeep 'em off the road. A few more years.  The numbers don't lie. The road's a hungry thing. And soon enough, the next generation will be coming. Millions of them. Ready to drive.\n\nWe could teach them.  Driver's ed.  But the wheel, no.  Not till they're older.  Let 'em get some sense in their heads.  Then a permit.  Then the hours behind the wheel.  The same hours every state's got.  California's got six hours behind the wheel and fifty with an adult.  That's the way.  Nationwide.  One law.  One rule for all.\n\nIt ain't a new idea.",
            "The Library of Congress, a repository of shadows and dust, held a cache of Edison's early films. Fifteen trick films, fragments of a forgotten time, flickered to life between 1895 and 1901. Illusions, spun from the threads of editing, danced across the screen. My study sought to map the poetics of these phantoms, to trace the ghosts of innovation that haunted their later brethren. \n\nMostly, these films were bound to the stage, trapped within the frame of a proscenium. The camera, a watchful eye, remained fixed, unmoving. Long shots and the occasional medium shot, devoid of close-ups, held sway.  A single idea, a single moment, captured in a single shot. The one-shot rule, a strict code, dictated the length, seldom exceeding a minute, a blink in the vast expanse of time.  \n\nThe stage's legacy lingered. Figures moved side to side, bound by the proscenium's invisible bars. Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, a film from the year 1900,  offered a stark example. Actors marched in and out, confined to the horizontal axis, the camera unyielding in its gaze.  No pursuit, no movement towards or away.\n\nLike phantoms on a stage, these films existed in a world of artifice. Close-ups, a language of intimacy, were absent. The audience, as in the theater, beheld the whole, framed within the proscenium's embrace.  Narrative, confined by the single shot, was sparse. The films were vaudeville in essence, a series of tricks—magic, disappearances, substitutions— fleeting moments of wonder.\n\nBut appearances can be deceiving. One conceptual shot, a single breath of the story, might be a tapestry woven from many threads. Mary, Queen of Scots, a film from 1895, offered a glimpse into this hidden world. The severed head, a phantom image, hinted at the artifice, the joins in the fabric.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline. A man of the soil. A farmer. But not just any farmer. He held fast to a creed, a vision of a republic built on the back of the land, on the sweat of honest labor.  His words, they rang out like a hammer blow, striking at the heart of government, demanding liberty, demanding freedom from the grasping hands of power. His creed, it was born of the earth, of the furrows he plowed, of the harvest he reaped. He saw the government as a blade, sharp and dangerous, capable of cutting away at the very fabric of a free man's life.\n\nHe believed the young nation held a promise, a chance to forge a new path, unburdened by the ghosts of old empires. The land, it was a canvas, and the people, the artists. They could paint a picture of self-governance, a nation where the rights of man, like the roots of a mighty oak, stood firm and unshakeable.  He saw these rights as a fragile web, interconnected, each strand dependent on the others.  If one broke, the whole tapestry frayed.\n\nBut Taylor knew the darkness within man, the hunger for power, the instinct to dominate.  He spoke of a duality, a battle that raged within every heart, a struggle between good and evil.  He believed a government must be built to withstand this storm, to hold back the tide of corruption.  He sought a government that protected property, that nurtured the land, that kept the wolves of capitalism at bay.\n\nHe called for a government of limited scope, bound by the chains of the Constitution, its powers spelled out in black and white.  He saw the danger of a sprawling, bloated government, a beast that consumed all in its path. But a simple reading of the words, he warned, was a dangerous path. The spirit, the intent, it must be understood. He looked to the Declaration of Independence, a testament to the sovereignty of the states, the foundation of their freedom.",
            "The figures, they told a story. Figure Seventeen, it showed a fall off, a sudden drop in those commuter logs come the third month. A kind of dying ember. It was disquietening to see it, hard to say why the fire went out. Winter had come to the New England campus, biting wind and snow. Fewer souls on bikes or on foot, that much was clear. And December, it was the end of the fall term, a time for books and deadlines and the frantic scramble to close out the semester. The log, it might have slipped the mind, lost in the shuffle. Then came the holidays, a season of rushing and feasting, and the campus emptied, folks scattered to their homes. Come January, the spring term began, and still the logs were scant. February, it was a mystery.\n\nThe project, it had a life of its own, a quick burst of energy at first, like a flame ignited. Then, the natural pull of the embers, a fading glow. To fight it, they put on a show, a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, a blaze of prizes and promises. It worked, the logs climbed back up. But the lesson was clear: keeping the fire burning, that's a fight. The holidays, the breaks, the natural ebb and flow of things, they all work against you.\n\nAnother thing, people and their cars. Freedom, independence, that's what they crave, woven into the fabric of this land. So carrots, they had to offer carrots. Gift cards here, a massage there, a book, a cup of coffee. It worked, but maybe more could have been done. A bicycle, a sleek hybrid, even a silent electric car, those would have been prizes worth fighting for. Maybe then the logs wouldn't have fallen so low. The prizes, they stayed the same. But what if they grew, a promise of something better, something bigger? A bicycle in December, then a hybrid in January, a whisper of an electric car in February. Maybe then, the fire wouldn't have died.",
            "The Exchange Traded Fund, or ETF, a curious construct. Like an index fund, it seeks to mirror a collection of assets, be it a market index, a commodity, or a basket of securities. Yet it moves with the quickness of a lone stock, traded on the open exchange. It offers the spread of the index, the freedom of a single share. You can sell it short, leverage its rise, buy in fractions. Its cost, a shadow compared to the mutual fund's burden. But there is a price for this agility - a commission for every trade, a toll on the path.  And there are others, whispers of danger. Can the diversification it promises truly hold, or is it a mirage? \n\nThis, then, is the question we grapple with: the ETF IHF. We dissect its heart, its ten biggest holdings, which claim dominion over 63.58% of its assets. Can these ten stand in for the whole? Do they truly capture the essence of the fund, or are they but a flawed reflection?\n\nWe examine their influence, their weight in the portfolio's rise and fall, their Beta, their return.  A portfolio built on these ten, we find, would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself. Its Beta, a measure of volatility, would be lower, a whisper in the storm.\n\nBut is this difference real, or a figment of chance? To answer, we delve deeper, measuring the standard deviation of each stock, their inherent risk, and compare it against the ETF's own.",
            "Dream-Land, one of Poe's own pronouncements, a better thing. In it, words like \"Thulé,\" whispered twice, echo back from Virgil. A place north of Britain, a rim of the known world, the Greeks called it. Virgil used it, that's certain. But a shadow falls, a more immediate source. Poe, he was drawn to the dark German tongues.\n\nThis much is said in the book, Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, by Karl J. Arndt. The two poems, he sees a kinship, a likeness in their sorrow. Poe, mimicking the German master.\n\nThe Oxford Companion speaks of Goethe, his Faust, a play in two parts, the first birthing in 1808, the second in the year of the master's own passing, 1832. Within this second part, a poem, \"The King of Thulé.\" A king, grief-stricken, his queen gone, a goblet her parting gift. He drinks, remembers, and finally, finds his solace in death. The king of Thulé, the king of Poe's dream, shadows entwined, a doppelganger of loss, a crutch of drink.\n\nFaust, translated into play by H.P. Grattan, just a year before Poe's own use of \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" \n\n\"Ultima Thule,\" whispered once in the Pit, but twice in Dream-Land, bookends of the poem. The King of Thulé, Dream-Land, companions on this dark journey. The speaker, he walks through the landscape of Thulé, a land of shades, of ghosts, of a world drained of color. It echoes the king's grief, his loneliness, the slow decay of his will.\n\nGoethe, a titan of language, a name known to Poe, if for no other reason than his admiration for Tennyson.

Say a woman, Jennifer Palmer, slips on a puddle of applesauce in a store, a place they call D&D Markets.  And say the manager, a man named Martin, he's been told twice about the mess, twice!  But he's busy with his supper, he says.  A half-hour passes, the woman falls, breaks her back. Now she wants more than just what the doctor's gonna cost her. She wants to bleed the man dry.  She wants punishment.\n\nThe judge, he ain't gonna throw her claim out just like that.  California law says a man can be made to pay more if he acted with a kind of knowing disregard for the harm he might cause.  Despicable, they call it.  Jennifer, she'll say Martin knew the applesauce was a danger, knew folks had been slipping before.  Six times, she'll say, in the year gone by.  And still he didn't clean it up.  \n\nNow, whether his actions were truly despicable, that's a tougher call.  But it's a question for a jury.  And the facts, well, they speak for themselves.

            "Four years gone now, a course in Islam taken at CBC.  The air hung thick with the smoke of argument, the question burning bright: Was Islam a religion of violence? It seems a question more urgent now than ever.  The world's eye, since that day in '01, has shifted. From the glare of hostility towards Islam, towards the extremists, to a tolerance bordering on the blind. A man named Barack Obama, a name that might have been met with scorn back then, could now stand for the highest office.  A man with a lineage entwined with the faith.\n\nThe Prophet's story, it has a pull. The facts I'd gathered, the history I'd absorbed, painted a different picture. Muhammad, the conqueror, the one who subjugated tribes, forcing them to bend the knee to his God. But the biography, it tells another tale. A man of humility, misunderstood, even. He offered his truth, and men, drawn to its light, came to him.\n\nA shadow falls over the similarities between the ministries. Jesus, the Son of Man, and Muhammad, each with their miracles. A feast multiplied from meager provisions to feed forty. It's a deliberate echo, a striving to cast Muhammad as a prophet of simple truth, needing no grand pronouncements. A fallacy, a cheap trick. It diminishes the miracle of Christ, steals his light. \n\nThe stories, they strive to prove the truth of the faith, the power of conversion.  But they whisper, they relay, they recount tales told through a veil of second, third, and fourth-hand accounts.  The truth fades, obscured, leaving behind a shadow of doubt.\n\nThe most troubling thing, the weight that settles in the gut, is the attempt to elevate Muhammad.  A man of gentleness, wisdom, and grace. But history, it tells a different story. A tale of ambition, of conquest. One wonders, if true history were known, would the faith itself be shaken? Would the edifice of belief crumble?",
            "The Word went out, spoken and carried on the wind. But the wind, it shifts. The currents of thought, they turned, leaving the man from Nazareth behind in the dust. Look back, and you’ll see the path of Christ’s flock straying, year by year, further from the shepherd’s fold. This world now, it spins faster, hungers for change, for a new dawn. The old ways cling, a brittle husk, resisting the tide. But the tide, it won’t be denied. \n\nA remembering will come, a yearning for the bone of truth buried under layers of creed and dogma.  A sifting, a searching.  Decades, maybe centuries, it will take.  But the river runs back to the source.  The clock hands will turn, one by one, stripping away the accretions, leaving bare the stark words of the man who walked the hills of Galilee.  \n\nThis wind will blow across the land, from sea to shining sea.  It will gather the faithful, not to a single flock, but to a single understanding.  The church, the institution, it will stand, a weathered sentinel, guiding the way.  Yet the flock will be thinned, the multitude of voices unified in the purity of the original song. \n\nThis is how history bends, how empires rise and fall, how darkness yields to light.  Remember the Romans, who once crushed the Christians beneath their heel? Now they kneel before the very cross they erected. Remember the chains that bound the enslaved, and the day they rose.  \n\nThis too, will come to pass.  We must learn to read the scriptures anew, not with the eye of the letter, but with the heart of the spirit.  \n\nFor before Jesus came, there was only the echo of the One true God.

He'd take a word, a thing, and pair it with something else, something it don't rightly belong with, and suddenly, you see it in a new light. He did this with colors, too. Gold, green, white, gray, red, pink. He'd stain them with meaning, make them hum with a certain resonance, then he'd fling them back at you, these colors, to remind you of what he wanted you to feel about something.

Even the party, when Nick is trying to get a handle on it, there's a break from the white, a burst of gaudy color. But the white comes back, a constant, a tide.  He sees it in the buildings, the names on a list, even the way the people move through the city. It's everywhere.\n\nThen, when you think you've got it figured out, he takes the white and the gray and he leans in close, and he shows you Daisy. And she's lost in the white again, a ghost in a little white roadster. Not a woman, not really. Just a thing he wants, a white dream. And the gray, it creeps in around her too, a haze of fur, a whisper of forgotten things.  He's making a point, you see. Daisy isn't just a woman. She's a symbol, a reflection of something deeper, something that's already gone.",
            "The sun-scorched earth of San Diego County yields bounty. Tomatoes plump beneath the endless sky, citrus trees groan with fruit, and the land whispers its secrets in the rustle of leafy greens and the scent of ripe squash and the bitter bite of pepper. They say the people here hunger for this earth, for the taste of what grows free from the taint of chemicals. Organic. A word whispered like a prayer in the marketplace, where long lines snake past tables piled high with eggs and milk from contented cows. Farther out, beyond the clamor, the farms stand silent, offering more than just sustenance. There, on these sun-baked acres, you might find a man with calloused hands and eyes that hold the wisdom of the soil, offering tours through the rows of plants and the fields where birds sing their silent songs. This, they say, is the way. A way to feed the soul and the body, to walk the path of the earth and leave it richer for your passing.\n\nBut the path is not always easy. The earth demands respect, a constant vigilance against the pests that gnaw and the weeds that choke. The hands that toil are weary, the back aches with the burden of labor. The yields may come smaller, the losses heavier, but the reward lies in the whispers of the wind through the trees, the dance of the butterflies, the symphony of life that blooms in the absence of poison.\n\nThis land, this parcel of chaparral and oak woodland, sits heavy with history. It has known the touch of ancient people, the rumble of cattle hooves, the silence of forgotten dreams. It is a place where the whispers of the past mingle with the cries of the present, a tapestry woven from the threads of time. Here, in the shadow of the Cleveland National Forest, the land and the people stand at a crossroads. They say there are programs, whispers of assistance, to help those who choose this path, to help them find balance, to heal the land and themselves. But the burden of choice rests on their shoulders, a heavy weight in the hands of a farmer who seeks both profit and peace.",
            "The land of culture, it ain't a clear path. It's more like a tangled thicket, shadows and sunlight mingling. You can't grasp it whole, can't pin it down.  Sayin' all Russians are stubborn, all Japanese accommodating, that's like trying to paint a whole sky with a single brushstroke. Too broad, too quick. \n\nYou gotta learn the rhythm of the place, the music it plays. How it whispers in the wind, how it echoes in the heart. A man walkin' into a foreign land sees it through the lens of his own, comparisons bloomin' up like weeds. \n\nUnderstanding another's way, that's a journey.  You gotta pore over their histories, their scars and their stories. But don't go in to judge or change it. Just breathe it in, feel its weight. Work within its lines, especially if you're standin' at a disadvantage. Out there, respect's your only shield against the unknown.\n\nCulture ain't just about borders, it's a web woven tight.  Even within a nation, companies build their own little worlds.  Some run on long days and hard labor, others on a more leisurely pace.  Look at their clothes, how they speak, who they trust.  It's all there, writ in the lines of their faces, the way they move.\n\nValues, now those are the heart of the matter. They tell you why a culture ticks.  If shame is a heavy weight, a man won't risk it for a deal. If hardship is a badge of honor, he'll fight tooth and nail.\n\nBefore you sit at the table, you gotta know these things. But even then, learn the man across from you.  Find the threads that bind, the common ground. That's where the real bargainin' begins.",
            "The fool, he'd say in his heart, \"No God.\"  Psalm 14, the Book of Psalms, says so. And Anselm, the holy man, he built his case on those words.  The same God, the God of the Covenant, is the God that Aquinas spoke of too.  So we'll assume they both knew him, this God, the one from the scriptures. Otherwise, comparing their arguments would be like comparing apples to... well, something else entirely.\n\nNow, both men, they had their points. But neither, not really, gave us a whole picture. A complete grounding for belief.\n\nTake Anselm first.  He looked inward, to the soul. He said, to understand God, you have to look within. For if you can conceive of God, you can't conceive of him not being. It's a tangled path, this one, his words sometimes hard to follow. But the heart of it is this: God is known through the knowing itself. He's within us already. No need for signs or wonders, just the sureness of what we know. Faith, they call it.\n\nAquinas, he was different.  He sought proof in the world, in the things we can see and touch.  No faith needed, he said, just reason.  Five arguments he laid out, each one a building block. Change, cause, chance, degrees of perfection, and the harmony of the universe.  He said, if you see a puzzle missing a piece, you know it's there, even if you can't see it. The logic of it demands it.",
            "The man they called Buddha was born, somewhere in the shadow of that long ago century, fifth or sixth. A prince, he cast aside the world, sought the silence within. His words took root and grew, flowering into the faith of Buddhism, a tendril of which was known as Theravada. Five hundred years have turned since his passing, and the tendrils have stretched, taken on new forms. In Sri Lanka, where the Theravada roots run deep, they hold a ceremony, cutting water. Monks and the lay folk alike gather, a ritual born not of Buddha's own hand but of time and change. The differences, they run deep, from the surface of things to the heart of the matter. Both monk and layman, bound by the faith, have had to shift, to bend the ancient doctrines to the wind. Forces, both dark and light, have pressed upon them.\n\nThere are words we'll be using, words to guide us through this tangled wood. Internal, external. The internal is born of the followers of the Buddha's path, whether robed or not. The external, from those who walk a different road. Hostile, a force that seeks to wound the faith, to twist and break its branches. Benign, a force that means neither harm nor good, but which may bring one or the other in its wake. These words, they will echo through these pages.\n\nFirst, let us speak of the core. The doctrines that bind the Theravada heart. They seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma, it is the Tripitaka, the three baskets of wisdom. Suttas, Vinaya, Abhidhamma. The Suttas, the words of the Buddha. The Vinaya, the rules of conduct, the path laid out for both monk and layman. The Abhidhamma, the metaphysics, the nature of being. The teachings of no-self, of suffering, of impermanence. These are the truths that bind and break the wheel of Samsara, the endless turning of birth and death. Desire, hatred, delusion, all fade when the light of enlightenment breaks through. In the Vinaya, the rules are laid out, five for the layman, a shield against harm: no killing, no lying, no stealing, no unchastity, no intoxication. For the monk, the path is longer, the rules more intricate. But at the heart, the four noble truths remain: the truth of suffering, the truth of its cause, the truth of its cessation, the truth of the path that leads to it.",
            "The two nations, the United States and Mexico, were once bound by a rivalry that stretched like a long, lean shadow, fifty-seven years from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The high tide of this animosity crested in the Mexican-American War, a conflict of 1846-1848 where the United States, in a swift and brutal reckoning, subdued Mexico. Texas and the Southwest fell into American hands, wounds fresh and festering.  \n\nBut this was only the storm's eye. Smaller skirmishes, like brush fires, flared between the two nations, finally dying down in the hushed stillness before the First World War.  The roots of their discord ran deep, tangled in religion, culture, and the tangled web of material interests. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dance of rivalry is not unfamiliar. Nations that share a border, their fates intertwined, often find themselves locked in a struggle for dominance, a tug-of-war over land and resources.  The United States and Mexico are but one example among many.  David M. Pletcher (1977) wrote, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both nations, geographically close, have stood in opposition to American expansion, while others in Latin America have found more fertile ground for cooperation.\n\nReligion, a potent and divisive force, also cast a dark shadow over their relationship. Sally Frahm (2001) points out, \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Like the Cold War, a battle fought not just on battlefields but in the minds of men, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was fueled by a clash of ideologies, albeit ones rooted in faith, not politics.  This distrust, inherited from the old empires, the English and the Spanish, proved a formidable barrier to any hope of lasting peace.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalogued seventeen disputes between the two nations during that fifty-seven year period. Most were skirmishes over territory, border raids, and the ever-present threat of violence at the frontier.  Bandits and outlaws, like wolves on the prowl, preyed on both sides of the border, their presence a constant reminder of the volatile tension. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to wane as Mexico, caught in the grip of need, leaned heavily on the United States for support.  (p. 109)  In the dying embers of the nineteenth century, American ambitions shifted from territorial conquest to a more insidious form of control: economic intervention in Mexico. (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years gone now.  A sudden sickness, a fate unseen. It took hold like a fever, stole my strength, left me hollowed out. A nurse I was, back then. The steady work, the comfort of the sickbed, a shield against the ghosts of a childhood too harsh. \"Always a need,\" they'd say, \"for hands that mend. People will always be broken.\" So I built my life on that promise.  Science, journalism, those were the dreams, buried deep. But the need was stronger.\n\nForty-six years, alone, with nothing but dust in the bank. The years crawl on, fifteen of them, stretched thin on a government's meager grace. My own, I own nothing.  A hand-to-mouth existence, each day a battle against the gnawing fear, the hollow ache of what might have been. Nothing certain but the cold grip of need. Yet through it all, a truth remains. Family, friends, a lifeline thrown.  They held me steady when the world spun. And believe this, in the face of true ruin, you find out just how empty your strength is.\n\nLife, it throws its storms. Big and small, they come without warning. No map, no guide.  We can preach preparedness, build our bunkers, but some things are too vast, too cruel.\n\nThey say we must cut our ties with the government, its ship run aground.  But what good is a lone island when the sea is rising?  I say, let us learn to trust again, to build bridges, to share the burden. Our forefathers, they didn't conquer hardship alone. It was compassion, respect, the sharing of what little they had that saw them through. The wagons trains, they rolled westward on shared hope, not rugged defiance.\n\nBe ready, yes, I am.  Water purification, canned goods, a first-aid kit, the tools to weather the storm.   A wood stove, a garden if you have the land. But alongside these things,  reach out. Know your neighbor, their story, their struggles. For in the end, it is the bonds we weave that will endure.",
            "The question of form, of how life takes shape, has haunted the minds of men since time immemorial.  Why do these creatures twist and turn, these shells, these bones, into the patterns they do? Are there invisible threads guiding them, unseen constraints upon their becoming?  Even now, the naturalist barely scratches the surface, struggling to capture the essence of creation in the cold logic of numbers.  Yet men have tried.  They have sought to quantify the dance of the whorls, to map the spiral path of growth in these mollusk shells, these Prunum.  \n\nThey speak of mathematical models, of software that can conjure forms, and they delve into the past, tracing the lineage of these shells through the eons. They peer into the heart of the shell, the columella, that central thread through which the whorls unfurl.  They count the turns, the sutures that bind them, the aperture that breathes life into the empty form.  And they seek to understand, to unravel the mystery of how these silent creatures, these Prunum, have shaped themselves through the endless passage of time. \n\nThey speak of the shell as a journey, a pilgrimage through space and time, a spiral path etched into the fabric of existence.  They see the apex, the starting point, the base where it rests.  They trace the path of the aperture, the opening through which life itself emerges.  They try to capture the essence of this journey, to translate it into language the mind can grasp.  \n\nAnd perhaps, just perhaps, they will find the answer.",
            "The death of infants and newborns in this land of Java and Sumatra, it has hung steady these last ten years.  The country aims for the promised moons of those Millennium Declarations, clean water and the like, but the children and their mothers, they fall short.  The reasons for this failing are many, and lie not in the programs themselves, but in the bones of the system.\n\nThey boast of births attended by learned hands, 72% they say, but these hands are not always of the doctor. Midwives, women of the village, they attend, but no knife to staunch a hemorrhage, no scales to weigh the fading life.  So the mothers bleed out, a silent toll.\n\nThe children, too, they suffer.  Diarrhea, a scourge of the young, treated less and less by those with skill.  And the care after birth, a shadow, a whisper, lacking for the mother and child alike.\n\nThe steel cuts, the cesarean, a rare thing here.  4% maybe, a whisper compared to the cities where it's 7%.  The knife, a luxury for the city dweller, a phantom for the farmer.  And the poor, they are forgotten, the line between rich and poor a chasm.  27%, they say, the difference in care.  The cost of healing, a wall too high for them to climb.\n\nSo what then, the question hangs, a shroud over the land.  Programs, they offer, quick fixes, but at what cost?  One hand reaches for the child, the other forgets the mother.  Resources diverted, like ants swarming a dropped crumb, leaving the rest to wither.",
            "The Victorian age, a time of suffocating detail and endless pronouncements on the station of the titled. Yet even in that gilded cage, shadows stirred.  Two novels, *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, claw at the edges of this tradition, venturing into the realm of the uncanny. Both weave a tapestry of mystery, a hint of the perverse, a dissonance that resonates through the characters, illuminating their motives, their buried grief.  \n\nConsider this passage from Dickens: \n\n>“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nA fever dream, a descent into chaos. These novels, they use this disquiet often, in dreams, in visions, though the purpose shifts with each turn. In *Oliver Twist*, these phantoms delve into the boy's own wounded soul, revealing the ache within, the recognition of a world turned cruel. When the shooting finally returns, in chapter 28, it's a reliving, a reenactment, as if through a fogged glass.  He seeks help, but the world spins, the hand of fate a cold, unseen thing.  The senses are numb, the pain a constant ache, a companion to the fear.  Whose will brought this down upon him? Not his own, not in this maelstrom. A sense of defeat creeps in, a hardening of the spirit, as if Fagin's darkness has begun to seep into him, a poison that numbs the will to resist.\n\nAnd again, from *Wuthering Heights*:\n\n>“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "Two years back I was working the after-school shift, tutoring the small ones. English and reading, that's where my own light shone brightest. They sent me a boy named Adrian. Third or fourth grade, maybe. Trouble reading, he was.  Something off about it, the way he struggled. Some letters, clear as day. Others, not a lick of sense. Like a broken clock, telling different times.  He spoke English right good, this boy, though. Latino, that much was plain. \n\nThen came the day I was left holding the fort while the rest of the kids were gone on some outing. Adrian's mother walked in. Not a word of English passed her lips, just Spanish. My own Spanish, well, it was threadbare, a learner's tongue. But we managed. Then it hit me, like a stone dropped from a height. Adrian, he could read fine. It was just the alphabet he didn't know.  English letters, strange to him. Don't know if it helped much, but I hope the boy's doing better now. \n\nI tell this story, because the language gap in these schools, it's a damn canyon.  Especially here in California. And it ain't always so clear cut. A kid speaking English perfect might still struggle. Reading, it can be a hard birth. \n\nAdrian, his problem was simple:  English reading, the alphabet, the sounds.  But for the kids barely speaking English, it's a heavier load. No single answer, no magic bullet. Dual language, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of it solves it alone.  It takes everything, all mixed together.\n\nDual language, it ain't just for Spanish speakers. For all the kids. They say it's a waste, that it won't help the majority. Lies. Make it the rule, not the exception, and everyone benefits. But how? Every teacher bilingual? Unrealistic.  But maybe, just maybe, some helpers, aides, whatever you call 'em, who speak both tongues.",
            "The world tells you from the start there's somethin' bigger. Somethin' vast. Unreckonable. They send you to pews or temples or they tell you to find it in the dark corners of your own skull. Most swallow it whole, the stories passed down like worn rosary beads. But some, they spit it out.  Say there's nothin' but the skin of your own world.  They build their own gods, their own cages.  And the path? It twists and turns, searchin' for some light in the goddamn dark. \n\n\"A cardinal,\" my pa said, when I asked him what bird he liked best. We were on the porch, rain drummin' on the tin roof, stink of wet earth and smoke in the air.  He was lookin' out at the water runnin' from the gutters, drownin' the plants.  His eyes, they were lost, half-rememberin', half-searchin'.  He'd thinned out, his clothes hangin' like rags.  Hair scraggly, like the last tendrils of a winter storm. He didn't look at me. Couldn't.  I felt it, the lonesome pull, the fear. Couldn't speak it, not out loud.  'Cause sayin' it would make it real. So I hugged him, pulled my chair closer, and watched the rain with him, the sky bleedin' purple and gray.\n\nHe died in December, five days after my twenty-second year.  Chemo and radiation, they kept him breathin', but nothin' eased the burnin'.  A few more months, they said.  What good that was, I couldn't say.  What kind of God would do that?  Layin' there in the dark, no prayers came. If He was listenin', He stopped a long time ago.\n\nDidn't want to watch him go.  Didn't want to see the light fade from his eyes.  Wanted to hold him in the way he was, not the way he wasn't.  Knew him better than anyone else.  He wouldn't have wanted me there, watchin' the end.  Curled up tight in my bed, waitin' for the news.\n\nThey didn't call.",
            "The Gothic, a name that sings of contradiction, an oxymoron for \"Old-New\" as Watt declared. Praised and damned, mocked and lauded for its glimpse of the terrible sublime -  a dance with darkness. Walpole, he who birthed the beast with his *Castle of Otranto*, wove threads of ancient romance and the newfangled novel. An echo of the stage, a mimicry of nature, a \"Gothic Story,\" he called it.  He drew upon the bones of Gothic theatre, its architecture, its lore. A tattered word, \"Gothic,\" flung against epochs and peoples, marked archaic, unsophisticated. Yet, in its shadow, a new light flickered. The intimacy of the novel, the peering into the soul of man, gave the Gothic a strange life, a timeless resonance. \n\nAnd from the ashes of chivalry arose a specter. The medieval knight, brave, honorable, competent, a fading ideal in the eyes of the writers, especially Walpole. They saw a world gone soft, a world lacking the steel of the past. Chivalry, they held, was the cure, a balm for the wounds of modernity.  The \"gothic past\" shimmered, romanticized, a promise of what might have been. Walpole, caught in the maelstrom of politics, a man unjustly accused, saw this decay. Did he yearn for a simpler time, for the supposed virtue of a bygone age? \n\nFrederic, his prince, a figure sculpted from chivalric dreams. He was a prince, yes, marked by suffering, touched by tragedy. \"Gallant,\" \"courteous,\" a knight raised to an impossible height, a trope echoing through the ages. An exaggeration, a hint of the Gothic excess to come.",
            "The movement of goods, a river of commerce, flows from the customer's want to the raw earth itself. From there it spills through the channels of supply, production, and distribution, finally reaching the waiting hands of its maker. This river, this chain, was given its name in the year of '82 by a man named Keith Oliver, a consultant who saw the need for order in the chaos. He spoke of planning, of wielding control over this flow, of making it swift and sure, all to satisfy the hunger of the customer.  \n\nSix pillars hold this chain aloft. Production, supply, the hoard of inventory, the choice of place, the rumble of transport, and the whispers of information.  These are the tools the manager wields, shaping the river to serve the needs of the consumer.\n\nProduction, the first and most vital link. Here the ground is broken, the earth yielded. It is the heart of the chain, beating with the rhythm of want and need. The manager must know what the customer desires, what whispers on the wind of the marketplace. The market, a vast and shifting sea, holds the answers. Through its currents, the manager discerns the demands, the call for this or that.  Then comes the decision: what shall be made, and in what quantity? The manager, with a keen eye, chooses the place of creation, the factory that will best serve both volume and quality, the place where the river will flow truest.  Finally, the manager sets the pace of work, the maintenance of the machinery, for every detail here is etched in stone, every misstep a cost in time and coin. For I have seen the wheels grind to a halt, the river choked, in the face of carelessness.\n\nSupply, the second pillar. It speaks of strategy, of forging alliances and choosing partners. A single product may have many faces, many divisions, each with its own tools, its own workers, its own mastery. The manager must decide where each piece fits, where each thread is woven. And sometimes, the manager chooses to yield, to outsource, to let another hand shape the clay. This is done for velocity, for the swiftness with which goods are made and delivered, for the flexibility to adapt, and for the ever-present need to keep the cost low, the river flowing clear.",
            "The sign, a scrap of cardboard held aloft, spoke of things best left unsaid.  \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it declared in a scrawling hand, the ink bleeding into the fibers like a dying man's blood.  Ellen Page, face pale and drawn under the harsh glare of the streetlamps, stood alone.  \n\nBurma. A place name that tasted of dust and sorrow. A land ruled by men with iron fists and eyes as black as the crows that circled above the jade-green rice paddies. A junta, they called them, these men who seized power in a whirlwind of bullets and betrayal. Since '62, the year the world shifted on its axis, Burma had been a country choked by silence. Until the Saffron Revolution. Monks, their robes the color of dying embers, rose up, their chanting a challenge to the storm clouds gathering over the land.  \n\nThe government, a viper coiled in its own poison, allowed the protests at first, a cruel amusement. But the whispers grew louder, the crowds swelled. The viper struck. Monasteries, havens of peace, were overrun, their sacred halls echoing with the cries of the fallen. Foreign eyes, seeking the truth, were dragged into the darkness, their lenses forever capturing the horror. Kenji Nagai, a man who dared to witness, paid the ultimate price. \n\nOne thousand, they said. Three thousand, whispered the wind. But the Colonel, a shadow escaping the viper's coils, spoke of a number too terrible to utter. \n\nThis, this was not new. The hunger for power, the thirst for control, it was a disease that festered in the heart of men. The Caesars, draped in their purple robes, claimed to be chosen by the gods, their will absolute. The emperors of Japan, shrouded in myth and whispered prayers, believed themselves divine. And here, in the land of the free, a man named Bush, his face a mask of piety, sought counsel from a man called Haggard, a shepherd of souls steeped in the darkness of the abyss.  \n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity yearning for freedom, met with the cold steel of tanks. June 4th, a date etched in blood. The official count, a lie whispered by the wind. In Rwanda, the jungle ran red with the blood of innocents, the cries of the slaughtered swallowed by the silence of the world. And the Third Reich, a testament to the depths of human depravity, where the stench of death lingered long after the ashes had settled.  \n\nThe world, a tapestry woven with threads of light and darkness, turned its gaze away. But the truth, like a wound that never heals, remained.",
            "Duke Ellington. A name that hangs heavy in the air of jazz. His legacy's woven from the thread of years, spun long and taut. It's in the shaping of his orchestra, his hand upon the keys a whisper, a guide. His compositions, they breathe with a richness, a complexity, showcasing the bones and sinew of each man in the band.  \n\nHe built a framework, a cage of sound where souls could soar, improvise.  Tightly woven phrases, orchestrated, demanding the particular grace of each player, each note a brushstroke on a canvas of sound.  He coaxed the tone of the whole, birthing something new, something singular. A testament to the music itself.\n\nThe Grove, that book of hushed pronouncements, speaks of Ellington's sound, his daring. \"Creole Love Call,\" they say, using the voice as an instrument. A threadbare blues, twelve bars, six choruses, each one a different shade of the same sorrow. The voice, it starts smooth, a lover's caress, then rasps, a plea from the abyss. The trumpet, muted, a sigh, a lament, reaching for notes beyond the ordinary. The clarinet, a cry, soaring, lost in a sea of syncopated piano. The brass, the reeds, they echo, they answer.  A crescendo, a final chorus, a voice now a growl, a beast unleashed. A trombone, a final discordant wail, a question unanswered.\n\nAnd the voice, always the voice. A color, a texture, a thing apart. A tool, a weapon, a mirror held up to the soul. This is Ellington's voice, his touch, his lasting legacy. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" the trumpet and the scat, a conversation in tongues. A dance between instrument and voice, each borrowing from the other, a tapestry of sound. And in \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" the trombone, a mournful cry, introducing the melody, a single voice in a wilderness of sound.",
            "The need had always been there. A gnawing, unfillable thing. It began when she was fourteen, a girl on the cusp, and had followed her into the hollow of seventeen. Now she knew it wasn't a thing she craved, but someone. Yet no boy had stirred within her the faintest flicker of interest. Some had tried, stumbling through the clumsy rites of courtship, but they were all strangers, passing shadows.  She questioned herself often, this emptiness a vast and echoing canyon of her own making. Theories formed and dissolved like mist. Nothing concrete, nothing that could satiate the ache. So she lived, adrift in a sea of unanswered questions.\n\nDays at home were usually quiet. Her parents, good people, lived in a rhythm of gentle calm. Their words were seldom sharp, their voices never raised. They argued, rarely, only over her insistence on charting her own course, her vibrant spirit a counterpoint to their measured lives. She was their daughter, yet she was a storm in their stillness, a bright flame in their quiet hearth.\n\nBut today, the air hung thick and heavy. As she wandered, searching for inspiration, a cry tore through the stillness. Her mother's voice, thin and sharp as broken glass. Panic seized her. \"Mom? What is it?\"\n\nShe found her mother sprawled on the kitchen floor, her face etched with pain. \"Ow,\" she gasped, each word a shard of agony. \n\nHer daughter knelt beside her, a hand trembling on her mother's arm. \"Sweetheart, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were squeezed out, each syllable a battle.\n\n\"Okay, Mom,\" she said, her voice tight. \"Where should I meet you?\"\n\nHer mother pointed, her hand trembling. Relief washed over her daughter, gratitude for the strength she had built. She lifted her mother, careful, sure, and carried her to the car. \n\nThe hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear. But fear was a distant whisper compared to the urgency that pulsed through her. She carried her mother inside, her voice a desperate plea for help. \n\nDoctors materialized, faces creased with concern. A gurney appeared, a silent promise of care. They took her mother away, leaving her daughter adrift in a sea of worry.\n\nThe truth, when it came, was simple. A stepping stool, a vase too high, a moment of clumsy grace. It could have been worse.",
            "This study, a reckoning with the ways of heart and blood, sought to prove the claim: that a life lived by the tenets of the Mediterranean Diet, as measured by a score given to the adherence, the so-called 'alternate Mediterranean' or aMed score, would stave off the cruel grip of chronic heart disease and the sudden stroke. This aMed way, a variant of the older Mediterranean ways, calls for the bounty of the earth: plants in their fullness, proteins from the soil and the tree, fat from the olive and the nut, fish from the deep. It calls for a measured hand with animal flesh and the fats that clog the vessels. And it allows, sparingly, for the comfort of wine.\n\nOld studies, like whispers in the wind, had spoken of a link between the Mediterranean way and a lessening of heart's peril, both in life and in death. One trial, a controlled test of will, showed the Mediterranean way more potent than a diet of meagerness in shedding weight and clearing the blood's pathways. But these whispers had not addressed the specter of stroke, nor the shadow of its passing.\n\nThis study, a vigil over seventy-four thousand women, their years between thirty-eight and sixty-three, followed them through two decades, from 1984 to 2004. These women, nurses in the service of health, were part of a larger cohort, a thousand souls strong, scattered across eleven states. Six times, the researchers measured their adherence to the aMed ways through written accounts of their meals, these 'food frequency questionnaires' or FFQs. Over ninety-five percent of these women kept to their pact, their records a testament to their commitment. These accounts, scrutinized and tested, were cross-referenced with the cold records of hospitals and death certificates, seeking truth in the face of mortality.\n\nThe researchers, seeking to banish the ghosts of chance, averaged the aMed scores, smoothing out the peaks and valleys of individual variation. They adjusted for the shadows that could skew the results: age, the habit of smoke, the weight of the body, the state of womanhood, the use of hormones, the intake of vitamins, the solace of wine, the rhythm of physical activity, and the shield of aspirin.\n\nThen, with the tools of statistics, they measured the link between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models to dissect the fatal and the non-fatal.\n\nThe findings were clear: those who lived closer to the aMed ways, with higher scores, faced a lower risk of these afflictions.  Over twenty years, the researchers catalogued a thousand deaths from heart disease, a thousand strokes, and over a thousand deaths from these combined evils. The women at the pinnacle of the aMed scale stood a third less likely to suffer these fates compared to those at the bottom.",
            "The year was two thousand and seven. The bones of the American dream had begun to rattle. A sickness had taken hold, spreading through the veins of the nation. Banks, bloated and gorged on easy credit, stood stripped bare. Houses, once symbols of prosperity, now stood vacant, monuments to a folly. The weight of debt, a shroud, settled upon the land.\n\nThey say it was a storm brewing for years. The whispers began in the Clinton years, when the promise of easy money and a second term twisted the hand of policy. Lending was loosened, a reckless act that loosened the very fabric of the financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, twin pillars of the housing market, were pressured to repackage these risky loans, churning them into securities and selling them off like poisoned fruit.\n\nThe market, drunk on greed, swallowed them whole. But the hangover came swift and brutal. When the piper demanded payment, the borrowers were gone, vanished like smoke in the wind. The banks, hollowed out, had no cushion, no backstop. The rot spread, consuming the very heart of the economy. Lehman Brothers, a titan of finance, crumbled to dust. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold off in fire sales. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, their faces pallid with fear, were forced to bend the knee to the government.\n\nThe scars remain. A generation scarred by a crisis born of hubris and avarice. And the question lingers, a bitter taste in the mouth: What lessons were learned? Were any? Or will we, like moths to a flame, be drawn to the same folly once more?",
            "Ah, exposition. The place in the telling where the writer stretches his wings, or maybe just flaps them a while before the wind catches him up and carries him away. Or  maybe he just falls out of the sky.  Dr. Merlin, she's been known to let out a howl at the screen when she finds herself drowning in too much of the telling. Not the good kind of drowning, neither.\n\nExposition ain't your friend.\n\nThey say, show, don't tell. But Dr. Merlin, she still stumbles into these long stretches of words where nothin' happens, or worse, too much. Like a hound dog baying at the moon. Exposition, it's that devil on your shoulder whispering to get it all out in the open, get the past laid bare, before you get to the good parts. Don't get me wrong, the other devil whispers too, the one urging you to lay out every detail of every life, every scar and every dream.\n\nExposition, it's the author doing the telling. Like a sailor reciting a long ballad, the old mariners' tale, pouring out the whole damn history. In a story, it's the author's voice that drowns you in it.\n\nTake for instance, a story you're reading. You're told the heroine met her man, they wed with a flourish, and then he's gone, murdered right before her eyes. You ain't gonna want to read two pages of that, are you? Two whole pages of telling, with nothin' but two lines of dialogue from each character.\n\nYou want to see the husband, feel him, hear his words, see the love in his eyes. You want to see how the heroine changes when he comes into her life, how she blossoms under his gaze.  Show me the man, show me the woman, and then show me the tragedy.\n\nGive me meat on the bone, that's what I'm saying. Show me the man, show me the woman, and show me the bone they're both hung on.\n\nThere's a temptation to rush past things. You got a new character, maybe he was in the Air Force, now he pumps gas at night, twice-married, no kids, fishes on weekends. He dreams of owning the station someday. Ate Eggs Benedict for breakfast. That's a whole life right there, but you gotta show me, don't just tell me.",
            "The flickering screen coughed up two dispatches from Columbus. First, NBC 4, their faces pale and strained, spoke of a man named Shad Hostettler, a shadow cast in a mug shot, and his deeds in Ashley. A wife, nameless, stabbed multiple times. Two minutes, maybe, before they moved on. Evil, plain as day in his eyes. \n\nThen, a whisper of a story. Travis Buyers, eighteen, shot in the woods. No arrests, no names. The SWAT Team prowled. The briefness of it stung.  Black boy, shot down. A familiar ache. They don't linger on these things, not like the white boy missing, the white girl snatched.  \n\nThe Med-Flight chopper, a hole in its side, a .22 rifle bullet. A whisper of five thousand dollars for whispers. \n\nThunder promised, the weekend hot. A tease.  \n\nA robbery, a UDF on Clime Road. A man, dark-skinned, a hoodie pulled low. Six feet, a hundred and fifty pounds.  They lingered on the darkness of his skin, a stain.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a name from Texas, a kingpin of weed.  Three hundred months they said. Not twenty-five years, no. Three hundred.  Hispanic, they added, though the words felt misplaced.",
            "The tie between brothers. It's a thing woven deep, unyielding. A tangled skein of feeling: love, pride, envy, the dark blood of malice. They know each other like the lines on their own hand. See themselves looking back, a ghost in the mirror. This bond it shows its face in the dark, in the teeth of the storm. Good or bad.  The price you pay for knowing these things, the weight of it all, that's the burden. To see your own face in your brother's eyes, not the mask you show the world, but the raw truth, the bone beneath. In that looking glass, in the deeds and the dust they leave behind, lies the man. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys walk this path, a journey etched against the green and humid air.  A boy and his brother, bound together by blood and shadow. Pride, bitter and sharp, and the sun-soaked ache of love, clash in the end. Only one walks away from the wreckage. The story tells it through the voice of the boy, the brother who walks the tightrope between light and dark. His words paint the world and the boy  with the scarlet ibis, both dying things, both beautiful in their fragility. \n\nThe boy, he's driven by pride, a hunger in his soul. From the first time they walk together, through the swamp and the sun-drenched fields, he sees not a brother, but a reflection of his own desires. He wants a brother to match his steps, to run and climb, to share the secrets of the world. He wants a brother who can keep pace. But Doodle, he's different. Born weak, a fragile bird with a heart that struggles to beat.  The boy's dreams, they shatter like glass. He feels anger, a dark bloom in his chest. He thinks of ending it all, of smothering the boy in the night. But then, a smile. A flicker of light in the darkness. The boy, he hesitates. Maybe the love, maybe the blood, maybe something in the boy's eyes, it keeps him from the edge.",
            "The mind, a dark and tangled thicket. Men have tried to chart its depths with metaphors, first a blank slate, then a scroll, a book, and now, this cold, metallic notion of a machine. But these are but shadows cast on a wall.  \n\nInput. The senses bleed into the world, a flood of heat and light and sound, transmuted into whispers the brain can understand. These signals, they weave through circuits, a tapestry of bottom-up and top-down, like threads pulled tight and then slack. See a box, black against white. The brain stitches together edges, color, shape, a simple picture made whole. But then, the shadows speak. Is it a box, or a void, a hole in the white? The mind knows. It sifts and sorts.\n\nAttention, a fragile thing, a spotlight in the dark. It chooses what to hold fast, what to let drift away. A field of grass, a blur beneath the feet. A name spoken, a sudden clarity. The mind filters, a sieve in the storm.\n\nMemory, a whisper in the wind. Sensory echoes, fleeting as a breath. Working memory, a flickering flame, a loop of light in the neural dark. Long-term, a stone archway, carved from the very fabric of being. Words, they etch themselves into the mind, structural, sonic, and meaning.\n\nKnowledge, a spider web spun across the brain. Connections, fragile and strong, a web of meaning. A chair, a table, wood. The mind weaves, a tapestry of thought, a mirror reflecting the world and its own shadowy depths.",
            "The world Huxley paints in *Brave New World* is a bleached canvas, airbrushed clean of individuality. Technology, a gleaming blade, cuts down the forest of the human spirit. And what remains? A hollow, echoing chamber of consumerism, enforced by a gilded cage of capital.\n\nCommunity, they say. But it's a community of the lobotomized, their minds pre-programmed to chase the phantoms of instant gratification. They are the pawns, dancing to the tune of the World Controller, their strings pulled by the unseen hand of a system built on illusion.\n\nThe echoes of Marx whisper through the pages. Homogeny, reification, these are the tools of the master, shaping the worker into a cog in the machine. Huxley, through his keen eye, sees the tendrils of this new economy wrapping tight around the human soul.\n\nHe calls it false consciousness. The masses, blinded by their own desires, are kept ignorant of the true relations of power. They chase trinkets and pleasures, their minds numbed by the hypnotic hum of consumption. The Delta, the Gamma, they are the shadows, dancing to the tune of the World Controller's flute. \n\nHegemony, a suffocating shroud, blankets the world. The upper classes, born into their gilded cages, see the truth but choose to remain complicit. They are the shepherds, guiding the flock to the slaughterhouse of their own contentment.  \n\nAnd love? That flickering flame of the human heart is extinguished in this sterile landscape. Relationships are transactional, devoid of depth or meaning.  Men speak of women in terms of their physical attributes, like machines to be used and discarded. \n\nHuxley's world is a warning. A glimpse into a future where technology and capitalism, unchecked, will leave us hollow shells, our souls devoured by the insatiable maw of the system.",
            "The stone walls of these halls had held me for two and a half years, four and a half semesters. Getting ‘round this place, it was a chore like hauling water up a dry well. Freshman year, they stuck me in the East Halls, out past the stadium, past the Jordan Center, near the edge of the world. Willard Building. To get there, from that godforsaken corner, it took a good twenty minutes, feet eatin’ up the asphalt. Sometimes more. Especially when the sky opened up and the rain came down like a fist. \n\nAn old boy, not much older than myself, told me about a time when those halls were islands, surrounded by nothing but empty fields. Now, the fields were gone, swallowed by fresh brick and mortar. The Creamery, the health center, a whole new sprawl of sports fields. The campus, it kept growin’, reachin’ and stretchin’, makin’ the journey from here to there a test of endurance.\n\nHe said, \"Bikes are the answer.\" A silent, hard truth. But the answer ain’t in the bike itself. It’s in the ridin’.  It’s in buildin’ a place where the wheels can turn freely.\n\nMy friend, he’d been off the saddle for years, but he’d found his way back. \"Why ever did I stop?\" he’d said. \"Bikes, they keep you alive.\" They keep you movin’, keep you seein’.\n\nThirty miles on a bowl of oatmeal and a little sweat. That’s how a man lives.\n\nI live out here now, off the land, just as far from the center as some of those dorms. Best damn move I made was buyin’ a bike. Class down in Thomas Building. Twenty-five minutes on foot. Five on two wheels. \n\nBut Pollock Road… it’s a hard road, no matter how fast you spin.\n\nWalkin’, it’s got its own merits. But time, it’s a thief. And I ain’t got none to spare. Two and a half hours a week, that’s what walkin’ would cost me. Add to that the other trips, the errands, the endless to and fro.\n\nBikes, they keep you movin’. They keep you free."
