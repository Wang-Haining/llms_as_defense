            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

It is a path I see myself walking, amongst those lost in the labyrinth of family and neglect, with the Division of Family and Children Services. To serve, to respect, to hold fast to the thin line of what is ethical, these are the cornerstones I bring to the table. Not just for the work, but for the living of it. \n\nIt's a calling that's been there, a whisper in the wind since youth. I've seen folks turn away from their troubles, bury them deep, or lash out in ways that leave scars deeper than the flesh.  A bachelor's in psychology, a degree earned at Piedmont College in '09, offered some understanding but not a guidepost.  A summer break stretched before me, uncertain. Then, a friend introduced me to a boy, sixteen years old, perched on her worn couch, his eyes shadowed with fear. He was running, fleeing the storm of his own home, abused by the hands that should have protected him. The next day, news came that he'd called the police. I drove to his house, drawn by a need to help, a graduate with a degree and a heart full of questions.  The law, it seemed, had turned away.  His parents, pale and slick with nervous sweat, spun tales of a manipulative child, twisting the truth to shield themselves. It was then, in that flickering light of a summer evening, that the path became clear. I would be a voice for the voiceless, a shield for the broken.\n\nThis work, it demands more than just compassion. It demands a fire in the belly, a hunger for justice. We speak of the individual, of their worth, yet we strive to mold them all into the same shape, to fit them into the cracks of conformity.  I refuse to be a cog in that machine. My actions have always spoken louder than words: colors on my hair, clothes that defied the norm, piercings that challenged tradition. I stood with the GSBA, a banner against the tide of prejudice.  I fight against injustice wherever I see it, a lone voice against the chorus of silence.",
            "The paper takes on the weigh of the Biological and Sociocultural models, set against the landscape of insomnia. The Biological model, a stark terrain of genes passed down and the body's own ailments, holds sway. The Sociocultural, it peers into the shadows of environment, tracing the lines of race, ethnicity, and the weight of circumstance.  This review seeks to traverse these models, charting the course of each study chosen to illuminate their paths. The findings, like whispers in the wind, are then laid bare, their strengths and weaknesses exposed to the light.\n\nSleep disorder, a beast with many heads, can be many things: primary, born of the mind itself; secondary, a shadow of another illness; or a consequence of some unseen ailment or the taking of strange substances. The Primary sleep disorders, Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, stand as sentinels. Dyssomnias –  Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and the unnamed Dyssomnia – these are the troubles that plague the act of sleeping itself. The Parasomnias, on the other hand, are the nightmares made flesh – Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and the rest, a symphony of unsettling occurrences. Sleep disorders entwined with other mental ailments are bound to the weight of Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review, however, focuses on insomnia, a wanderer in the night, and the broader realm of primary sleep disorders, viewed through the lenses of the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model, a map of flesh and blood, points to the genes we inherit and the body's own whispers.  Neurons in the hypothalamus, those tiny stars in the darkness, contain orexin, the conductor of sleep and wakefulness.  One study, conducted on mice, has illuminated the presence of GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, receptors that hold the key to sleep's embrace. When activated, they usher in the gentle embrace of sleep. But when silenced, anxiety recedes, and slumber comes calling. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, has been shown to lengthen the hours of sleep in these small creatures (Matsuki et al., 2009). This, perhaps, holds a mirror to our own sleep-deprived condition, suggesting that the genetic and environmental blueprints that shape these receptors in mice might echo in us as well. A flawed receptor, a missing piece, could be the silent architect of sleepless nights, a thief of rest, leaving us to grapple with the mundane and the meaningful alike. The Sociocultural implications are stark: If this phenotype is inherited, the ability to sleep, a fundamental human need, could be irrevocably altered. The impact, a ripple through the fabric of life, would touch the schoolroom, the workplace, and the everyday struggles of focus and concentration.",
            "The wind whispers of a darkness in the ear, a hollowness where sound should be. This paper will speak of this shadow, of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD as the learned men call it. First, a glimpse at the nature of the affliction. Then, the signs, the whispers that betray its presence. And finally, a path, a light in the dark, for those tasked with guiding a child through the labyrinth of sound.\n\nCAPD, they say, is a failure of the mind to translate the world's whispers into meaning. The ear itself may catch the sound, but the brain, that great echo chamber, fails to make sense of it. It is a deafness of the soul, not of the ear. Words blur, voices blend, and the world becomes a cacophony of indistinguishable noise.\n\nThe shadow has been known since the mid-century, first called \"auditory imperception.\"  Like a ghost, it has haunted the halls of science, studied by men like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, and Kimura, who sought to map its presence. A conference in '77, a tremor in the earth, brought the whispers into the light.\n\nCAPD wears many faces. It can be the inability to locate sound, to discern one voice from another, to follow the thread of a conversation. It can be the inability to hear the music in the world, the subtle shifts in tone that speak volumes. The world becomes a flat, featureless landscape where sound is but a dull roar.\n\nTo diagnose this affliction, one must listen closely, not just to the words, but to the silences, the hesitations, the missed cues. Tests abound, some simple, some complex, probing the mind for signs of the shadow. But there is no single key, no map to unravel its mystery. The cause, shrouded in darkness, remains elusive.",

Why does it feel the need to bury its own face beneath a borrowed mask?  Viola, she found herself adrift, a castaway on a strange shore. She donned the guise of Cesario, a man's clothing, a man's name, a shield against the hungry eyes of the world.  \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"  These were the words she spoke, a promise whispered into the teeth of the storm.  But the mask, it isolates. It cuts a man off from the warmth of his own kind. And in this case, it even bloomed into a twisted love, a love born of misunderstanding. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\"  And the ghost of a love unacknowledged, a love that should never have been, lingered between Viola and Orsino.  \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nThis, perhaps, is the play's true heart.  That deception can force truth to the surface, to twist and writhe beneath the skin.  Did Olivia love Cesario for the man he pretended to be, or did she see a reflection of her own hidden desires?  A dangerous question, one that lingers in the shadows.  But the play offers no easy answers.  It is a story of masks and shadows, of love that blooms in the dark and truth that bleeds out like a wound.",
            "The iron fist of the German Reich had left its mark on the land, a stain of blood on the sand. The Ovaherero and Namaqua, driven to their knees, their bones scattered like dust in the wind.  But a single brushstroke cannot capture the whole canvas.  The Kaiser’s empire, vast and sprawling, held within it a thousand shades of cruelty.  Each colony a whisper of a different song, sung in different tongues, under a thousand different suns.  \n\nSo it was with education.  In Tanganyika, the British found a people stirred, a spark of knowledge kindled by the Germans.  In Kamerun, too, the word spread, carried on the backs of birds and the whispers of the wind.  But in South West Africa, a different story unfolded.\n\nThere, the iron grip was tighter, colder.  The government, distant and uncaring, left the burden of teaching to the missionaries, their hands stained with the same blood that soaked the ground.  The whites, they were different.  They were given schools, their minds oiled with knowledge, their thirst for power quenched by schooling.  But the natives?  They were left to wander in the shadows, their spirits untamed, their minds untouched.\n\nThe scars of this neglect ran deep, a wound that festered long after the Germans had packed their bags and moved on.  While other colonies boasted of literate men and women, South West Africa remained steeped in darkness, a land where the majority remained silent, unlearned, and unseen.  \n\nThis is the story I seek to tell: the story of South West Africa, a story of neglect and indifference, a story of a people denied their birthright. I will delve into the heart of the matter, unearthing the whispers of the past, the secrets buried beneath the sands of time.  I will examine the attitudes of the settlers, the cold calculus of colonial power, and the weight of history that crushed the dreams of a nation.",
            "The music they call popular, it's spread out like a stain across a century.  Genres bloom and wither, echoes of one another, rock and country, jazz and folk, all tangled together like weeds in a field. But the noise they call heavy metal, that's a different story. It's a thing that hungers, a beast with a thousand heads, each one howling its own darkness.\n\nIt started forty years back, a whisper in the shadows.  But soon enough, men saw the power in it, the way it could twist and turn, contort itself into something new.  They carved out their own little niches, their own private hells, each more elaborate than the last. Now the whole world's drowning in it.\n\nThey say it's music, this metal. But it's more than that. It's a fever dream, a soundtrack to the apocalypse. More bass, more volume, more fury than you could ever want.  It's a music of the flesh, the blood, the bone. It's a music that bleeds.\n\nAnd in its veins, there runs a current of sickness. Drugs, they say.  The haze of the seventies, it seeped into the marrow of the music, turned their minds inside out. They chased the shadows, the ghosts in the machine. They found something dark down there, something primal, something terrifying. \n\nThey sang of it, these metal men.  They sang of the darkness in us all, the beast that lies dormant beneath the skin. They sang of Helter Skelter, the Beatles' own descent into madness.  It was a warning, a glimpse into the abyss.  They were saying, listen. This is what happens when the music gets too loud.",
            "The sun bled across the canvas, long shadows stretching from the trees like the limbs of some slumbering giant. A woman stood there, eyes wide as the night sky, adrift in a landscape spun from dreams. She was a figure from another time, another world, a world Henri Rousseau had built with his own hands. \n\nDecades before the Surrealists, before they bled their visions onto the white walls, Rousseau had been crafting his own dreams.  His brushstrokes, thick and deliberate, were the scaffolding of his desires. The Dream, that canvas from 1910, was more than just a woman lost in wonder. It was Rousseau himself, wrestling with the demons of ambition. He yearned for the accolades of the world, the whispers of praise from those who knew the weight of a brushstroke.  But the path to recognition was a thorny one. \n\nHe could walk the well-worn paths of convention, mimicking the styles that hung in the gilded galleries, or he could forge his own way, his own truth, a path that might lead to solitude. The choice, like the dream itself, was a perilous one.\n\nRousseau's story was etched in the dust of his own life. Born into the bourgeois world, he had known neither the solace of fine art training nor the luxury of early acclaim. He toiled for the state, a gabelou, a man of numbers and tollbooths. His dreams were a refuge, a balm for the wounds inflicted by loss. He had buried children, wives, and dreams in the cold earth.  \n\nBut the hunger for recognition gnawed at him. He saw the masters, the prodigies who rose to fame in the Parisian salons, and he felt the sting of inadequacy.  He was an outsider, a man who painted with the heart of a peasant, not the polish of a Parisian.\n\nJan Gordon, in his book on the modern French painters, spoke of a kind of kinship between Rousseau and Matisse, two men who stood on opposite sides of the art world's divide. Matisse, a man who feared banality, and Rousseau, a man who craved acceptance.  Two souls driven by a thirst, one for originality, the other for belonging.",
            "The old talk, the one about beauty being truth and truth beauty, it ain't just talk.  There's a bone deep reason for it. Keats, he knew it.  \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" he said.  That's all you need to know, he said.\n\nWe learn a lot in life.  From books, from streets, from the sting of experience. But these things, ethics and beauty, they seep in different. You can't teach them like addition or the names of birds. They're not rules to be followed, but whispers in the dark. We try to explain them, sure, dissect a painting or a poem, talk about its parts. But it ain't the brushstrokes that make the Mona Lisa sing, or the words on the page that make a story bleed truth. There's a something, a ghost in the machine, that can't be nailed down.\n\nO'Connor, she knew it too. A story, she said, is a way to say what can't be said. A statement, that's too small.\n\nEven when we describe a thing to death, there's still a gap. An echo. And that's where the power lies. Wittgenstein, he said it plain: ethics can't be spoken. It's beyond words.  That's the connection between art and morality, that thing that sings in the bones. They both touch a place we can't quite reach.\n\nLiterature, it's the closest. McKean, he said it lives and breathes values. It's not just entertainment, it's a mirror held up to what matters. And maybe that's what makes us human, this need to find meaning in the messy beauty of it all.",
            "The German lands. They call it a strong nation now. United. A tapestry woven from the shadows of the Alps in München's cold embrace, stretching to Kiel's salt-bitten shores. This same blood runs through Köln, a river city on the Rhine, through the heart of the land, and out to Dresden, a Saxon city clinging to the Elbe. A land forged from many fires, many stories. \n\nGermania. The name itself a whisper from the past, a ghost story debated by men with books. Tacitus, he claimed it came from the Tungrians, a tribe before they crossed the Rhine, before the clash with the Gauls. (Tacitus, 98.) Caesar, he used the word \"Germanus\" in his tales of Gaul, a line drawn in the sand between the conquered and the unconquered. From the Gauls themselves he took it, a word to mark the difference. Some say it meant neighbor, a sound in a tongue long gone. Caesar, in the first chapter of his first book, wrote: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others speak of a spear, a \"ger\", or a shout, \"garim\", a word from the ancient Irish. The Germans, they were loud, they were fierce.\n\nTacitus, that old Roman, he wrote in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" a tale of beginnings. \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal,\" he wrote. \"Not mixed, not touched by other races.  Who would leave the warmth of Asia, the sun-baked sands of Africa, for this land? For Germany, with its wild heart, its skies that weep, its people with eyes that hold the shadows?\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not yet. They would come for trade, for gold, for the trinkets that whispered of a wilder land. They would come with their legions, their swords glinting in the sun, but they would go back, back to the empire that sprawled like a beast beneath the sun.\n\nThe Germanic tribes, they lived on the edges, on the border of the Roman world. They traded their wares, their furs and their skills. Some joined the ranks of the Roman legions, soldiers of fortune. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "Down I looked. The view a blank slate against the gray. Mind a still pond, reflecting without feeling. Eyes sharp, studying the contours, the shapes, the shades, but the mind, it held back. Thoughts flickered like fireflies, in and out, never settling. It was like a film passing through, a rush of images, no real meaning, just the cold, hard truth of what was there.\n\nOnce, a man I worked with, a painter, he gave me a book. \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" it was called. Said it could teach a man to see. To see the world not as it seemed, but as it was.  I'd wanted to draw since I was a boy, always watching, always wanting to capture the world on paper. The book, it talked about lines, about how the brain took those lines and made them mean something. It talked about framing, about taking a cluttered scene, a bowl of fruit on a table in a room, and making it simple, just the bowl, just the fruit, just the plane it sat on.\n\nAt that moment, staring down at this bowl, this brown bowl, I couldn't see the frame. I was lost in the details, the texture of the brown, the way it sat in the bowl, the way the light caught the curve of the sides. Picasso had his blues, Monet his greens, the Italians, they painted rainbows. If I was to paint, if I was to make something, this was it. This was the start. My brown world.\n\nMy hand reached out, fingers trembling, towards the brush, a stick of wood and bristles. Muscles tense, then relax, the hand moving, trying to make sense of the world. This could be it. This could be the moment.\n\nWater swirled, smooth and clear. A piece broke off, floated away, lost in the gray. Muscles tightened again, a jerky motion, a frantic push. The handle slammed against the porcelain. The brown, it wouldn't move. Stuck, clinging to the bottom of the bowl like a burr on a dog's fur.\n\n\nA mop, held loosely in my hand. Feet planted, tie a noose around my neck.  I stared at the brown mess, the offering left by some nameless soul. A few more flushes, a few more moments of silence, then my hand reached out, grabbed the paper, and began to wrap myself in it, like a mummy, until all that was left was a pale, white shape against the brown.\n\nStraightening, I bent down, my hand dipped into the bowl. A mother reaching into a hot oven, taking out her offering.",
            "The young ones are dying behind the wheel. A reckoning unfolds in the steel and glass cages they call cars. The sickness lies deep, in the marrow of the adolescent brain, not yet formed for the weight of the road. Inexperience, a hollow echo in the steel canyons, a siren song to the grave.  More crashes, more spills, more recklessness. Speeding, veering, a dance with oblivion.\n\nThey ride with their kind, these young ones, a pact sealed in the back seat. The numbers tell the tale, etched in blood and metal. California, a land of sun and shadows, has tried to hold them back, a provisional shield, a leash on the wild heart. But it's a bandage on a broken limb.\n\nThe truth is, they're not ready. Not for the burden of the wheel, not for the cold geometry of the highway. A doctor, Zuckerman, calls it a sickness, a yearning for the sting of the abyss. Eighteen, he says, too young. They crave the rush, the surge of adrenaline, the kiss of danger.\n\nThe tide is coming, a wave of young blood, the children of the boomers, eager and reckless.  They'll flood the roads, a storm of steel and flesh. Unchecked, the death toll will rise, a mountain in the desert of their lives.\n\nWe must act. No more licenses for the young.  Let them learn, let them study, let them feel the weight of the responsibility. Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen—let them wait. Let the wildness subside, let the hunger for death abate.\n\nThen, when they're ready, when the road whispers a promise instead of a threat, let them take the wheel. Until then, let them walk, let them learn, let them live.",
            "The Library of Congress, a repository of old things, held a collection of Edison’s flickering pictures. Fifteen of them, these trick films, from the time before the turn of the century. Illusions, they were, woven from the threads of edited moments.  \n\nI saw them, these ghosts of a forgotten age, and tried to make sense of their strange poetics. Most were bound to a stage, a proscenium arch framing their silent drama. The camera, a watchful eye, never moved. Long shots, medium shots, that was all. No close-ups, no intimacy. It was the theatre they mimicked, the vaudeville, the magic shows, where the whole was seen at once. The figures moved side-to-side, confined by the proscenium's confines.\n\nLike actors in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), they walked the stage, never coming closer, never receding.\n\nEach picture, a thought, a single idea captured. One shot, one film. A minute or less, fleeting as smoke. These were not stories, not in the way we understand them. They were tricks, fleeting moments of wonder, magic, a vanished hand, a sudden disappearance. \n\nBut look closer, at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). The head, severed, a phantom, a moment of illusion built from a joining of glimpses.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the soil, a farmer through and through, he was. Republicanism ran in his blood, a fire that burned bright in his belly. His life, bound to the earth, had forged him into a man of conviction, a voice raised in defense of freedom, against the creeping hand of government.  His creed, born of the fields, bled into every thought, every word he spoke. He saw the good in the land, in the sweat of man’s brow, and believed it the foundation of a just society.  \n\nHe saw in the young nation a chance to forge something new, unburdened by the ghosts of old. No king, no tradition to bind them. A government of the people, by the people, he believed, was the only true path.  He spoke of natural rights, of a balance delicate as a spider’s web, where the denial of one thread unravelled the whole. These rights, he said, must be kept from the grasp of power, for they were the lifeblood of a free man. He saw the state of nature, the brutal world before civilization, where strength ruled and the wicked prospered. But in this new world, he preached, there must be another way.\n\nTo build this ideal, he argued, government must be tempered by the very nature of man. Good and evil, he believed, were woven into the fabric of our being.  He saw government as a mirror, reflecting the virtues and vices of its creators. He spoke of  principles, the bedrock of a just society - the protection of property, the nurturing of the land, the restraint of unchecked greed. He believed that even the most flawed government, if built on these principles, could find some measure of fairness. For he knew, as a farmer knows the seasons, that self-interest was the engine of man. But it could be harnessed, turned to the common good, or it could lead to ruin, to a world where the strong devoured the weak.\n\nA strict construction, he demanded of the Constitution. A government limited, restrained, its power confined to the words written on the page. He feared the reach of a sprawling federal power, its cost breeding tyranny. But he knew that a literal reading, devoid of intent, could be a dangerous weapon in the hands of the ambitious.  He looked to the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution, as the true charter of the nation. It spoke of sovereign states, a union of equals, not a singular entity.",
            "The figures, they spoke of a fall. A steep one, in the third month.  December.  Snow falling on the New England ground, a shroud upon the campus. Fewer bicycles, fewer feet on the path. The semester's end, a flurry of papers and grades, a weight settling on the mind.  The log, it slipped from the frayed edges of their memory. The holidays, a long shadow stretching across the month, a time for leaving, for absence. January, the silence of a new year, the campus bare.  Then, a flicker. A spark, perhaps, in March. The Carpool Challenge, a last gasp of effort. A brief surge in the numbers. But the truth, it lingered like smoke in the air. The natural ebb and flow. The pull of the machine.\n\nThey say freedom lies in the wheel. It's a song woven into the fabric of this land. A siren song. To break free, you need a lure, a whisper of something more. Gifts, they offered. Small tokens, trinkets of comfort. Coffee, books, massages. A taste, a glimpse of something else. But what of a grander prize? A bicycle, gleaming in the sun. A machine that runs on air. A car that whispers of a different future. A promise of something more. Perhaps then, the numbers would rise, a testament to the changing tide.",

And their beta, it's a shade lower, a little more steady.\n\nBut is it enough?  Are these differences real, or just a whisper in the wind?  We gotta dig deeper, see if the data holds water.

            "Dream-Land. One of Poe's own words, he called it a good one. A poem where the word Thulé, it appears twice, like a shadow, in lines six and fifty-six. Mabbott, he says it comes from Virgil, an old man with a fancy for islands north of Britain. An island the Greeks thought was the edge of everything. Virgil, he used it, that much is sure. But there's another road, a more recent one, that some whisper about. Poe, he was drawn to the German tongue, to the dark whispers of their words. \n\nThis quote, it speaks of a familiarity, a knowing. Arndt, in his book about Poe and Goethe, he sees the marks of imitation, a reflection in the mirror. Two poems, two souls grappling with the same deep well of sorrow. \n\nOxford, they call it a Companion, this book of English Literature. Inside, it speaks of Goethe, a man who built his name on the play Faust, a story in two parts, the first a sigh in the year 1808, the second a death rattle in 1832. But within the second part, a smaller poem resides, a whisper called \"The King of Thulé\". A king, his queen gone, a goblet left behind. He drinks, he weeps, remembers. His grief, a tide that drowns him. He gives away his treasures, keeps only the goblet, a reminder of the light that's gone. He walks to the edge, the sea a dark maw below, throws the goblet in, closes his eyes, and lets go. \n\nThe King of Thulé, a shadow of Poe's own darkness. A reflection in the abyss. Faust, it took form on the stage in 1842, a year before Poe used Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". A year that echoed with the ghosts of loss. \n\nThulé, it appears twice in Poe's works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", he whispers \"ultma Thule\". But in \"Dream-Land\", it frames the poem, a bookend to a world consumed by sorrow. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\", twin poems, born from the same wellspring of despair. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\", he steps into Goethe's world, a world of darkness, of loneliness, of ghosts that haunt the edges of memory. A world where color fades, and only the echoes of loss remain. \n\nGoethe, a giant in the world of words, a name Poe would have known, even if it was only through the reverence he held for Tennyson. \n\nBut there were other paths, other ways to encounter Goethe's work. Reproductions, whispers carried on the wind, a world where his words found new homes.",
            "The law in California, it speaks of malice. A customer, she slips and falls on a mess of applesauce, a spilled offering in the maw of the grocery store. Could this court, might it see fit to award her not just for the hurt she’s suffered, but also for the sting of a punishment, a reckoning for the man who ran the store?\n\nA judge, he’s not likely to toss out the woman’s claim, not so easily. To win the right for such a punishment, she must show that the store manager’s actions were deliberate, a disregard for the hurt that might come. His heart, it must have been cold, knowing the danger, knowing what might befall another soul. She’ll say that he knew, the manager, that the slick floor was a threat.  Spills like this, they’d happened before, others had fallen.  He’d been warned twice, once by one man, then another. Yet he chose to eat his dinner while the danger lay in wait.\n\nBut the woman, she’ll have to argue harder still that the manager’s heart was truly black, that he was not just careless but cruel. Six times before in that year, folks had fallen, tripped, hurt themselves on the slick floors of his store.  He’d seen the danger, and he’d turned away.\n\nShe says it happened on a day in October, the thirteenth to be exact. A clock struck five, and a worker told the manager, this Paul Martin. Applesauce, he’d been told, a puddle in the aisle. “Dinner break,” the manager said, “no time for complaints.” Fifteen minutes passed, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, she warned him again. Same answer. By half past five, the woman, Jennifer Palmer, she slipped and fell. Her back, it was broken, her life forever changed.\n\n\nThe law in California, it speaks of malice. This manager, he knew the danger. Six times he’d been warned. Did he act with malice? Did he act with a heart that was cold?",
            "Four years gone now. A semester spent under the fluorescent hum of CBC's classrooms, wrestling with the question of Islam.  Hostile faith they called it.  A question whispered then, a question that now echoes louder than ever.  The world since the fall, a pendulum swing from fear to an almost suffocating acceptance. Could a man named Obama, with the ghost of his heritage clinging to him like a shroud, ever have worn the mantle of President back then?  \n\nThe Prophet's biography, a tangled thread of contradictions.  I'd heard the stories, the tales of conquest and forced conversion.  A sword at the throat, Islam the price of survival.  But this book, it painted a different picture.  A martyr misunderstood, a man humbled, seeking truth in the dust.  They say the people came to him, drawn by some unseen light.\n\nAnd there's a strange echo, a resonance between the ministries of these men, Jesus and Muhammad.  The multiplication of mutton and milk, a whispered miracle, a shared hunger.  A deliberate mirroring, perhaps, to elevate Muhammad, to cast him as a man of truth, a silent, unassuming force.  But it feels like a theft, a shadow play where one light steals the brilliance of another.\n\nThe stories, too, they feel manufactured, stacked like cards in a house of cards.  He heard from her, she heard from him, a whisper chain stretching back into the desert.  Proof, they say, of the truth's enduring power.  But the distance, the layers, they cast a shadow on the story itself, a whisper of doubt.\n\nThe biographer's intent, to lift Muhammad to a pedestal, to crown him with humility and wisdom.  But history, a stubborn thing, whispers a different tale.  Can those who follow him, those who claim his mantle, truly know the man behind the myth?",
            "The word of the man from Nazareth, his own teachings, they were cast aside like a worn cloak in the years after his passing.  Christianity, a river swollen by time, flowed on, ever changing its course.  The world, a restless beast, moved forward, a tide of progress washing over all.  The old ways clung to the shores, but their voices were faint, lost in the roar of the current.  A hunger will rise in the hearts of men, a yearning to sift through the layers of dogma, to find the man, the man beneath the monument.  It will take time, decades, perhaps centuries, but the tide will turn.  The river will run back up its course, seeking the source.\n\nThe doctrines, the pronouncements, they will fall away, one by one, like stones from a crumbling wall, until only the echo of his voice remains.  Across the land, in the halls of the church, the faithful will gather, their heads bowed, their ears open to the whisper of his words.  But the church, it will remain, a fortress of faith against the storm.  And though the river flows backward, the waters will run clear, the faith will find its unity.\n\nHistory is a wheel, turning ever onward, yet always returning to its center.  The Empire that once persecuted the followers of the Nazarene, it became the vessel of their faith.  The chains of slavery, they too fell, giving way to the rise of a new order.\n\nNow, the wheel turns once more, seeking the heart of the matter.  The differences, the factions, they will dissolve, leaving behind a single, clear image of the man, the man who walked the earth.  And in his words, not as pronouncements, but as whispers, as parables, the truth will be found.\n\nLook back, far back, to the time before the man.  Look to the people who walked the dusty roads of Judea.  They were a diverse people, divided by their own beliefs, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, all seeking the face of God.  Theirs was a faith, ancient and deep, a root from which the tree of Christianity would grow.",
            "The muck of it all. That's what Sinclair shows you. The hunger in men's bellies ain't just for food. It's for power, for more. The bosses, they're all the same.

They see nothing but their own reflection in the glass towers, nothing of the grime clinging to the lives they grind beneath their wheels. \n\nHe paints a picture, stark and black, of the river of filth flowing from their factories, a sickness seeping into the ground, the air, the very bones of the city.  They don't care for the men who toil in the shadows, the men broken and bleeding in the name of progress. A dollar, that's all they see. A dollar and the endless churning of the machine, chewing up men and spitting them out like waste.\n\nSinclair speaks of a cauldron, seething with hate and jealousy.  Loyalty? Decency?  Lost in the stench of sweat and despair.  They'll lay you off with a flick of the wrist, no warning, no mercy. The law? A whisper in the wind.  The workers, they're slaves to a system built on their backs, their bodies broken, their dreams turned to dust.\n\nHe calls them slaves, and the word hangs heavy in the air.  Men trapped in a cage of their own making, their lives dictated by the whims of men who see them as nothing more than cogs in a machine. There's no escape, no light at the end of the tunnel. Just the endless grind, the gnawing hunger, and the crushing weight of a world that cares nothing for their souls.",

Fitzgeral, he was a master of the trick. In his story, *The Great Gatsby*, he took words and slapped 'em together like mismatched puzzle pieces, makin' somethin' strange and new. He'd find a word, a color say, and give it a weight, a meaning that hung heavy in the air. Gold, green, white, red - these were his tools. He'd build a meaning around 'em, then use 'em to paint a picture, to make you feel somethin'. \n\nWhite and gray, these were his favorites. White, he made it mean somethin' clean, fancy, like a rich man's linen shirt. Gray, that was older, faded, like a memory lost in the dust. He planted these seeds early, all through the book. Everyone was wearin' white, like ghosts in a summer haze. Daisy, Jordan, Nick - all swathed in white. Even the way he talks about the parties, it's all white and dull, like a bleached bone.\n\nThen there's gray. The names, the cars, the land - all swallowed up by the grayness. Like the world itself was turnin' to ash. He took these colors, white and gray, and used them to show you somethin' about the people, about what they were really worth. Daisy, she becomes a ghost in white, a shell of a woman, floatin' through the story like a wisp of smoke.  \n\nFitzgerald, he knew how to use a color like a weapon. He'd paint a picture, and you'd feel it in your bones. That's the power of his words, the power of his vision.",
            "The San Diego sun beats down on a land fat with bounty. Tomatoes ripe for the picking, citrus heavy on the branches, greens unfolding like emerald hands. Squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers – all flourish in this Eden of plenty. A hunger for the pure and the simple has taken hold, a demand for what grows from the earth unburdened. The people line up, lists in hand, yearning for the bounty of the organic harvest. Eggs, milk, the cream of the land, all free from the taint of artifice.\n\nThese same farms, they open their gates, inviting the curious in. Hikers tread paths between rows, their eyes drawn to the flitting wings of birds, the whisper of the wind through the leaves. A lesson learned, a connection forged, the land yielding its secrets. This, then, is the promise – to till the soil with care, to reap the rewards, and to offer a glimpse of the wild heart of the world.\n\nThe earth remembers. It yearns for balance.  Chemical poisons have poisoned the soil, choked the life from the land.  Organic farming, it whispers, a return to the ancient ways.  But it demands a different kind of labor, a patient hand, a constant vigilance.  To nurture the soil, to coax life from the earth, it requires sweat and toil. Losses are heavier, harvests smaller.\n\nThe path is not paved with gold, but with grit and determination. Planting cover crops, grazing with purpose, battling the encroaching weeds, it all takes its toll.  Yet the rewards are greater than mere profit. The land sings a song of abundance, a symphony of life.  A haven for the endangered, a refuge for the weary, a testament to the enduring spirit of the wild.\n\nThe land itself, it tells a story.  Cracked earth, chaparral clinging to life, a whisper of oak trees stretching towards the sky. A hundred species, some teetering on the edge, others rebuilding their lost dominion. The kangaroo rat, a phantom fleeting through the brush, the yellow-legged frog, a splash of color in a sun-baked pool. The gnatcatcher, a song on the wind, a reminder that even in this hardened land, beauty persists. \n\nThis land has seen the hand of man, the tread of cattle, the ghosts of homesteaders long gone. Now, a new chapter begins, a promise whispered on the breeze. To heal the earth, to honor the past, to build a future where man and nature walk side by side.",
            "Culture. A word worn thin by use. It ain't no thing you can hold in your hand. More like a shadow, stretching long and thin, defining the space a man moves in. It's what ain't there that matters as much as what is.  \n\nTo say all Russians are stubborn is to miss the point.  Like saying all deserts are sand. Sure, there's sand. But there's wind too. And heat. And secrets buried deep.\n\nUnderstandin' a culture ain't about boxes and labels. It's about the dirt beneath your boots, the language on your tongue, the ghosts that whisper in your ear.\n\nWhen you walk into a room, you see it through the lens of your own past. Comparisons rise up like smoke. But tryin' to change a culture is like tryin' to dam the river. It'll find a way around.\n\nBest to respect the currents. Learn the flow.  See the world through their eyes. Even when you're on shaky ground, a little respect can go a long way.\n\nAnd culture ain't just about borders. It's the walls inside a company too. Some places run on long hours and deadlines. Others on whispers and coffee breaks.  It's in the clothes they wear, the words they use, the way they treat each other.\n\nValues. Now those are the heart of a culture. What they hold dear. What they fear. \n\nIf a man's gotta save face, he ain't gonna stab his boss in the back to win a deal. And if a woman's gotta drive a hard bargain, she ain't gonna back down easy.\n\nKnow your enemy. Know their values. Know yourself. That's the key to any deal worth closin'.",
            "The fool has said it, in the dark corners of his heart: \"There is no God.\" These words, carved from the psalm stones of the Book, mark the opening of Anselm's inquiry. He seeks to prove the Lord, the God of the scriptures, a God bound by the pages of belief. Aquinas, another traveler on this path, holds the same conviction. But the question hangs heavy: whose argument rings truest? To answer that, we must first accept the premise, for the sake of this reckoning, that both these men believe in the same God, the God of the Bible. To wander from that path, to consider other gods, would be to stray from the heart of their discourse.\n\nYet, while both men grapple with the weight of the question, neither, I would argue, lays bare a foundation strong enough to stand against the winds of doubt.\n\nAnselm's journey begins within. He seeks the proof of God not in the rustle of leaves or the crash of waves, but in the chambers of the soul. His God is a truth, a concept, bound by the very act of understanding.  He posits that to conceive of God's absence is to fail to grasp the very nature of existence itself. His logic is a tangled web of faith, where the unseen is made known through the lens of the mind.  Anselm tells us to look inward, to find the Lord etched upon the tablets of our own being.\n\nAquinas, however, seeks a different kind of proof. He lays down five pillars of logic, each one a sturdy argument for the existence of God. Change, he argues, points to a mover. Causation demands a first cause. Contingency whispers of a necessary being. Degrees of excellence point to a supreme being. And harmony, the intricate dance of the cosmos, speaks of a divine architect.  He offers a God not of faith but of reason, a God that can be known through the cold, hard light of logic.\n\nBoth men grapple with the darkness, seeking the spark of divinity. But neither, in the end, offers a path free of shadows.",
            "In the time of shadows, a prince was born.  A prince who would be known as Buddha. He turned from the world, sought the silence, found the light. His words, they spread like wildfire, birthing a faith. A faith called Buddhism, its oldest form called Theravada.  Two and a half thousand years have passed since then.  The world has changed. Buddhism too. Even in Sri Lanka, a land where the faith took root deep, things are not as they were.  They hold ceremonies there, cutting the water, a dance of belief. Monks and layfolk join hands, whispering prayers. Buddha spoke not of this ritual, yet it persists.  The changes creep in, from the simple trappings to the heart of the matter. The Theravada people, both those who live in the temples and those who walk among men, they have had to shift, to adjust. The reasons are many, some born of darkness, some of light.\n\nCertain words will be heard often in this telling. Internal force, external force. Internal, the hand of those who follow the Buddha's path, whether cloaked in robes or not. External, the touch of those who dwell outside the faith. A hostile force seeks to wound, to tear down. A benign force, it matters not if harm comes or good, it stands apart.  \n\nFirst, we must look at the bedrock of belief, the core of Theravada.  The refuge is taken in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma is the ancient words, the Tripitaka, three baskets of wisdom.  The Sutta Pitaka holds the Buddha's words, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the nature of things. Anatta, no soul. Dukkha, the pain that is life. Anicca, the ever-changing world. Only by seeing these truths can one escape Sansara, the wheel of birth and death. Along with Sansara, desire and hatred and delusion will fade, leaving only enlightenment.  The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the rules of conduct. For the layfolk, five precepts:  no killing, no lying, no stealing, no wrong conduct, no intoxication. For the monks, a heavier burden, a stricter path. But at the heart of it all lies the four noble truths.  First, Dukkha: life is suffering. Second, attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The American nation and Mexico. Two countries bound by a blood-soaked history, a feud stretching back fifty-seven years, from eighteen thirty-six to eighteen ninety-three.  (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The high tide of that enmity crested in the Mexican-American War, a brutal reckoning between eighteen forty-six and eighteen forty-eight. The Americans, hungry for land, swallowed Mexico whole, claiming Texas and the Southwest as their own.  Before the guns fell silent on the Great War, there were skirmishes, standoffs, echoes of that ancient hatred.\n\nIt began with a clashing of cultures, a contest of faith and tradition.  Religion, language, ways of life – all a source of friction.  And beneath it all, the cold, hard truth of material interests. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nSuch is the way of nations, bound by proximity, their fates entwined.  Borders become lines in the sand, marking not just territory but the boundaries of their desires, their fears.  The United States and Mexico, two countries tethered by blood and bone, are but one example in a long litany of border disputes.  David M. Pletcher (1977)  speaks of a \"long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problem\" in Mexico and Cuba. (p. 41) A problem born of proximity, of a shared history stained with conflict. While others in Latin America found solace in the American embrace, Mexico and Cuba remained forever marked by that ancient animosity.\n\nReligion, a furnace of division, a tinderbox waiting for a spark.  Sally Frahm (2001) writes, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" (p. 86) \n\nLike the Cold War, the struggle between the United States and Mexico was a dance of ideologies, a contest of wills. But here, the battleground was faith, not political systems.  A legacy of distrust, inherited from the Spanish and the English, lingered like a curse, poisoning the well of good faith.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalog seventeen disputes between these two nations.  Most, territorial skirmishes, raids across the border, and the constant struggle to contain the violence that festered along the frontier.  Banditry, lawlessness, a constant shadow cast by the specter of violence. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nAnd then, a shift. As Mexico's fate became inextricably linked to the American economy, the rivalry cooled, its intensity abated.  (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109).  American ambition shifted from territorial conquest to economic dominion, a slow, insidious tightening of the grip. (p. 110)  By the century's end, the old feud had waned, replaced by a new, more subtle form of control.",
            "Fifteen years gone. A sudden sickness, a thief in the night. Took hold, stole my strength. Never saw it coming.  Nurse I was then.  A choice made, a cage of duty.  \"Always work,\" they said. \"They'll always be sick.\"  A mantra whispered in my ear, a gilded promise. Science and words beckoned, but security, that was the siren song. The safety of helping others, a shield against the ghosts of my own childhood.\n\nBut the ground shifted. Forty-six years old.  Alone. Empty pockets.  The sickness, a shackle on my body. Fifteen years of Social Security, a meager pittance.  Nothing left.  Just the daily struggle. A gnawing hunger, not just for food, but for something more.  \n\nThere's a truth in the wreckage. Couldn't have survived this long without them.  Family. Friends.  A lifeline thrown in the face of the storm.   They held me up when the world spun dark. And believe me, when the real darkness comes, you find yourself small, insignificant, helpless.\n\nLife, it throws its punches.  Big ones.  Little ones.  No matter the armor you wear, some blows are too heavy to bear alone.\n\nThey talk of rugged individualism.  Of leaning on yourself. But look back. What sustained our fathers?  Not grit alone. It was kindness, a hand reaching out, a shared burden. The wagon trains, the pioneers, they crossed the land together.  They understood the strength in unity.\n\nSo yes, be ready. Have your supplies, your shelter, your plans.  I do.  The canned goods, the water filters, the tools.  But don't forget the other things.  The human connection.  Reach out your hand.  Ask for help. Offer it.  Build a community.  That's the real strength.",
            "The question of form, of how life takes the shape it does, has haunted man since he first looked upon the world. Why do creatures take the forms they do? Are there unseen hands guiding their evolution, some force shaping the course of change? Even now, a century after Thompson's lament that the zoologist could scarce dream of defining organic forms in numbers, the mystery remains. \n\nYet, men have sought to chart this course, to find the equations that govern the dance of life. They've used the language of mathematics to trace the growth of mollusks, the unfolding of their shells through time and space. Our own work seeks to unravel this mystery in the case of Prunum, these spiral-shelled creatures of the deep. We've taken to X-rays, peering into their silent forms, measuring, quantifying the curves and contours of their shells. These numbers then feed a machine, a digital forge called CerioShell, where hypothetical forms are born, possibilities explored. \n\nThe shell, itself, is a marvel. A tube winding through time, through 360 degrees of space. Each twist, each coil, a whorl, spiraling around an unseen axis, the columella. The speed of its growth, the size of its aperture, all tell a story, a silent chronicle of life's journey.  \n\nWe look at these shells from all sides, apical, basal, apertural, abapertural, seeking to understand the language of their form. We count the whorls, each a chapter in their history, and trace the path of the aperture, the mouth of the creature, as it moves through time and space.  \n\nIf we can understand this path, this trajectory, then perhaps we can begin to unravel the secrets of evolution, the forces that shape life's grand design.",
            "The death of babes in the cradle, the passing of infants, it clung to Indonesia like a shroud. For a decade, the toll remained a constant shadow.  The country, they said, was striving for the sun, chasing the Millennium's promises of water and clean living. Yet the health of mothers and children, that remained in the dark. Progress was a whisper, a sigh against the wind. The reasons, they would say, were many. A web of shortcomings, a call for a stronger hand to guide the whole of the health system, not just singular threads of intervention.\n\nThey spoke of births attended by hands skilled in the ways of healing. Seventy-two percent, they claimed, a number that rang hollow. For what use are midwives' touch when storms of complications rage? Hemorrhage, a silent thief, stole mothers in the night. A fragile facade of progress, a mirage in the desert. And the children, they suffered too. Diarrheal fever, a scourge, claimed its victims with a chilling frequency, left untended by the healing hands. Postnatal care, a whispered prayer, unanswered in too many corners.\n\nCesarean births, a scar on the flesh, were rare. Four percent, a meager offering. The shadows of inequity stretched long. In cities, the steel-eyed surgeon's hand was common. In the villages, a shadow lingered, a mere two percent. Access, a privilege, a gulf between the haves and the have-nots.  The poor, burdened by the weight of cost, were left adrift on a sea of despair.\n\nWhat then, the question lingered, how to mend the broken threads? Should they weave a tapestry of targeted programs, or strengthen the loom that held the whole fabric of health? The allure of the singular thread was strong. A quicker fix, a more manageable knot. But beware the pitfalls. For the weight of one program, one intervention, could pull down the threads of others. The shadow of funding, a fickle beast, would consume all, leaving other areas starved. And the endless duplication, a maddening labyrinth of forms and whispers, would choke the life out of the system.",
            "Victorian fictions, they swarm with detail, fixated on the powdered wigs and silks of a dying age. Yet some, like *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, they turn away from the gilded cage. These tales spin a thread of mystery, a touch of the uncanny, a deviation from the expected, sharpening the edges of their characters, laying bare the gnawing hunger that drives them, the shadows that dance in their hearts. \n\n*He was caught in a maelstrom of thoughts, a howling wilderness in his mind. The voices of Sikes and Crackit, their words like stones thrown against a skull, echoed in the chambers of his soul. He was both witness and participant, caught in a tangled web of their malice. Then, a sudden crack, a flash of light, a roar that split the night. A tumult of cries and shouts, a kaleidoscope of flickering flames, and he, a puppet in unseen hands, was dragged away. Through it all, a dull ache, a persistent throb of pain, a gnawing fear that clenched at his insides.*\n\nThese tales weave their mysteries in dreams, in visions that bleed into waking hours. In *Oliver Twist*, these phantasmagorias dig into the boy's soul, revealing the festering wounds, the terror that festers beneath the surface. When the bullet finds its mark, when Oliver is reborn in the crucible of death, he relives it all in a haze of fragmented memories, a nightmare he cannot escape. The passage speaks of helplessness, a soul adrift in a sea of pain. His senses are numbed, the world a blur of color and sound. He is a leaf tossed by the wind, carried away by forces beyond his control.\n\nThe shooting, it is not just a wound, it's a reflection of his powerlessness. He cannot fight, cannot even try to fight. His despair is palpable, a heavy shroud woven by Fagin's grim hand. It is a surrender, a slow acceptance of fate, a resignation to the cruel whims of a world that offers no solace. \n\n*The day bled into the night, a fleeting shadow against the canvas of eternity. There was no day, only the endless expanse of night, a suffocating silence broken only by the whisper of the wind.*",
            "A couple of years back I was workin' in one of them after-school programs, tutorin' the young'uns. Elementary kids, mostly. Tried to lend a hand wherever they needed it, but English and readin' was my strong suit. \n\nOld man Johnson, the program director, he pulled me aside one day. Said there was this boy, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, stuggledin' somethin' fierce with readin'. Seems to me somethin' were off. He'd pronounce some letters clean as a whistle, others like they were foreign tongue. Strange, real strange. Little fella was Latino, that much I knew, though he talked English like a born speaker.\n\nWe battled with it, day after day, till the day his mama walked in. I was mindin' a handful of strays while the rest of the kids were gone on some field trip, when she came in. Didn't speak a lick of English, her. Just Spanish. My Spanish was shakier than a newborn colt, just learnin' myself, but we managed a sort of conversation. And then it hit me, like a stray bullet,  Adrian weren't readin' wrong, he just didn't know the damn alphabet. Didn't know it like the back of his hand. \n\nDon't know if that ever did him much good, but I hope he's doin' alright.\n\nSee, I tell this story 'cause it's about the language barrier, the wall that stands in the way in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as clear cut as you think. Even a kid who speaks English like a songbird, readin' can be a hard climb. \n\nWe all agree this problem exists, right? So what the hell do we do? In Adrian's case, it was simple enough: a tutor, a good eye on the alphabet, how to sound out the words. But for kids who barely speak English at all, it's a different beast altogether. No easy answers there. Dual language programs, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of it's a magic bullet. It takes all of it, mixed together, like a good stew.\n\nFirst off, dual language programs ain't just for kids whose first tongue is Spanish. It's for everybody. Studies say kids in these programs, they learn better, faster. A lot of folks scared of those programs, thinkin' they waste money, that most kids won't get nothin' outta it. But that's a lie. If we made these programs the rule, not the exception, every kid would benefit.\n\nHow do we do it? Make every teacher bilingual? Now that's a tall order, ain't it? Unrealistic, maybe. But we can have assistants, tutors, call 'em what you will, folks who speak both languages.",
            "From the time a man first draws breath, the word is whispered: there's something out there. Bigger. Beyond knowing. Some are taught in houses of worship, some seek answers in the hush of their own souls. Many take the creed of their fathers, a worn map passed down through generations. But some, born defiant, deny the shadows, clinging tight to the small sphere of their own making.  They build their own shrines, their own gods, only to find them crumbling in the dust. We all walk a path, carving our own hollows in the endless night, searching for a flicker, a spark in the dark to guide us.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, smoke curling from his lips, the air thick with rain. We sat on the porch, the tin roof a drum against the storm. The gutters funneled water, drowning the brittle weeds at the edge. He looked out, eyes distant, lost in the drumming gray. Skin stretched thin over bone, his clothes hanging loose on a frame grown frail. Hair, once thick, now a sparse dusting on his head. He didn't meet my gaze. I felt the cold tug at my chest, a fear that choked the words. How could I speak of the chasm opening before us, of the inevitability of his passing?  So I held him, felt the tremor in his hand, and sat beside him, sharing the unsettling silence, the rain a constant, steady beat against the twilight.\n\nHe died in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The poisons they used, they kept him from the dirt a few months longer, but at what cost? The question hung in the air, unanswered, a bitter taste on my tongue. What god, I thought, would let this happen?  Alone in the darkness, I didn't pray. If he existed, he'd stopped listening long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to watch him go. The man who'd shaped me, the lifeblood of my being, fading into the void. I chose to remember him as he was, not as he'd become. I knew him better than anyone, better than his own blood. I knew he wouldn't want me there, a witness to his final breaths. So I curled in my bed for days, waiting for the news, the phone silent, a hollow space where his voice should have been.",
            "The Gothic, Watt calls it an oxymoron, \"Old-New.\" A contradiction in terms. Praised and damned, lauded for its terrible sublime, accused of being hollow.  Walpole, in his Castle of Otranto, the first of its kind, wove together the threads of ancient and modern romances. A new tapestry of words, stitched with echoes of the old theatricality, the raw mimicry of nature found in those newer, humbler tales. An \"old\" story, he called it, a Gothic Story.\n\nThe word itself, \"Gothic,\" a relic, a whisper from a time long past. Used to mark tribes and styles and ages, always cast as archaic, a shadow in the face of progress. Yet, in its shadow, a new light flickered.  The novel, a format still fresh, allowed the reader a glimpse into the mind, a close communion with the soul of the characters. This paradox, the ancient and the new, bound together in the Gothic, this is its enduring power. It remains both a fossil and a bloom, strange and familiar to those who read it centuries hence.\n\nChivalry, a ghost from the medieval halls, lingers in these stories. The training of a knight, the ideal of honor and courage, a reflection perhaps of what the writers saw lacking in their own time. Walpole, caught in the maelstrom of politics, facing whispers and accusations, may have yearned for that lost virtue. He saw it in the past, idealized and romanticized, a beacon in the darkness.\n\nFrederic, a character in the Castle, stands as a testament.  He is described, a prince, a figure of tragedy, marked by suffering and loss. The image is grand, a knight in shining armor, though exaggerated, a hint of the excess to come. Yet, even in the shadow of the impossible, there is a truth, a yearning for a world where honor still held sway.",
            "The flow of things. From want to want.  Goods snaking through the dark, a chain of bones, starting with the desire in the customer's eye. It winds back, a tendril of need, to raw material, to the forge, the factory floor, the rumble of trucks, and back again to the waiting hands. This chain, they call it \"Supply Chain Management\". A word coined in the year 1982 by a man named Oliver, a shepherd of commerce. He spoke of planning, of moving the pieces, of control, all to sate the insatiable appetite of the consumer. Six things, he said, are the hinges on which this chain swings: production, supply, the hoarding of stock, the choosing of place, the conveyance of goods, and the whispering of information.  \n\nProduction. The heart of the beast. It is here the blueprints are laid, the when, the why, the where, the how. The manager, a cartographer of need, must chart the desires of the market, the shifting sands of want. For what is produced must be what is craved.  He digs deep into the belly of the beast, seeking the pulse of demand.  What will sell? How much? Where will it be forged, in what crucible of steel and toil?  This is the manager's burden. He must weigh the cost, the time, the quality, all against the fickle whims of the customer.\n\nThen comes the dance of supply, the intricate weaving of partnerships, the choosing of allies. Different divisions, each with their own skills, their own tools, their own sweat.  The manager, a conductor of this orchestra, must decide where each piece will play.  Sometimes, the work is outsourced, a delegation of labor to strangers, a gamble on speed and cost.  Velocity, they call it, the ability to dance faster, cheaper, better.",
            "The sign hung crooked in the dust, a stark black square against the sunbaked air. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it read, scrawled in the hurried hand of a woman with eyes that looked too old for her face. Ellen Page. Juno. She stood alone, a lone figure amidst the city's clamor, a whisper in the wind. \n\nBurma. A name that tasted of dust and decay. A country swallowed by shadows, ruled by men with iron in their souls and shadows in their hearts. \n\nThey came to power in a night of blood, a coup that cleaved the nation in two. Monks, robed in saffron, had dared to rise, their voices a fragile tremor against the junta's iron fist. A revolution of saffron, they called it. But the silence was soon broken by the crackle of gunfire, the screams swallowed by the dust. Monasteries, once sanctuaries, lay in ruins, their sacred silence shattered by the thunder of tanks.\n\nThe world turned its eyes away. A photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, caught in the crossfire, his camera shutter forever silent. A thousand silent screams, buried beneath the weight of a government's lies. \n\nThis, however, is not new. The hunger for power, the thirst to crush dissent, it is a serpent that coils within the heart of man. From Caesar's Rome to the gilded cages of emperors, the story repeats. \n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity drowned in a tide of bullets. The ghosts of a thousand fallen souls whispering in the wind. Rwanda, a butcher's field, where the blood of innocents stained the earth crimson.  And the Third Reich, a nightmare painted in ash and the stench of death. \n\nThe cycle spins. The serpent coils. And the world watches, a silent witness to the horrors that unfold.",
            "The man, Ellington, he left his mark on that jazz music, a long shadow cast by years of work and a hand that knew how to coax the best from his men. The piano, it ain't always the star in his music, but as a composer, he built worlds, intricate and dark, where each man could sing his own song. He'd lay down the bones of a tune, a framework for improvisation, then build up around it, weaving in threads of brass and reed, each note chosen to fit the soul of the player. His sound, it was his own, a tapestry woven from the individual voices, a symphony of grit and grace.  \n\nThe Grove folks, they called him innovative. They talked about \"Creole Love Call\" and the way he used that voice, not for words, but for texture, for color. Like a new instrument, the voice bled into the music, a moan or a cry, adding depth to the blues. He knew how to lift his men, how to make their talents shine. That piece, \"Creole Love Call,\" it was a slow burn, twelve bars of soul, six choruses unfolding like a story.  \n\nFirst, a call and response between voice and woodwinds, the voice smooth at first, then rough, like a wound opening up. Then the trumpet, muted, whispering a mournful melody, stretching out those blue notes. The clarinet, it took flight, a sweet and soaring solo, backed by a piano that tickled the edges. Then the whole band, echoing the first chorus, a conversation between brass and reeds. And the fifth, that was the climax, the reeds rising, their voices ragged and raw, backed by a stop-time rhythm that pulsed like a heartbeat. Back to the beginning for the last chorus, the voice now a growl, an instrument of pain and power. A final tag, a vocal run, a trombone crying out in dissonance, and it was over.\n\nThat was Ellington, a master of sound, a weaver of dreams. He took what was simple and made it complex, he took the ordinary and turned it into something beautiful and strange. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he laid it all down, the tight orchestration, the ear for tone color. A muted trumpet, a scat singer, their voices blending into one, a conversation between instruments and words. And in \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" he used Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, his trombone, to sing the melody, a mournful cry that echoed through the night.",
            "The need had been a gnawing in her belly since she was fourteen, a hunger that no earthly thing could sate. It had bloomed with the first blush of womanhood, a strange ache that tightened with each passing year. Three years on, at seventeen, she'd come to understand it wasn't for things she yearned, but for someone. A companion. Yet no boy had ever stirred the slumbering fire within. Some had tried, clumsy and awkward in their pursuit of the unyielding, but none had come close. She wracked her brain, trying to decipher the riddle of her own heart. What strange alchemy could brew such a thing in a girl on the cusp of womanhood? Theories had bloomed and withered like desert flowers, leaving her thirsty still.  \n\nDays at home were usually quiet. Her parents were good folk, rooted in the earth, their lives a gentle hum of routine. They rarely raised their voices, and their arguments with her were as rare as locusts in a drought. The only discord came when she chafed against their stillness, her own spirit a whirlwind of restless energy. She was the daughter of calm, but a storm in her own right, her laughter and light a beacon in their quiet world.\n\nBut this day hung heavy, the air thick with an unspoken tension. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration in the mundane, a sharp cry sliced through the quiet. Her mother's voice, a melody broken and strained. She flew to the kitchen, fear a bitter taste on her tongue. \"Mother?\" she breathed, her voice a desperate plea.\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, a crumpled figure amidst the scattered clutter. A whimper escaped her lips, a strangled \"Ow\" that spoke of agony.\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\nShe knelt beside her, her hand reaching out, trembling. \"What is it? What happened?\"\n\nPain contorted her mother's features. \"Sweet... take me... to the hospital.\"\n\nHer words were shards of broken glass, her voice a whisper on the wind.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nHer mother's hand, clammy and cold, pointed towards the back door.\n\nShe knew then, a surge of fierce determination welling within her, that her mother needed her. That the calm she had known was shattered, and only she could hold it together.\n\nShe had spent her youth training, honing her strength, driven by a need she hadn't understood. Now, that need found its purpose. Lifting her mother, she felt the weight of her body, a burden she wouldn't shirk. She carried her to the car, her muscles burning, her breath ragged.\n\nThe hospital, a sterile landscape of pain and fear, swallowed them whole. The scent of disinfectant and sickness hung heavy in the air, but her mind was a single, unwavering point: her mother.\n\nShe pushed through the throngs of worried faces, her voice a command. \"Help! Help my mother!\"\n\nA rolling bed materialized, a lifeline in the sea of despair. They rushed her mother away, leaving her alone, her heart a drumbeat against her ribs, fear a cold hand gripping her throat.\n\nThey had told her it was a fall. A simple fall from a stepladder, reaching for a vase placed too high. But she knew, deep in her bones, that it was more than that. A broken vase was a small thing, a symbol of a larger fracture, a crack in the fabric of their world.",
            "The study sought to lay bare the link between a way of eating they called the “Mediterranean Diet” —  or aMed,  a stricter measure — and the harsh realities of heart disease and stroke.  The aMed, it was claimed, meant to favor the bounty of the earth: plants in all their forms, nuts and grains, fish swimming in the sea, and oils pressed from olives.  It shunned the flesh of animals and the fat that clung to them, save for a measured sip of wine.\n\nBefore, whispers had circulated about this diet and its power.  Some said it kept the heart strong, others that it lengthened the years.  But these stories lacked focus, failing to pinpoint the threat of stroke and its cold, silent hand.\n\nThis study, a long watch over a cohort of 74,886 women, their years stretching from 38 to 63, sought to shed light on these shadows.  These women, nurses tending to the sick, had been followed for two decades, their habits chronicled in questionnaires that asked them to recall what had nourished their bodies.  More than ninety-five percent remained steadfast in their duty, their stories woven into the fabric of the study.\n\nEach year, they were questioned, their tales of what they ate analyzed and weighed against the stark records of illness.  Heart attacks, strokes, their grim pronouncements, were confirmed by the cold hand of medical records or the finality of death certificates.  Where records were lost, the whispers persisted, their stories deemed \"probable\" but still woven into the tapestry.\n\nThe researchers, meticulous and watchful, accounted for every factor that could cloud their vision: age, the habit of smoking, the weight they bore, the changes that came with menopause, and the treatments they sought.\n\nAt last, they turned their gaze to the aMed score, a measure of adherence to the way of eating, and its link to the grim outcomes.  They found that the women who best embraced the aMed, who walked in step with its rhythms, were less vulnerable to the heart's betrayals and the sudden darkness of stroke.\n\nOver two decades, the toll was tallied:  2391 heart attacks, 1763 strokes, and 1077 lives extinguished by these silent killers.  The women at the crest of the aMed ladder, those who walked most closely with its wisdom, were shielded from these fates.  Their risk was diminished, a testament to the power of the food that nourished them.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, a house built on sand, began to crack. The specter of unemployment stretched long and lean across the land. Houses, once symbols of promise, stood empty, monuments to a broken system. Corporations, giants of industry, toppled like dominoes, their foundations rotted by greed. This sickness, this recession, it lingers still, a shadow across the nation's soul. How did it come to this? How did the heart of the nation beat so erratically, its pulse faltering? The answer lies in the halls of power, in the decisions made by men more interested in personal gain than the common good.\n\nBanks, pressured by unseen hands,  lent freely to the undeserving, handing out sub-prime loans like cheap whiskey. These loans, like poisoned fruit, corrupted the very fabric of the financial world. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, once pillars of stability, were twisted into instruments of this decay. They churned these toxic mortgages into complex securities, packaging them like so much illicit cargo, peddling them to unsuspecting investors. When the music stopped, the borrowers defaulted, leaving banks shorn of their capital, their balance sheets bleeding, and the contagion spreading like wildfire through the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this catastrophe were sown long ago, in the twilight of the Clinton years. In the pursuit of a second term, the President sought to manipulate the levers of power, to bolster his popularity with promises of easy credit. The lending restrictions, once safeguards against ruin, were relaxed. The stage was set, the drama unfolding, a tragedy in slow motion.\n\nHolmes, a scribe from the New York Times, saw the storm brewing. He wrote in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" He warned, his words echoing with prescience, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nThe complexity of the financial instruments themselves, these intricate mortgages and repackaged debts, only deepened the mire. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations – their names whispered with dread – entangled the nation's financial system in a web of interdependency.\n\nAnd then came the crash. The housing bubble, inflated to monstrous proportions, burst with a deafening roar. The financial institutions, their portfolios filled with toxic assets, were left reeling. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers crumbled into dust, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, once titans of Wall Street, were forced to beg for government scraps. Fannie and Freddie, their balance sheets crippled by mortgage debt, were brought under the iron fist of the state.",
            "Exposition. A word that hangs in the air like smoke from a dying fire. A place in the story where the writer might try to take flight, to soar with words that shine like burnished steel. Or it might be the place where the reader's eyes glaze over, where the mind wanders to more pleasant fields. Dr. Merlin, she's been known to let out a bellow when she's lost in the thicket of Too Much Telling. Not the pleasant kind of bellow, mind you.\n\nTruth is, exposition ain't your friend.\n\nYou know the old saying: show, don't tell. But even a seasoned hand like Dr. Merlin can get caught in the trap of long stretches of words that ain't leading nowhere. It's that little devil on the writer's shoulder, whispering to get the history out of the way, to get to the good parts. Not the other devil, of course, the one that insists on telling you the childhood woes of every last character.\n\nExposition, it's the blunt instrument of storytelling.  Telling the reader what happened, in plain, unembellished prose.  Like a sailor reciting the tale of a long voyage, dumping a whole sea of words on a captive audience. In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nTake a story, for instance. You're told the heroine met her love in a certain place, at a certain time. They married, grandly, and then her husband, he was murdered right before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this whole saga to stretch out over two pages, with the couple only uttering a few words between them. You'd expect the author to linger on the husband, to show you his heart through his words, through his manner. You'd see the way his presence filled the heroine's world, how she blossomed under his gaze. If the story later tells you this was the case, you'd want to see it, to feel it, not just be told.  A well-drawn husband, he'd draw you in, make you feel the weight of his loss, and in that loss, you'd feel the heroine's pain more deeply.\n\nYou see, good writing, it gives you the meat on the bone. It takes that simple story, the \"They met, they married, he died,\" and it fleshes it out, makes it real.\n\n\nSometimes, it's tempting to rush past things.  A new character, maybe.  He was in the Air Force, now he runs a gas station at night.  Twice married, no kids.  Likes to fish on Sundays. Dreams of owning the place someday.  Had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.  \n\nBut the writer, she has to slow down.  She has to let the reader see those things, not just hear them.",
            "The flicker in the box showed two stories from Columbus, Ohio. First, NBC 4, live this morning, August 13th, 2011. A man in Ashley, Ohio, had taken a knife to his wife. They didn't name her, but his name was Shad Hostettler. His picture, a mug shot, stared back, all hard angles and shadowed eyes. The kind of face that might hold the devil's own secrets. Two minutes they gave the story, all they could spare, before moving on. He'd stabbed her, they said, multiple times. Arrested. A quick account of a killing, swift and brutal. \n\nNext, a young man, Travis Buyers, eighteen. Shot in the Sharon Woods, early morning. Critically injured, they said. No arrests, no suspects. The SWAT team, like ghosts in the fog, picking at the pieces. This one felt shorter, swallowed down. A black man, shot in a black neighborhood. A truth you see if you know where to look. The media, they feast on white pain. A missing child, a white woman in distress, and the airwaves crackle with their plight. But a black man, a black life, it gets a whisper, a glance, if that. \n\nA hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, the next story. A .22, they said, from a rifle. Fired from somewhere in the dusk. Five thousand dollars, Crime-Stoppers offered, for information leading to the shooter.\n\nRain and thunderstorms, the forecast. Mid-eighties, they said, the weekend a swelter. Short, they made it, a tease for the anxious eye. \n\nThen, a robbery, a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, they said, wearing a hoodie. Six feet tall, one hundred and fifty pounds. They lingered on the details, the darkness of his skin, like it was the defining truth.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a drug kingpin from Texas, caught in the net.  Conspiracy to distribute marijuana, they said, a flood of green from Texas to Ohio. Twenty-five years, they said, a harsh sentence.  Or 300 months, a colder, more deliberate way of saying it. And a Hispanic man, a detail that felt out of place, a whisper of a prejudice.",
            "The blood bond. A hard knot that ties men together, raw and unforgiving. It holds within it the dark heart of things: love, yes, but also the bitter tang of envy, the sting of cruelty. Brothers, they see each other like no other. Not as the world sees them, but as they truly are, a reflection staring back from a well of shared bone and blood. And it is in the stark light of extremity, when the world cracks open, that this bond reveals its true nature, for good or ill.\n\nThis knowing, this seeing, it comes with a price.  The consequences bloom like a poison flower, twisting around the roots of every thought, every action.  In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys, brothers bound by this terrible thing, walk a path of thorns.  The world they move through is thick, lush, alive, a green shroud hiding the rot beneath. They set out on a journey, a fool's errand, driven by the ache of pride and the gnawing sense of something broken. In the end, only one will walk away.\n\nThe story unfolds in the boy's own voice, a voice that is both hard and tender, haunted by the weight of what he's done and what he's seen. He sees himself reflected in the eyes of his younger brother, Doodle, a fragile thing, marked by weakness from the start. The older boy craves a different brother, one who can keep pace, one who can share in the wild, untamed world he envisions. But Doodle is different. He is a bird with clipped wings, forever tethered to the earth.\n\nThe boy's actions, driven by this desperate need for connection, are tangled with pride and anger. He sees Doodle as a burden, a shadow that stains the purity of his own desires. The dark thought takes root, a viper coiled in his heart, whispering of a simpler solution, a way to erase the problem. But then, a smile. A spark of light in the darkness. And the boy falters. The bond, despite its ugliness, holds him back.",
            "The mind. A tangled thicket of thought. They've tried to map it, these men of science, with their tablets of wax and their scrolls of papyrus. Then came the books, the printed word, and finally, the cold steel logic of the machine. But the mind, it ain't no machine. No clockwork contraption. It's a fire, burning bright and fierce, consuming and transforming. \n\nIt takes in the world through senses raw and unfiltered: touch, heat, sound, light. Each a whisper in the dark, turned into whispers of electricity. The brain, it sifts through these whispers, decoding the patterns, building meaning from chaos. Like a sculptor chipping away at stone, it shapes the raw material into something recognizable. A box against a white void. A face in the crowd.\n\nBut there's more to it than just seeing. The mind, it has a filter, a watchful eye that decides what's worth keeping and what's to be cast aside. It lets you see the blade of grass, yet ignores the million others. It picks out your name in a cacophony of sound. A beacon in the storm.\n\nAnd then there's the holding, the storing. Memories, like ghosts, flit through the mind. Some linger a fleeting moment, others stay for a lifetime. Echoes in the chambers of the soul.  They say the mind, it weaves these memories into proteins, a tapestry of experience. \n\nThey've tried to map it, these scientists. Tried to find the patterns, the connections. But the mind, it's a labyrinth, a place of shadows and light. It defies easy explanation. It is, in the end, a mystery.",
            "The wind whispered through the chrome canyons of Huxley's Brave New World, a world where comfort was king and the individual a ghost. The air itself hummed with the low thrum of machinery, a constant reminder of the iron grip technology held on the soul.  And at the heart of it all, the engine of commerce, a machine that churned out happiness like a factory churning out widgets. \n\nHuxley saw it coming, the shadow of this gilded cage. He saw the way the masses, conditioned from birth, chased fleeting pleasures, their minds dulled by the constant drip of manufactured contentment. They were pawns, each one, in a game played by the World Controller, their desires molded, their thoughts pre-sorted, their wills surrendered. \n\nHe spoke of homogeny, of reification, words that resonated with the echoes of Marx, a ghost in the machine. For Huxley saw the threads of capitalism, the tendrils that choked the life out of the human spirit. False consciousness, he called it, a veil woven from the threads of desire, obscuring the true nature of their servitude. \n\nThe lower castes, Deltas and Gammas, lived in a fog of instant gratification, their need for consumption their only driving force. Hypnopædia, a sleep-learning device, pumped the mantra of consumerism into their dreams, a constant whisper urging them to buy, to spend, to be empty vessels filled with things. \n\nAnd the alphas, the Betas, they saw it, but they were complicit. Ensconced in their gilded cages, they turned a blind eye to the suffering below. For they, too, were part of the machine, their own desires carefully curated, their freedom an illusion. \n\nLove, true love, was a ghost in this world. The characters moved through their lives like puppets, their interactions shallow, transactional. The men saw women as objects, their bodies gleaming under the fluorescent lights. The women spoke of their encounters with a clinical detachment, their emotions carefully controlled.\n\nHuxley painted a bleak picture, a world where technology and capitalism had devoured the soul, leaving behind a hollow shell of humanity. A world where the individual was nothing, a cog in the vast machine of progress.  He showed us the mirror, and in its reflection, we saw the shadows of our own future.",
            "The stone buildings of University Park had held me for two and a half years, four and a half semesters. Getting across this spread, this campus, was a trial for many, myself included. My first year, I was lodged in East Halls, near as far east as you could go, save for the steel and concrete behemoths they called stadium and center. Willard, a stone's throw from the heart of it all, felt a county away. A quarter hour, maybe half, afoot, if the sky wasn't weeping, which it often did in this place.\n\nAn old boy, not much different from myself, told me that the East Halls were once islands, surrounded by fields and silence. Now, those fields were choked with gridirons and brick and mortar, new buildings like the Creamery and a place for healing. Apartments ringed the whole thing, a concrete embrace. The campus grew, ate itself alive, and the paths grew ever more convoluted. What then was a boy to do?\n\nThe bicycle, I reckoned. But a bike alone was a hollow promise. It took a rider, a will, and a world built for wheels.\n\nI spoke with a friend, a man who'd rediscovered the two-wheeled path after years of neglect. \"Why'd I ever stop?\" he said, a grin on his face. \"They're too damn good. A few years, it wasn't cool. Now, it's just the way to get around.\"\n\nGood for the body, good for the soul, efficient as a bolt of lightning. Oatmeal and sweat, you could cover miles.\n\nThese days I live beyond the campus, as far from the center as some of those dorm rooms. The smartest thing I did? Bought a bike. Thomas building, where I spend most of my days, a twenty-five-minute walk from my door. A bike? Five minutes, if I pushed hard enough.\n\nThere's a road, Pollock Road, straight as an arrow, but treacherous. A storm of metal and noise, even for a bike. Walking's fine, but I haven't the time. Without the bike, I'd be walking, stuck in the muck of time. Thirty, forty minutes every day, that's two and a half hours a week. Add to that the rest, the appointments, the errands, and I'd be lost in the labyrinth."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The work of tending to the broken, to the children bruised and battered by the world's indifference, has called to me for some time. It is a path I see myself walking, amongst those lost in the labyrinth of family and neglect, with the Division of Family and Children Services. To serve, to respect, to hold fast to the thin line of what is ethical, these are the cornerstones I bring to the table. Not just for the work, but for the living of it. \n\nIt's a calling that's been there, a whisper in the wind since youth. I've seen folks turn away from their troubles, bury them deep, or lash out in ways that leave scars deeper than the flesh.  A bachelor's in psychology, a degree earned at Piedmont College in '09, offered some understanding but not a guidepost.  A summer break stretched before me, uncertain. Then, a friend introduced me to a boy, sixteen years old, perched on her worn couch, his eyes shadowed with fear. He was running, fleeing the storm of his own home, abused by the hands that should have protected him. The next day, news came that he'd called the police. I drove to his house, drawn by a need to help, a graduate with a degree and a heart full of questions.  The law, it seemed, had turned away.  His parents, pale and slick with nervous sweat, spun tales of a manipulative child, twisting the truth to shield themselves. It was then, in that flickering light of a summer evening, that the path became clear. I would be a voice for the voiceless, a shield for the broken.\n\nThis work, it demands more than just compassion. It demands a fire in the belly, a hunger for justice. We speak of the individual, of their worth, yet we strive to mold them all into the same shape, to fit them into the cracks of conformity.  I refuse to be a cog in that machine. My actions have always spoken louder than words: colors on my hair, clothes that defied the norm, piercings that challenged tradition. I stood with the GSBA, a banner against the tide of prejudice.  I fight against injustice wherever I see it, a lone voice against the chorus of silence.",
            "The paper takes on the weigh of the Biological and Sociocultural models, set against the landscape of insomnia. The Biological model, a stark terrain of genes passed down and the body's own ailments, holds sway. The Sociocultural, it peers into the shadows of environment, tracing the lines of race, ethnicity, and the weight of circumstance.  This review seeks to traverse these models, charting the course of each study chosen to illuminate their paths. The findings, like whispers in the wind, are then laid bare, their strengths and weaknesses exposed to the light.\n\nSleep disorder, a beast with many heads, can be many things: primary, born of the mind itself; secondary, a shadow of another illness; or a consequence of some unseen ailment or the taking of strange substances. The Primary sleep disorders, Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, stand as sentinels. Dyssomnias –  Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and the unnamed Dyssomnia – these are the troubles that plague the act of sleeping itself. The Parasomnias, on the other hand, are the nightmares made flesh – Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and the rest, a symphony of unsettling occurrences. Sleep disorders entwined with other mental ailments are bound to the weight of Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review, however, focuses on insomnia, a wanderer in the night, and the broader realm of primary sleep disorders, viewed through the lenses of the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model, a map of flesh and blood, points to the genes we inherit and the body's own whispers.  Neurons in the hypothalamus, those tiny stars in the darkness, contain orexin, the conductor of sleep and wakefulness.  One study, conducted on mice, has illuminated the presence of GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, receptors that hold the key to sleep's embrace. When activated, they usher in the gentle embrace of sleep. But when silenced, anxiety recedes, and slumber comes calling. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, has been shown to lengthen the hours of sleep in these small creatures (Matsuki et al., 2009). This, perhaps, holds a mirror to our own sleep-deprived condition, suggesting that the genetic and environmental blueprints that shape these receptors in mice might echo in us as well. A flawed receptor, a missing piece, could be the silent architect of sleepless nights, a thief of rest, leaving us to grapple with the mundane and the meaningful alike. The Sociocultural implications are stark: If this phenotype is inherited, the ability to sleep, a fundamental human need, could be irrevocably altered. The impact, a ripple through the fabric of life, would touch the schoolroom, the workplace, and the everyday struggles of focus and concentration.",
            "The wind whispers of a darkness in the ear, a hollowness where sound should be. This paper will speak of this shadow, of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD as the learned men call it. First, a glimpse at the nature of the affliction. Then, the signs, the whispers that betray its presence. And finally, a path, a light in the dark, for those tasked with guiding a child through the labyrinth of sound.\n\nCAPD, they say, is a failure of the mind to translate the world's whispers into meaning. The ear itself may catch the sound, but the brain, that great echo chamber, fails to make sense of it. It is a deafness of the soul, not of the ear. Words blur, voices blend, and the world becomes a cacophony of indistinguishable noise.\n\nThe shadow has been known since the mid-century, first called \"auditory imperception.\"  Like a ghost, it has haunted the halls of science, studied by men like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, and Kimura, who sought to map its presence. A conference in '77, a tremor in the earth, brought the whispers into the light.\n\nCAPD wears many faces. It can be the inability to locate sound, to discern one voice from another, to follow the thread of a conversation. It can be the inability to hear the music in the world, the subtle shifts in tone that speak volumes. The world becomes a flat, featureless landscape where sound is but a dull roar.\n\nTo diagnose this affliction, one must listen closely, not just to the words, but to the silences, the hesitations, the missed cues. Tests abound, some simple, some complex, probing the mind for signs of the shadow. But there is no single key, no map to unravel its mystery. The cause, shrouded in darkness, remains elusive.",

But the mask, it isolates. It cuts a man off from the warmth of his own kind. And in this case, it even bloomed into a twisted love, a love born of misunderstanding. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\"  And the ghost of a love unacknowledged, a love that should never have been, lingered between Viola and Orsino.  \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nThis, perhaps, is the play's true heart.  That deception can force truth to the surface, to twist and writhe beneath the skin.  Did Olivia love Cesario for the man he pretended to be, or did she see a reflection of her own hidden desires?  A dangerous question, one that lingers in the shadows.  But the play offers no easy answers.  It is a story of masks and shadows, of love that blooms in the dark and truth that bleeds out like a wound.",
            "The iron fist of the German Reich had left its mark on the land, a stain of blood on the sand. The Ovaherero and Namaqua, driven to their knees, their bones scattered like dust in the wind.  But a single brushstroke cannot capture the whole canvas.  The Kaiser’s empire, vast and sprawling, held within it a thousand shades of cruelty.  Each colony a whisper of a different song, sung in different tongues, under a thousand different suns.  \n\nSo it was with education.  In Tanganyika, the British found a people stirred, a spark of knowledge kindled by the Germans.  In Kamerun, too, the word spread, carried on the backs of birds and the whispers of the wind.  But in South West Africa, a different story unfolded.\n\nThere, the iron grip was tighter, colder.  The government, distant and uncaring, left the burden of teaching to the missionaries, their hands stained with the same blood that soaked the ground.  The whites, they were different.  They were given schools, their minds oiled with knowledge, their thirst for power quenched by schooling.  But the natives?  They were left to wander in the shadows, their spirits untamed, their minds untouched.\n\nThe scars of this neglect ran deep, a wound that festered long after the Germans had packed their bags and moved on.  While other colonies boasted of literate men and women, South West Africa remained steeped in darkness, a land where the majority remained silent, unlearned, and unseen.  \n\nThis is the story I seek to tell: the story of South West Africa, a story of neglect and indifference, a story of a people denied their birthright. I will delve into the heart of the matter, unearthing the whispers of the past, the secrets buried beneath the sands of time.  I will examine the attitudes of the settlers, the cold calculus of colonial power, and the weight of history that crushed the dreams of a nation.",
            "The music they call popular, it's spread out like a stain across a century.  Genres bloom and wither, echoes of one another, rock and country, jazz and folk, all tangled together like weeds in a field. But the noise they call heavy metal, that's a different story. It's a thing that hungers, a beast with a thousand heads, each one howling its own darkness.\n\nIt started forty years back, a whisper in the shadows.  But soon enough, men saw the power in it, the way it could twist and turn, contort itself into something new.  They carved out their own little niches, their own private hells, each more elaborate than the last. Now the whole world's drowning in it.\n\nThey say it's music, this metal. But it's more than that. It's a fever dream, a soundtrack to the apocalypse. More bass, more volume, more fury than you could ever want.  It's a music of the flesh, the blood, the bone. It's a music that bleeds.\n\nAnd in its veins, there runs a current of sickness. Drugs, they say.  The haze of the seventies, it seeped into the marrow of the music, turned their minds inside out. They chased the shadows, the ghosts in the machine. They found something dark down there, something primal, something terrifying. \n\nThey sang of it, these metal men.  They sang of the darkness in us all, the beast that lies dormant beneath the skin. They sang of Helter Skelter, the Beatles' own descent into madness.  It was a warning, a glimpse into the abyss.  They were saying, listen. This is what happens when the music gets too loud.",
            "The sun bled across the canvas, long shadows stretching from the trees like the limbs of some slumbering giant. A woman stood there, eyes wide as the night sky, adrift in a landscape spun from dreams. She was a figure from another time, another world, a world Henri Rousseau had built with his own hands. \n\nDecades before the Surrealists, before they bled their visions onto the white walls, Rousseau had been crafting his own dreams.  His brushstrokes, thick and deliberate, were the scaffolding of his desires. The Dream, that canvas from 1910, was more than just a woman lost in wonder. It was Rousseau himself, wrestling with the demons of ambition. He yearned for the accolades of the world, the whispers of praise from those who knew the weight of a brushstroke.  But the path to recognition was a thorny one. \n\nHe could walk the well-worn paths of convention, mimicking the styles that hung in the gilded galleries, or he could forge his own way, his own truth, a path that might lead to solitude. The choice, like the dream itself, was a perilous one.\n\nRousseau's story was etched in the dust of his own life. Born into the bourgeois world, he had known neither the solace of fine art training nor the luxury of early acclaim. He toiled for the state, a gabelou, a man of numbers and tollbooths. His dreams were a refuge, a balm for the wounds inflicted by loss. He had buried children, wives, and dreams in the cold earth.  \n\nBut the hunger for recognition gnawed at him. He saw the masters, the prodigies who rose to fame in the Parisian salons, and he felt the sting of inadequacy.  He was an outsider, a man who painted with the heart of a peasant, not the polish of a Parisian.\n\nJan Gordon, in his book on the modern French painters, spoke of a kind of kinship between Rousseau and Matisse, two men who stood on opposite sides of the art world's divide. Matisse, a man who feared banality, and Rousseau, a man who craved acceptance.  Two souls driven by a thirst, one for originality, the other for belonging.",
            "The old talk, the one about beauty being truth and truth beauty, it ain't just talk.  There's a bone deep reason for it. Keats, he knew it.  \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" he said.  That's all you need to know, he said.\n\nWe learn a lot in life.  From books, from streets, from the sting of experience. But these things, ethics and beauty, they seep in different. You can't teach them like addition or the names of birds. They're not rules to be followed, but whispers in the dark. We try to explain them, sure, dissect a painting or a poem, talk about its parts. But it ain't the brushstrokes that make the Mona Lisa sing, or the words on the page that make a story bleed truth. There's a something, a ghost in the machine, that can't be nailed down.\n\nO'Connor, she knew it too. A story, she said, is a way to say what can't be said. A statement, that's too small.\n\nEven when we describe a thing to death, there's still a gap. An echo. And that's where the power lies. Wittgenstein, he said it plain: ethics can't be spoken. It's beyond words.  That's the connection between art and morality, that thing that sings in the bones. They both touch a place we can't quite reach.\n\nLiterature, it's the closest. McKean, he said it lives and breathes values. It's not just entertainment, it's a mirror held up to what matters. And maybe that's what makes us human, this need to find meaning in the messy beauty of it all.",
            "The German lands. They call it a strong nation now. United. A tapestry woven from the shadows of the Alps in München's cold embrace, stretching to Kiel's salt-bitten shores. This same blood runs through Köln, a river city on the Rhine, through the heart of the land, and out to Dresden, a Saxon city clinging to the Elbe. A land forged from many fires, many stories. \n\nGermania. The name itself a whisper from the past, a ghost story debated by men with books. Tacitus, he claimed it came from the Tungrians, a tribe before they crossed the Rhine, before the clash with the Gauls. (Tacitus, 98.) Caesar, he used the word \"Germanus\" in his tales of Gaul, a line drawn in the sand between the conquered and the unconquered. From the Gauls themselves he took it, a word to mark the difference. Some say it meant neighbor, a sound in a tongue long gone. Caesar, in the first chapter of his first book, wrote: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others speak of a spear, a \"ger\", or a shout, \"garim\", a word from the ancient Irish. The Germans, they were loud, they were fierce.\n\nTacitus, that old Roman, he wrote in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" a tale of beginnings. \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal,\" he wrote. \"Not mixed, not touched by other races.  Who would leave the warmth of Asia, the sun-baked sands of Africa, for this land? For Germany, with its wild heart, its skies that weep, its people with eyes that hold the shadows?\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not yet. They would come for trade, for gold, for the trinkets that whispered of a wilder land. They would come with their legions, their swords glinting in the sun, but they would go back, back to the empire that sprawled like a beast beneath the sun.\n\nThe Germanic tribes, they lived on the edges, on the border of the Roman world. They traded their wares, their furs and their skills. Some joined the ranks of the Roman legions, soldiers of fortune. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "Down I looked. The view a blank slate against the gray. Mind a still pond, reflecting without feeling. Eyes sharp, studying the contours, the shapes, the shades, but the mind, it held back. Thoughts flickered like fireflies, in and out, never settling. It was like a film passing through, a rush of images, no real meaning, just the cold, hard truth of what was there.\n\nOnce, a man I worked with, a painter, he gave me a book. \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" it was called. Said it could teach a man to see. To see the world not as it seemed, but as it was.  I'd wanted to draw since I was a boy, always watching, always wanting to capture the world on paper. The book, it talked about lines, about how the brain took those lines and made them mean something. It talked about framing, about taking a cluttered scene, a bowl of fruit on a table in a room, and making it simple, just the bowl, just the fruit, just the plane it sat on.\n\nAt that moment, staring down at this bowl, this brown bowl, I couldn't see the frame. I was lost in the details, the texture of the brown, the way it sat in the bowl, the way the light caught the curve of the sides. Picasso had his blues, Monet his greens, the Italians, they painted rainbows. If I was to paint, if I was to make something, this was it. This was the start. My brown world.\n\nMy hand reached out, fingers trembling, towards the brush, a stick of wood and bristles. Muscles tense, then relax, the hand moving, trying to make sense of the world. This could be it. This could be the moment.\n\nWater swirled, smooth and clear. A piece broke off, floated away, lost in the gray. Muscles tightened again, a jerky motion, a frantic push. The handle slammed against the porcelain. The brown, it wouldn't move. Stuck, clinging to the bottom of the bowl like a burr on a dog's fur.\n\n\nA mop, held loosely in my hand. Feet planted, tie a noose around my neck.  I stared at the brown mess, the offering left by some nameless soul. A few more flushes, a few more moments of silence, then my hand reached out, grabbed the paper, and began to wrap myself in it, like a mummy, until all that was left was a pale, white shape against the brown.\n\nStraightening, I bent down, my hand dipped into the bowl. A mother reaching into a hot oven, taking out her offering.",
            "The young ones are dying behind the wheel. A reckoning unfolds in the steel and glass cages they call cars. The sickness lies deep, in the marrow of the adolescent brain, not yet formed for the weight of the road. Inexperience, a hollow echo in the steel canyons, a siren song to the grave.  More crashes, more spills, more recklessness. Speeding, veering, a dance with oblivion.\n\nThey ride with their kind, these young ones, a pact sealed in the back seat. The numbers tell the tale, etched in blood and metal. California, a land of sun and shadows, has tried to hold them back, a provisional shield, a leash on the wild heart. But it's a bandage on a broken limb.\n\nThe truth is, they're not ready. Not for the burden of the wheel, not for the cold geometry of the highway. A doctor, Zuckerman, calls it a sickness, a yearning for the sting of the abyss. Eighteen, he says, too young. They crave the rush, the surge of adrenaline, the kiss of danger.\n\nThe tide is coming, a wave of young blood, the children of the boomers, eager and reckless.  They'll flood the roads, a storm of steel and flesh. Unchecked, the death toll will rise, a mountain in the desert of their lives.\n\nWe must act. No more licenses for the young.  Let them learn, let them study, let them feel the weight of the responsibility. Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen—let them wait. Let the wildness subside, let the hunger for death abate.\n\nThen, when they're ready, when the road whispers a promise instead of a threat, let them take the wheel. Until then, let them walk, let them learn, let them live.",
            "The Library of Congress, a repository of old things, held a collection of Edison’s flickering pictures. Fifteen of them, these trick films, from the time before the turn of the century. Illusions, they were, woven from the threads of edited moments.  \n\nI saw them, these ghosts of a forgotten age, and tried to make sense of their strange poetics. Most were bound to a stage, a proscenium arch framing their silent drama. The camera, a watchful eye, never moved. Long shots, medium shots, that was all. No close-ups, no intimacy. It was the theatre they mimicked, the vaudeville, the magic shows, where the whole was seen at once. The figures moved side-to-side, confined by the proscenium's confines.\n\nLike actors in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), they walked the stage, never coming closer, never receding.\n\nEach picture, a thought, a single idea captured. One shot, one film. A minute or less, fleeting as smoke. These were not stories, not in the way we understand them. They were tricks, fleeting moments of wonder, magic, a vanished hand, a sudden disappearance. \n\nBut look closer, at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). The head, severed, a phantom, a moment of illusion built from a joining of glimpses.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the soil, a farmer through and through, he was. Republicanism ran in his blood, a fire that burned bright in his belly. His life, bound to the earth, had forged him into a man of conviction, a voice raised in defense of freedom, against the creeping hand of government.  His creed, born of the fields, bled into every thought, every word he spoke. He saw the good in the land, in the sweat of man’s brow, and believed it the foundation of a just society.  \n\nHe saw in the young nation a chance to forge something new, unburdened by the ghosts of old. No king, no tradition to bind them. A government of the people, by the people, he believed, was the only true path.  He spoke of natural rights, of a balance delicate as a spider’s web, where the denial of one thread unravelled the whole. These rights, he said, must be kept from the grasp of power, for they were the lifeblood of a free man. He saw the state of nature, the brutal world before civilization, where strength ruled and the wicked prospered. But in this new world, he preached, there must be another way.\n\nTo build this ideal, he argued, government must be tempered by the very nature of man. Good and evil, he believed, were woven into the fabric of our being.  He saw government as a mirror, reflecting the virtues and vices of its creators. He spoke of  principles, the bedrock of a just society - the protection of property, the nurturing of the land, the restraint of unchecked greed. He believed that even the most flawed government, if built on these principles, could find some measure of fairness. For he knew, as a farmer knows the seasons, that self-interest was the engine of man. But it could be harnessed, turned to the common good, or it could lead to ruin, to a world where the strong devoured the weak.\n\nA strict construction, he demanded of the Constitution. A government limited, restrained, its power confined to the words written on the page. He feared the reach of a sprawling federal power, its cost breeding tyranny. But he knew that a literal reading, devoid of intent, could be a dangerous weapon in the hands of the ambitious.  He looked to the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution, as the true charter of the nation. It spoke of sovereign states, a union of equals, not a singular entity.",
            "The figures, they spoke of a fall. A steep one, in the third month.  December.  Snow falling on the New England ground, a shroud upon the campus. Fewer bicycles, fewer feet on the path. The semester's end, a flurry of papers and grades, a weight settling on the mind.  The log, it slipped from the frayed edges of their memory. The holidays, a long shadow stretching across the month, a time for leaving, for absence. January, the silence of a new year, the campus bare.  Then, a flicker. A spark, perhaps, in March. The Carpool Challenge, a last gasp of effort. A brief surge in the numbers. But the truth, it lingered like smoke in the air. The natural ebb and flow. The pull of the machine.\n\nThey say freedom lies in the wheel. It's a song woven into the fabric of this land. A siren song. To break free, you need a lure, a whisper of something more. Gifts, they offered. Small tokens, trinkets of comfort. Coffee, books, massages. A taste, a glimpse of something else. But what of a grander prize? A bicycle, gleaming in the sun. A machine that runs on air. A car that whispers of a different future. A promise of something more. Perhaps then, the numbers would rise, a testament to the changing tide.",
            "The thing they call an ETF. A packaged security. Designed to track some marker, some index, maybe a commodity or a whole basket of things. Like an index fund, but more nimble. Trades like stock on a board.\n\nIt offers the spread of the index fund, sure. But with the bite of a single share. You can short, you can go on margin, buy a single goddamn share. The fees though, they're leaner than a starving dog.  \n\nBut there's a cost. A commission each time you move. Like a toll on the road. \n\nAnd the variety, it's vast.

See if there's a better way to stack those stones, a tighter grip on the return, a lower tilt in the wind.\n\nWe ain't got time to measure every goddamn piece.  So we'll focus on the ten big ones. They hold most of the weight, 63.58% of the whole damn thing.\n\nWe'll see what these ten say about the IHF.  We'll calculate their beta, their return, how they move together.  See if they whisper the same song as the whole damn chorus.\n\nThe numbers tell a story. The top ten, they offer a return 6.11% higher. A goddamn sixteen percent jump. And their beta, it's a shade lower, a little more steady.\n\nBut is it enough?  Are these differences real, or just a whisper in the wind?  We gotta dig deeper, see if the data holds water.  We'll measure the standard deviation, the spread of those ten stocks. See if it matches up to the IHF.\n\nThe truth, it's out there somewhere.  We just gotta dig it up.",
            "Dream-Land. One of Poe's own words, he called it a good one. A poem where the word Thulé, it appears twice, like a shadow, in lines six and fifty-six. Mabbott, he says it comes from Virgil, an old man with a fancy for islands north of Britain. An island the Greeks thought was the edge of everything. Virgil, he used it, that much is sure. But there's another road, a more recent one, that some whisper about. Poe, he was drawn to the German tongue, to the dark whispers of their words. \n\nThis quote, it speaks of a familiarity, a knowing. Arndt, in his book about Poe and Goethe, he sees the marks of imitation, a reflection in the mirror. Two poems, two souls grappling with the same deep well of sorrow. \n\nOxford, they call it a Companion, this book of English Literature. Inside, it speaks of Goethe, a man who built his name on the play Faust, a story in two parts, the first a sigh in the year 1808, the second a death rattle in 1832. But within the second part, a smaller poem resides, a whisper called \"The King of Thulé\". A king, his queen gone, a goblet left behind. He drinks, he weeps, remembers. His grief, a tide that drowns him. He gives away his treasures, keeps only the goblet, a reminder of the light that's gone. He walks to the edge, the sea a dark maw below, throws the goblet in, closes his eyes, and lets go. \n\nThe King of Thulé, a shadow of Poe's own darkness. A reflection in the abyss. Faust, it took form on the stage in 1842, a year before Poe used Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". A year that echoed with the ghosts of loss. \n\nThulé, it appears twice in Poe's works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", he whispers \"ultma Thule\". But in \"Dream-Land\", it frames the poem, a bookend to a world consumed by sorrow. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\", twin poems, born from the same wellspring of despair. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\", he steps into Goethe's world, a world of darkness, of loneliness, of ghosts that haunt the edges of memory. A world where color fades, and only the echoes of loss remain. \n\nGoethe, a giant in the world of words, a name Poe would have known, even if it was only through the reverence he held for Tennyson. \n\nBut there were other paths, other ways to encounter Goethe's work. Reproductions, whispers carried on the wind, a world where his words found new homes.",
            "The law in California, it speaks of malice. A customer, she slips and falls on a mess of applesauce, a spilled offering in the maw of the grocery store. Could this court, might it see fit to award her not just for the hurt she’s suffered, but also for the sting of a punishment, a reckoning for the man who ran the store?\n\nA judge, he’s not likely to toss out the woman’s claim, not so easily. To win the right for such a punishment, she must show that the store manager’s actions were deliberate, a disregard for the hurt that might come. His heart, it must have been cold, knowing the danger, knowing what might befall another soul. She’ll say that he knew, the manager, that the slick floor was a threat.  Spills like this, they’d happened before, others had fallen.  He’d been warned twice, once by one man, then another. Yet he chose to eat his dinner while the danger lay in wait.\n\nBut the woman, she’ll have to argue harder still that the manager’s heart was truly black, that he was not just careless but cruel. Six times before in that year, folks had fallen, tripped, hurt themselves on the slick floors of his store.  He’d seen the danger, and he’d turned away.\n\nShe says it happened on a day in October, the thirteenth to be exact. A clock struck five, and a worker told the manager, this Paul Martin. Applesauce, he’d been told, a puddle in the aisle. “Dinner break,” the manager said, “no time for complaints.” Fifteen minutes passed, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, she warned him again. Same answer. By half past five, the woman, Jennifer Palmer, she slipped and fell. Her back, it was broken, her life forever changed.\n\n\nThe law in California, it speaks of malice. This manager, he knew the danger. Six times he’d been warned. Did he act with malice? Did he act with a heart that was cold?",
            "Four years gone now. A semester spent under the fluorescent hum of CBC's classrooms, wrestling with the question of Islam.  Hostile faith they called it.  A question whispered then, a question that now echoes louder than ever.  The world since the fall, a pendulum swing from fear to an almost suffocating acceptance. Could a man named Obama, with the ghost of his heritage clinging to him like a shroud, ever have worn the mantle of President back then?  \n\nThe Prophet's biography, a tangled thread of contradictions.  I'd heard the stories, the tales of conquest and forced conversion.  A sword at the throat, Islam the price of survival.  But this book, it painted a different picture.  A martyr misunderstood, a man humbled, seeking truth in the dust.  They say the people came to him, drawn by some unseen light.\n\nAnd there's a strange echo, a resonance between the ministries of these men, Jesus and Muhammad.  The multiplication of mutton and milk, a whispered miracle, a shared hunger.  A deliberate mirroring, perhaps, to elevate Muhammad, to cast him as a man of truth, a silent, unassuming force.  But it feels like a theft, a shadow play where one light steals the brilliance of another.\n\nThe stories, too, they feel manufactured, stacked like cards in a house of cards.  He heard from her, she heard from him, a whisper chain stretching back into the desert.  Proof, they say, of the truth's enduring power.  But the distance, the layers, they cast a shadow on the story itself, a whisper of doubt.\n\nThe biographer's intent, to lift Muhammad to a pedestal, to crown him with humility and wisdom.  But history, a stubborn thing, whispers a different tale.  Can those who follow him, those who claim his mantle, truly know the man behind the myth?",
            "The word of the man from Nazareth, his own teachings, they were cast aside like a worn cloak in the years after his passing.  Christianity, a river swollen by time, flowed on, ever changing its course.  The world, a restless beast, moved forward, a tide of progress washing over all.  The old ways clung to the shores, but their voices were faint, lost in the roar of the current.  A hunger will rise in the hearts of men, a yearning to sift through the layers of dogma, to find the man, the man beneath the monument.  It will take time, decades, perhaps centuries, but the tide will turn.  The river will run back up its course, seeking the source.\n\nThe doctrines, the pronouncements, they will fall away, one by one, like stones from a crumbling wall, until only the echo of his voice remains.  Across the land, in the halls of the church, the faithful will gather, their heads bowed, their ears open to the whisper of his words.  But the church, it will remain, a fortress of faith against the storm.  And though the river flows backward, the waters will run clear, the faith will find its unity.\n\nHistory is a wheel, turning ever onward, yet always returning to its center.  The Empire that once persecuted the followers of the Nazarene, it became the vessel of their faith.  The chains of slavery, they too fell, giving way to the rise of a new order.\n\nNow, the wheel turns once more, seeking the heart of the matter.  The differences, the factions, they will dissolve, leaving behind a single, clear image of the man, the man who walked the earth.  And in his words, not as pronouncements, but as whispers, as parables, the truth will be found.\n\nLook back, far back, to the time before the man.  Look to the people who walked the dusty roads of Judea.  They were a diverse people, divided by their own beliefs, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, all seeking the face of God.  Theirs was a faith, ancient and deep, a root from which the tree of Christianity would grow.",
            "The muck of it all. That's what Sinclair shows you. The hunger in men's bellies ain't just for food. It's for power, for more. The bosses, they're all the same. They build their empires of brick and steel, smoke billowing like a shroud against the sky. They see nothing but their own reflection in the glass towers, nothing of the grime clinging to the lives they grind beneath their wheels. \n\nHe paints a picture, stark and black, of the river of filth flowing from their factories, a sickness seeping into the ground, the air, the very bones of the city.  They don't care for the men who toil in the shadows, the men broken and bleeding in the name of progress. A dollar, that's all they see. A dollar and the endless churning of the machine, chewing up men and spitting them out like waste.\n\nSinclair speaks of a cauldron, seething with hate and jealousy.  Loyalty? Decency?  Lost in the stench of sweat and despair.  They'll lay you off with a flick of the wrist, no warning, no mercy. The law? A whisper in the wind.  The workers, they're slaves to a system built on their backs, their bodies broken, their dreams turned to dust.\n\nHe calls them slaves, and the word hangs heavy in the air.  Men trapped in a cage of their own making, their lives dictated by the whims of men who see them as nothing more than cogs in a machine. There's no escape, no light at the end of the tunnel. Just the endless grind, the gnawing hunger, and the crushing weight of a world that cares nothing for their souls.",
            "Some writers, they spin their words like a spider, weaving a web to catch the feelin' of a thing. They use tricks, these writers, some more cunning than others. Fitzgeral, he was a master of the trick. In his story, *The Great Gatsby*, he took words and slapped 'em together like mismatched puzzle pieces, makin' somethin' strange and new. He'd find a word, a color say, and give it a weight, a meaning that hung heavy in the air. Gold, green, white, red - these were his tools. He'd build a meaning around 'em, then use 'em to paint a picture, to make you feel somethin'. \n\nWhite and gray, these were his favorites. White, he made it mean somethin' clean, fancy, like a rich man's linen shirt. Gray, that was older, faded, like a memory lost in the dust. He planted these seeds early, all through the book. Everyone was wearin' white, like ghosts in a summer haze. Daisy, Jordan, Nick - all swathed in white. Even the way he talks about the parties, it's all white and dull, like a bleached bone.\n\nThen there's gray. The names, the cars, the land - all swallowed up by the grayness. Like the world itself was turnin' to ash. He took these colors, white and gray, and used them to show you somethin' about the people, about what they were really worth. Daisy, she becomes a ghost in white, a shell of a woman, floatin' through the story like a wisp of smoke.  \n\nFitzgerald, he knew how to use a color like a weapon. He'd paint a picture, and you'd feel it in your bones. That's the power of his words, the power of his vision.",
            "The San Diego sun beats down on a land fat with bounty. Tomatoes ripe for the picking, citrus heavy on the branches, greens unfolding like emerald hands. Squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers – all flourish in this Eden of plenty. A hunger for the pure and the simple has taken hold, a demand for what grows from the earth unburdened. The people line up, lists in hand, yearning for the bounty of the organic harvest. Eggs, milk, the cream of the land, all free from the taint of artifice.\n\nThese same farms, they open their gates, inviting the curious in. Hikers tread paths between rows, their eyes drawn to the flitting wings of birds, the whisper of the wind through the leaves. A lesson learned, a connection forged, the land yielding its secrets. This, then, is the promise – to till the soil with care, to reap the rewards, and to offer a glimpse of the wild heart of the world.\n\nThe earth remembers. It yearns for balance.  Chemical poisons have poisoned the soil, choked the life from the land.  Organic farming, it whispers, a return to the ancient ways.  But it demands a different kind of labor, a patient hand, a constant vigilance.  To nurture the soil, to coax life from the earth, it requires sweat and toil. Losses are heavier, harvests smaller.\n\nThe path is not paved with gold, but with grit and determination. Planting cover crops, grazing with purpose, battling the encroaching weeds, it all takes its toll.  Yet the rewards are greater than mere profit. The land sings a song of abundance, a symphony of life.  A haven for the endangered, a refuge for the weary, a testament to the enduring spirit of the wild.\n\nThe land itself, it tells a story.  Cracked earth, chaparral clinging to life, a whisper of oak trees stretching towards the sky. A hundred species, some teetering on the edge, others rebuilding their lost dominion. The kangaroo rat, a phantom fleeting through the brush, the yellow-legged frog, a splash of color in a sun-baked pool. The gnatcatcher, a song on the wind, a reminder that even in this hardened land, beauty persists. \n\nThis land has seen the hand of man, the tread of cattle, the ghosts of homesteaders long gone. Now, a new chapter begins, a promise whispered on the breeze. To heal the earth, to honor the past, to build a future where man and nature walk side by side.",
            "Culture. A word worn thin by use. It ain't no thing you can hold in your hand. More like a shadow, stretching long and thin, defining the space a man moves in. It's what ain't there that matters as much as what is.  \n\nTo say all Russians are stubborn is to miss the point.  Like saying all deserts are sand. Sure, there's sand. But there's wind too. And heat. And secrets buried deep.\n\nUnderstandin' a culture ain't about boxes and labels. It's about the dirt beneath your boots, the language on your tongue, the ghosts that whisper in your ear.\n\nWhen you walk into a room, you see it through the lens of your own past. Comparisons rise up like smoke. But tryin' to change a culture is like tryin' to dam the river. It'll find a way around.\n\nBest to respect the currents. Learn the flow.  See the world through their eyes. Even when you're on shaky ground, a little respect can go a long way.\n\nAnd culture ain't just about borders. It's the walls inside a company too. Some places run on long hours and deadlines. Others on whispers and coffee breaks.  It's in the clothes they wear, the words they use, the way they treat each other.\n\nValues. Now those are the heart of a culture. What they hold dear. What they fear. \n\nIf a man's gotta save face, he ain't gonna stab his boss in the back to win a deal. And if a woman's gotta drive a hard bargain, she ain't gonna back down easy.\n\nKnow your enemy. Know their values. Know yourself. That's the key to any deal worth closin'.",
            "The fool has said it, in the dark corners of his heart: \"There is no God.\" These words, carved from the psalm stones of the Book, mark the opening of Anselm's inquiry. He seeks to prove the Lord, the God of the scriptures, a God bound by the pages of belief. Aquinas, another traveler on this path, holds the same conviction. But the question hangs heavy: whose argument rings truest? To answer that, we must first accept the premise, for the sake of this reckoning, that both these men believe in the same God, the God of the Bible. To wander from that path, to consider other gods, would be to stray from the heart of their discourse.\n\nYet, while both men grapple with the weight of the question, neither, I would argue, lays bare a foundation strong enough to stand against the winds of doubt.\n\nAnselm's journey begins within. He seeks the proof of God not in the rustle of leaves or the crash of waves, but in the chambers of the soul. His God is a truth, a concept, bound by the very act of understanding.  He posits that to conceive of God's absence is to fail to grasp the very nature of existence itself. His logic is a tangled web of faith, where the unseen is made known through the lens of the mind.  Anselm tells us to look inward, to find the Lord etched upon the tablets of our own being.\n\nAquinas, however, seeks a different kind of proof. He lays down five pillars of logic, each one a sturdy argument for the existence of God. Change, he argues, points to a mover. Causation demands a first cause. Contingency whispers of a necessary being. Degrees of excellence point to a supreme being. And harmony, the intricate dance of the cosmos, speaks of a divine architect.  He offers a God not of faith but of reason, a God that can be known through the cold, hard light of logic.\n\nBoth men grapple with the darkness, seeking the spark of divinity. But neither, in the end, offers a path free of shadows.",
            "In the time of shadows, a prince was born.  A prince who would be known as Buddha. He turned from the world, sought the silence, found the light. His words, they spread like wildfire, birthing a faith. A faith called Buddhism, its oldest form called Theravada.  Two and a half thousand years have passed since then.  The world has changed. Buddhism too. Even in Sri Lanka, a land where the faith took root deep, things are not as they were.  They hold ceremonies there, cutting the water, a dance of belief. Monks and layfolk join hands, whispering prayers. Buddha spoke not of this ritual, yet it persists.  The changes creep in, from the simple trappings to the heart of the matter. The Theravada people, both those who live in the temples and those who walk among men, they have had to shift, to adjust. The reasons are many, some born of darkness, some of light.\n\nCertain words will be heard often in this telling. Internal force, external force. Internal, the hand of those who follow the Buddha's path, whether cloaked in robes or not. External, the touch of those who dwell outside the faith. A hostile force seeks to wound, to tear down. A benign force, it matters not if harm comes or good, it stands apart.  \n\nFirst, we must look at the bedrock of belief, the core of Theravada.  The refuge is taken in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma is the ancient words, the Tripitaka, three baskets of wisdom.  The Sutta Pitaka holds the Buddha's words, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the nature of things. Anatta, no soul. Dukkha, the pain that is life. Anicca, the ever-changing world. Only by seeing these truths can one escape Sansara, the wheel of birth and death. Along with Sansara, desire and hatred and delusion will fade, leaving only enlightenment.  The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the rules of conduct. For the layfolk, five precepts:  no killing, no lying, no stealing, no wrong conduct, no intoxication. For the monks, a heavier burden, a stricter path. But at the heart of it all lies the four noble truths.  First, Dukkha: life is suffering. Second, attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The American nation and Mexico. Two countries bound by a blood-soaked history, a feud stretching back fifty-seven years, from eighteen thirty-six to eighteen ninety-three.  (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The high tide of that enmity crested in the Mexican-American War, a brutal reckoning between eighteen forty-six and eighteen forty-eight. The Americans, hungry for land, swallowed Mexico whole, claiming Texas and the Southwest as their own.  Before the guns fell silent on the Great War, there were skirmishes, standoffs, echoes of that ancient hatred.\n\nIt began with a clashing of cultures, a contest of faith and tradition.  Religion, language, ways of life – all a source of friction.  And beneath it all, the cold, hard truth of material interests. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nSuch is the way of nations, bound by proximity, their fates entwined.  Borders become lines in the sand, marking not just territory but the boundaries of their desires, their fears.  The United States and Mexico, two countries tethered by blood and bone, are but one example in a long litany of border disputes.  David M. Pletcher (1977)  speaks of a \"long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problem\" in Mexico and Cuba. (p. 41) A problem born of proximity, of a shared history stained with conflict. While others in Latin America found solace in the American embrace, Mexico and Cuba remained forever marked by that ancient animosity.\n\nReligion, a furnace of division, a tinderbox waiting for a spark.  Sally Frahm (2001) writes, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" (p. 86) \n\nLike the Cold War, the struggle between the United States and Mexico was a dance of ideologies, a contest of wills. But here, the battleground was faith, not political systems.  A legacy of distrust, inherited from the Spanish and the English, lingered like a curse, poisoning the well of good faith.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalog seventeen disputes between these two nations.  Most, territorial skirmishes, raids across the border, and the constant struggle to contain the violence that festered along the frontier.  Banditry, lawlessness, a constant shadow cast by the specter of violence. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nAnd then, a shift. As Mexico's fate became inextricably linked to the American economy, the rivalry cooled, its intensity abated.  (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109).  American ambition shifted from territorial conquest to economic dominion, a slow, insidious tightening of the grip. (p. 110)  By the century's end, the old feud had waned, replaced by a new, more subtle form of control.",
            "Fifteen years gone. A sudden sickness, a thief in the night. Took hold, stole my strength. Never saw it coming.  Nurse I was then.  A choice made, a cage of duty.  \"Always work,\" they said. \"They'll always be sick.\"  A mantra whispered in my ear, a gilded promise. Science and words beckoned, but security, that was the siren song. The safety of helping others, a shield against the ghosts of my own childhood.\n\nBut the ground shifted. Forty-six years old.  Alone. Empty pockets.  The sickness, a shackle on my body. Fifteen years of Social Security, a meager pittance.  Nothing left.  Just the daily struggle. A gnawing hunger, not just for food, but for something more.  \n\nThere's a truth in the wreckage. Couldn't have survived this long without them.  Family. Friends.  A lifeline thrown in the face of the storm.   They held me up when the world spun dark. And believe me, when the real darkness comes, you find yourself small, insignificant, helpless.\n\nLife, it throws its punches.  Big ones.  Little ones.  No matter the armor you wear, some blows are too heavy to bear alone.\n\nThey talk of rugged individualism.  Of leaning on yourself. But look back. What sustained our fathers?  Not grit alone. It was kindness, a hand reaching out, a shared burden. The wagon trains, the pioneers, they crossed the land together.  They understood the strength in unity.\n\nSo yes, be ready. Have your supplies, your shelter, your plans.  I do.  The canned goods, the water filters, the tools.  But don't forget the other things.  The human connection.  Reach out your hand.  Ask for help. Offer it.  Build a community.  That's the real strength.",
            "The question of form, of how life takes the shape it does, has haunted man since he first looked upon the world. Why do creatures take the forms they do? Are there unseen hands guiding their evolution, some force shaping the course of change? Even now, a century after Thompson's lament that the zoologist could scarce dream of defining organic forms in numbers, the mystery remains. \n\nYet, men have sought to chart this course, to find the equations that govern the dance of life. They've used the language of mathematics to trace the growth of mollusks, the unfolding of their shells through time and space. Our own work seeks to unravel this mystery in the case of Prunum, these spiral-shelled creatures of the deep. We've taken to X-rays, peering into their silent forms, measuring, quantifying the curves and contours of their shells. These numbers then feed a machine, a digital forge called CerioShell, where hypothetical forms are born, possibilities explored. \n\nThe shell, itself, is a marvel. A tube winding through time, through 360 degrees of space. Each twist, each coil, a whorl, spiraling around an unseen axis, the columella. The speed of its growth, the size of its aperture, all tell a story, a silent chronicle of life's journey.  \n\nWe look at these shells from all sides, apical, basal, apertural, abapertural, seeking to understand the language of their form. We count the whorls, each a chapter in their history, and trace the path of the aperture, the mouth of the creature, as it moves through time and space.  \n\nIf we can understand this path, this trajectory, then perhaps we can begin to unravel the secrets of evolution, the forces that shape life's grand design.",
            "The death of babes in the cradle, the passing of infants, it clung to Indonesia like a shroud. For a decade, the toll remained a constant shadow.  The country, they said, was striving for the sun, chasing the Millennium's promises of water and clean living. Yet the health of mothers and children, that remained in the dark. Progress was a whisper, a sigh against the wind. The reasons, they would say, were many. A web of shortcomings, a call for a stronger hand to guide the whole of the health system, not just singular threads of intervention.\n\nThey spoke of births attended by hands skilled in the ways of healing. Seventy-two percent, they claimed, a number that rang hollow. For what use are midwives' touch when storms of complications rage? Hemorrhage, a silent thief, stole mothers in the night. A fragile facade of progress, a mirage in the desert. And the children, they suffered too. Diarrheal fever, a scourge, claimed its victims with a chilling frequency, left untended by the healing hands. Postnatal care, a whispered prayer, unanswered in too many corners.\n\nCesarean births, a scar on the flesh, were rare. Four percent, a meager offering. The shadows of inequity stretched long. In cities, the steel-eyed surgeon's hand was common. In the villages, a shadow lingered, a mere two percent. Access, a privilege, a gulf between the haves and the have-nots.  The poor, burdened by the weight of cost, were left adrift on a sea of despair.\n\nWhat then, the question lingered, how to mend the broken threads? Should they weave a tapestry of targeted programs, or strengthen the loom that held the whole fabric of health? The allure of the singular thread was strong. A quicker fix, a more manageable knot. But beware the pitfalls. For the weight of one program, one intervention, could pull down the threads of others. The shadow of funding, a fickle beast, would consume all, leaving other areas starved. And the endless duplication, a maddening labyrinth of forms and whispers, would choke the life out of the system.",
            "Victorian fictions, they swarm with detail, fixated on the powdered wigs and silks of a dying age. Yet some, like *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, they turn away from the gilded cage. These tales spin a thread of mystery, a touch of the uncanny, a deviation from the expected, sharpening the edges of their characters, laying bare the gnawing hunger that drives them, the shadows that dance in their hearts. \n\n*He was caught in a maelstrom of thoughts, a howling wilderness in his mind. The voices of Sikes and Crackit, their words like stones thrown against a skull, echoed in the chambers of his soul. He was both witness and participant, caught in a tangled web of their malice. Then, a sudden crack, a flash of light, a roar that split the night. A tumult of cries and shouts, a kaleidoscope of flickering flames, and he, a puppet in unseen hands, was dragged away. Through it all, a dull ache, a persistent throb of pain, a gnawing fear that clenched at his insides.*\n\nThese tales weave their mysteries in dreams, in visions that bleed into waking hours. In *Oliver Twist*, these phantasmagorias dig into the boy's soul, revealing the festering wounds, the terror that festers beneath the surface. When the bullet finds its mark, when Oliver is reborn in the crucible of death, he relives it all in a haze of fragmented memories, a nightmare he cannot escape. The passage speaks of helplessness, a soul adrift in a sea of pain. His senses are numbed, the world a blur of color and sound. He is a leaf tossed by the wind, carried away by forces beyond his control.\n\nThe shooting, it is not just a wound, it's a reflection of his powerlessness. He cannot fight, cannot even try to fight. His despair is palpable, a heavy shroud woven by Fagin's grim hand. It is a surrender, a slow acceptance of fate, a resignation to the cruel whims of a world that offers no solace. \n\n*The day bled into the night, a fleeting shadow against the canvas of eternity. There was no day, only the endless expanse of night, a suffocating silence broken only by the whisper of the wind.*",
            "A couple of years back I was workin' in one of them after-school programs, tutorin' the young'uns. Elementary kids, mostly. Tried to lend a hand wherever they needed it, but English and readin' was my strong suit. \n\nOld man Johnson, the program director, he pulled me aside one day. Said there was this boy, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, stuggledin' somethin' fierce with readin'. Seems to me somethin' were off. He'd pronounce some letters clean as a whistle, others like they were foreign tongue. Strange, real strange. Little fella was Latino, that much I knew, though he talked English like a born speaker.\n\nWe battled with it, day after day, till the day his mama walked in. I was mindin' a handful of strays while the rest of the kids were gone on some field trip, when she came in. Didn't speak a lick of English, her. Just Spanish. My Spanish was shakier than a newborn colt, just learnin' myself, but we managed a sort of conversation. And then it hit me, like a stray bullet,  Adrian weren't readin' wrong, he just didn't know the damn alphabet. Didn't know it like the back of his hand. \n\nDon't know if that ever did him much good, but I hope he's doin' alright.\n\nSee, I tell this story 'cause it's about the language barrier, the wall that stands in the way in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as clear cut as you think. Even a kid who speaks English like a songbird, readin' can be a hard climb. \n\nWe all agree this problem exists, right? So what the hell do we do? In Adrian's case, it was simple enough: a tutor, a good eye on the alphabet, how to sound out the words. But for kids who barely speak English at all, it's a different beast altogether. No easy answers there. Dual language programs, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of it's a magic bullet. It takes all of it, mixed together, like a good stew.\n\nFirst off, dual language programs ain't just for kids whose first tongue is Spanish. It's for everybody. Studies say kids in these programs, they learn better, faster. A lot of folks scared of those programs, thinkin' they waste money, that most kids won't get nothin' outta it. But that's a lie. If we made these programs the rule, not the exception, every kid would benefit.\n\nHow do we do it? Make every teacher bilingual? Now that's a tall order, ain't it? Unrealistic, maybe. But we can have assistants, tutors, call 'em what you will, folks who speak both languages.",
            "From the time a man first draws breath, the word is whispered: there's something out there. Bigger. Beyond knowing. Some are taught in houses of worship, some seek answers in the hush of their own souls. Many take the creed of their fathers, a worn map passed down through generations. But some, born defiant, deny the shadows, clinging tight to the small sphere of their own making.  They build their own shrines, their own gods, only to find them crumbling in the dust. We all walk a path, carving our own hollows in the endless night, searching for a flicker, a spark in the dark to guide us.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, smoke curling from his lips, the air thick with rain. We sat on the porch, the tin roof a drum against the storm. The gutters funneled water, drowning the brittle weeds at the edge. He looked out, eyes distant, lost in the drumming gray. Skin stretched thin over bone, his clothes hanging loose on a frame grown frail. Hair, once thick, now a sparse dusting on his head. He didn't meet my gaze. I felt the cold tug at my chest, a fear that choked the words. How could I speak of the chasm opening before us, of the inevitability of his passing?  So I held him, felt the tremor in his hand, and sat beside him, sharing the unsettling silence, the rain a constant, steady beat against the twilight.\n\nHe died in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The poisons they used, they kept him from the dirt a few months longer, but at what cost? The question hung in the air, unanswered, a bitter taste on my tongue. What god, I thought, would let this happen?  Alone in the darkness, I didn't pray. If he existed, he'd stopped listening long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to watch him go. The man who'd shaped me, the lifeblood of my being, fading into the void. I chose to remember him as he was, not as he'd become. I knew him better than anyone, better than his own blood. I knew he wouldn't want me there, a witness to his final breaths. So I curled in my bed for days, waiting for the news, the phone silent, a hollow space where his voice should have been.",
            "The Gothic, Watt calls it an oxymoron, \"Old-New.\" A contradiction in terms. Praised and damned, lauded for its terrible sublime, accused of being hollow.  Walpole, in his Castle of Otranto, the first of its kind, wove together the threads of ancient and modern romances. A new tapestry of words, stitched with echoes of the old theatricality, the raw mimicry of nature found in those newer, humbler tales. An \"old\" story, he called it, a Gothic Story.\n\nThe word itself, \"Gothic,\" a relic, a whisper from a time long past. Used to mark tribes and styles and ages, always cast as archaic, a shadow in the face of progress. Yet, in its shadow, a new light flickered.  The novel, a format still fresh, allowed the reader a glimpse into the mind, a close communion with the soul of the characters. This paradox, the ancient and the new, bound together in the Gothic, this is its enduring power. It remains both a fossil and a bloom, strange and familiar to those who read it centuries hence.\n\nChivalry, a ghost from the medieval halls, lingers in these stories. The training of a knight, the ideal of honor and courage, a reflection perhaps of what the writers saw lacking in their own time. Walpole, caught in the maelstrom of politics, facing whispers and accusations, may have yearned for that lost virtue. He saw it in the past, idealized and romanticized, a beacon in the darkness.\n\nFrederic, a character in the Castle, stands as a testament.  He is described, a prince, a figure of tragedy, marked by suffering and loss. The image is grand, a knight in shining armor, though exaggerated, a hint of the excess to come. Yet, even in the shadow of the impossible, there is a truth, a yearning for a world where honor still held sway.",
            "The flow of things. From want to want.  Goods snaking through the dark, a chain of bones, starting with the desire in the customer's eye. It winds back, a tendril of need, to raw material, to the forge, the factory floor, the rumble of trucks, and back again to the waiting hands. This chain, they call it \"Supply Chain Management\". A word coined in the year 1982 by a man named Oliver, a shepherd of commerce. He spoke of planning, of moving the pieces, of control, all to sate the insatiable appetite of the consumer. Six things, he said, are the hinges on which this chain swings: production, supply, the hoarding of stock, the choosing of place, the conveyance of goods, and the whispering of information.  \n\nProduction. The heart of the beast. It is here the blueprints are laid, the when, the why, the where, the how. The manager, a cartographer of need, must chart the desires of the market, the shifting sands of want. For what is produced must be what is craved.  He digs deep into the belly of the beast, seeking the pulse of demand.  What will sell? How much? Where will it be forged, in what crucible of steel and toil?  This is the manager's burden. He must weigh the cost, the time, the quality, all against the fickle whims of the customer.\n\nThen comes the dance of supply, the intricate weaving of partnerships, the choosing of allies. Different divisions, each with their own skills, their own tools, their own sweat.  The manager, a conductor of this orchestra, must decide where each piece will play.  Sometimes, the work is outsourced, a delegation of labor to strangers, a gamble on speed and cost.  Velocity, they call it, the ability to dance faster, cheaper, better.",
            "The sign hung crooked in the dust, a stark black square against the sunbaked air. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it read, scrawled in the hurried hand of a woman with eyes that looked too old for her face. Ellen Page. Juno. She stood alone, a lone figure amidst the city's clamor, a whisper in the wind. \n\nBurma. A name that tasted of dust and decay. A country swallowed by shadows, ruled by men with iron in their souls and shadows in their hearts. \n\nThey came to power in a night of blood, a coup that cleaved the nation in two. Monks, robed in saffron, had dared to rise, their voices a fragile tremor against the junta's iron fist. A revolution of saffron, they called it. But the silence was soon broken by the crackle of gunfire, the screams swallowed by the dust. Monasteries, once sanctuaries, lay in ruins, their sacred silence shattered by the thunder of tanks.\n\nThe world turned its eyes away. A photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, caught in the crossfire, his camera shutter forever silent. A thousand silent screams, buried beneath the weight of a government's lies. \n\nThis, however, is not new. The hunger for power, the thirst to crush dissent, it is a serpent that coils within the heart of man. From Caesar's Rome to the gilded cages of emperors, the story repeats. \n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity drowned in a tide of bullets. The ghosts of a thousand fallen souls whispering in the wind. Rwanda, a butcher's field, where the blood of innocents stained the earth crimson.  And the Third Reich, a nightmare painted in ash and the stench of death. \n\nThe cycle spins. The serpent coils. And the world watches, a silent witness to the horrors that unfold.",
            "The man, Ellington, he left his mark on that jazz music, a long shadow cast by years of work and a hand that knew how to coax the best from his men. The piano, it ain't always the star in his music, but as a composer, he built worlds, intricate and dark, where each man could sing his own song. He'd lay down the bones of a tune, a framework for improvisation, then build up around it, weaving in threads of brass and reed, each note chosen to fit the soul of the player. His sound, it was his own, a tapestry woven from the individual voices, a symphony of grit and grace.  \n\nThe Grove folks, they called him innovative. They talked about \"Creole Love Call\" and the way he used that voice, not for words, but for texture, for color. Like a new instrument, the voice bled into the music, a moan or a cry, adding depth to the blues. He knew how to lift his men, how to make their talents shine. That piece, \"Creole Love Call,\" it was a slow burn, twelve bars of soul, six choruses unfolding like a story.  \n\nFirst, a call and response between voice and woodwinds, the voice smooth at first, then rough, like a wound opening up. Then the trumpet, muted, whispering a mournful melody, stretching out those blue notes. The clarinet, it took flight, a sweet and soaring solo, backed by a piano that tickled the edges. Then the whole band, echoing the first chorus, a conversation between brass and reeds. And the fifth, that was the climax, the reeds rising, their voices ragged and raw, backed by a stop-time rhythm that pulsed like a heartbeat. Back to the beginning for the last chorus, the voice now a growl, an instrument of pain and power. A final tag, a vocal run, a trombone crying out in dissonance, and it was over.\n\nThat was Ellington, a master of sound, a weaver of dreams. He took what was simple and made it complex, he took the ordinary and turned it into something beautiful and strange. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he laid it all down, the tight orchestration, the ear for tone color. A muted trumpet, a scat singer, their voices blending into one, a conversation between instruments and words. And in \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" he used Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, his trombone, to sing the melody, a mournful cry that echoed through the night.",
            "The need had been a gnawing in her belly since she was fourteen, a hunger that no earthly thing could sate. It had bloomed with the first blush of womanhood, a strange ache that tightened with each passing year. Three years on, at seventeen, she'd come to understand it wasn't for things she yearned, but for someone. A companion. Yet no boy had ever stirred the slumbering fire within. Some had tried, clumsy and awkward in their pursuit of the unyielding, but none had come close. She wracked her brain, trying to decipher the riddle of her own heart. What strange alchemy could brew such a thing in a girl on the cusp of womanhood? Theories had bloomed and withered like desert flowers, leaving her thirsty still.  \n\nDays at home were usually quiet. Her parents were good folk, rooted in the earth, their lives a gentle hum of routine. They rarely raised their voices, and their arguments with her were as rare as locusts in a drought. The only discord came when she chafed against their stillness, her own spirit a whirlwind of restless energy. She was the daughter of calm, but a storm in her own right, her laughter and light a beacon in their quiet world.\n\nBut this day hung heavy, the air thick with an unspoken tension. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration in the mundane, a sharp cry sliced through the quiet. Her mother's voice, a melody broken and strained. She flew to the kitchen, fear a bitter taste on her tongue. \"Mother?\" she breathed, her voice a desperate plea.\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, a crumpled figure amidst the scattered clutter. A whimper escaped her lips, a strangled \"Ow\" that spoke of agony.\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\nShe knelt beside her, her hand reaching out, trembling. \"What is it? What happened?\"\n\nPain contorted her mother's features. \"Sweet... take me... to the hospital.\"\n\nHer words were shards of broken glass, her voice a whisper on the wind.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nHer mother's hand, clammy and cold, pointed towards the back door.\n\nShe knew then, a surge of fierce determination welling within her, that her mother needed her. That the calm she had known was shattered, and only she could hold it together.\n\nShe had spent her youth training, honing her strength, driven by a need she hadn't understood. Now, that need found its purpose. Lifting her mother, she felt the weight of her body, a burden she wouldn't shirk. She carried her to the car, her muscles burning, her breath ragged.\n\nThe hospital, a sterile landscape of pain and fear, swallowed them whole. The scent of disinfectant and sickness hung heavy in the air, but her mind was a single, unwavering point: her mother.\n\nShe pushed through the throngs of worried faces, her voice a command. \"Help! Help my mother!\"\n\nA rolling bed materialized, a lifeline in the sea of despair. They rushed her mother away, leaving her alone, her heart a drumbeat against her ribs, fear a cold hand gripping her throat.\n\nThey had told her it was a fall. A simple fall from a stepladder, reaching for a vase placed too high. But she knew, deep in her bones, that it was more than that. A broken vase was a small thing, a symbol of a larger fracture, a crack in the fabric of their world.",
            "The study sought to lay bare the link between a way of eating they called the “Mediterranean Diet” —  or aMed,  a stricter measure — and the harsh realities of heart disease and stroke.  The aMed, it was claimed, meant to favor the bounty of the earth: plants in all their forms, nuts and grains, fish swimming in the sea, and oils pressed from olives.  It shunned the flesh of animals and the fat that clung to them, save for a measured sip of wine.\n\nBefore, whispers had circulated about this diet and its power.  Some said it kept the heart strong, others that it lengthened the years.  But these stories lacked focus, failing to pinpoint the threat of stroke and its cold, silent hand.\n\nThis study, a long watch over a cohort of 74,886 women, their years stretching from 38 to 63, sought to shed light on these shadows.  These women, nurses tending to the sick, had been followed for two decades, their habits chronicled in questionnaires that asked them to recall what had nourished their bodies.  More than ninety-five percent remained steadfast in their duty, their stories woven into the fabric of the study.\n\nEach year, they were questioned, their tales of what they ate analyzed and weighed against the stark records of illness.  Heart attacks, strokes, their grim pronouncements, were confirmed by the cold hand of medical records or the finality of death certificates.  Where records were lost, the whispers persisted, their stories deemed \"probable\" but still woven into the tapestry.\n\nThe researchers, meticulous and watchful, accounted for every factor that could cloud their vision: age, the habit of smoking, the weight they bore, the changes that came with menopause, and the treatments they sought.\n\nAt last, they turned their gaze to the aMed score, a measure of adherence to the way of eating, and its link to the grim outcomes.  They found that the women who best embraced the aMed, who walked in step with its rhythms, were less vulnerable to the heart's betrayals and the sudden darkness of stroke.\n\nOver two decades, the toll was tallied:  2391 heart attacks, 1763 strokes, and 1077 lives extinguished by these silent killers.  The women at the crest of the aMed ladder, those who walked most closely with its wisdom, were shielded from these fates.  Their risk was diminished, a testament to the power of the food that nourished them.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, a house built on sand, began to crack. The specter of unemployment stretched long and lean across the land. Houses, once symbols of promise, stood empty, monuments to a broken system. Corporations, giants of industry, toppled like dominoes, their foundations rotted by greed. This sickness, this recession, it lingers still, a shadow across the nation's soul. How did it come to this? How did the heart of the nation beat so erratically, its pulse faltering? The answer lies in the halls of power, in the decisions made by men more interested in personal gain than the common good.\n\nBanks, pressured by unseen hands,  lent freely to the undeserving, handing out sub-prime loans like cheap whiskey. These loans, like poisoned fruit, corrupted the very fabric of the financial world. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, once pillars of stability, were twisted into instruments of this decay. They churned these toxic mortgages into complex securities, packaging them like so much illicit cargo, peddling them to unsuspecting investors. When the music stopped, the borrowers defaulted, leaving banks shorn of their capital, their balance sheets bleeding, and the contagion spreading like wildfire through the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this catastrophe were sown long ago, in the twilight of the Clinton years. In the pursuit of a second term, the President sought to manipulate the levers of power, to bolster his popularity with promises of easy credit. The lending restrictions, once safeguards against ruin, were relaxed. The stage was set, the drama unfolding, a tragedy in slow motion.\n\nHolmes, a scribe from the New York Times, saw the storm brewing. He wrote in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" He warned, his words echoing with prescience, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nThe complexity of the financial instruments themselves, these intricate mortgages and repackaged debts, only deepened the mire. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations – their names whispered with dread – entangled the nation's financial system in a web of interdependency.\n\nAnd then came the crash. The housing bubble, inflated to monstrous proportions, burst with a deafening roar. The financial institutions, their portfolios filled with toxic assets, were left reeling. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers crumbled into dust, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, once titans of Wall Street, were forced to beg for government scraps. Fannie and Freddie, their balance sheets crippled by mortgage debt, were brought under the iron fist of the state.",
            "Exposition. A word that hangs in the air like smoke from a dying fire. A place in the story where the writer might try to take flight, to soar with words that shine like burnished steel. Or it might be the place where the reader's eyes glaze over, where the mind wanders to more pleasant fields. Dr. Merlin, she's been known to let out a bellow when she's lost in the thicket of Too Much Telling. Not the pleasant kind of bellow, mind you.\n\nTruth is, exposition ain't your friend.\n\nYou know the old saying: show, don't tell. But even a seasoned hand like Dr. Merlin can get caught in the trap of long stretches of words that ain't leading nowhere. It's that little devil on the writer's shoulder, whispering to get the history out of the way, to get to the good parts. Not the other devil, of course, the one that insists on telling you the childhood woes of every last character.\n\nExposition, it's the blunt instrument of storytelling.  Telling the reader what happened, in plain, unembellished prose.  Like a sailor reciting the tale of a long voyage, dumping a whole sea of words on a captive audience. In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nTake a story, for instance. You're told the heroine met her love in a certain place, at a certain time. They married, grandly, and then her husband, he was murdered right before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this whole saga to stretch out over two pages, with the couple only uttering a few words between them. You'd expect the author to linger on the husband, to show you his heart through his words, through his manner. You'd see the way his presence filled the heroine's world, how she blossomed under his gaze. If the story later tells you this was the case, you'd want to see it, to feel it, not just be told.  A well-drawn husband, he'd draw you in, make you feel the weight of his loss, and in that loss, you'd feel the heroine's pain more deeply.\n\nYou see, good writing, it gives you the meat on the bone. It takes that simple story, the \"They met, they married, he died,\" and it fleshes it out, makes it real.\n\n\nSometimes, it's tempting to rush past things.  A new character, maybe.  He was in the Air Force, now he runs a gas station at night.  Twice married, no kids.  Likes to fish on Sundays. Dreams of owning the place someday.  Had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.  \n\nBut the writer, she has to slow down.  She has to let the reader see those things, not just hear them.",
            "The flicker in the box showed two stories from Columbus, Ohio. First, NBC 4, live this morning, August 13th, 2011. A man in Ashley, Ohio, had taken a knife to his wife. They didn't name her, but his name was Shad Hostettler. His picture, a mug shot, stared back, all hard angles and shadowed eyes. The kind of face that might hold the devil's own secrets. Two minutes they gave the story, all they could spare, before moving on. He'd stabbed her, they said, multiple times. Arrested. A quick account of a killing, swift and brutal. \n\nNext, a young man, Travis Buyers, eighteen. Shot in the Sharon Woods, early morning. Critically injured, they said. No arrests, no suspects. The SWAT team, like ghosts in the fog, picking at the pieces. This one felt shorter, swallowed down. A black man, shot in a black neighborhood. A truth you see if you know where to look. The media, they feast on white pain. A missing child, a white woman in distress, and the airwaves crackle with their plight. But a black man, a black life, it gets a whisper, a glance, if that. \n\nA hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, the next story. A .22, they said, from a rifle. Fired from somewhere in the dusk. Five thousand dollars, Crime-Stoppers offered, for information leading to the shooter.\n\nRain and thunderstorms, the forecast. Mid-eighties, they said, the weekend a swelter. Short, they made it, a tease for the anxious eye. \n\nThen, a robbery, a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, they said, wearing a hoodie. Six feet tall, one hundred and fifty pounds. They lingered on the details, the darkness of his skin, like it was the defining truth.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a drug kingpin from Texas, caught in the net.  Conspiracy to distribute marijuana, they said, a flood of green from Texas to Ohio. Twenty-five years, they said, a harsh sentence.  Or 300 months, a colder, more deliberate way of saying it. And a Hispanic man, a detail that felt out of place, a whisper of a prejudice.",
            "The blood bond. A hard knot that ties men together, raw and unforgiving. It holds within it the dark heart of things: love, yes, but also the bitter tang of envy, the sting of cruelty. Brothers, they see each other like no other. Not as the world sees them, but as they truly are, a reflection staring back from a well of shared bone and blood. And it is in the stark light of extremity, when the world cracks open, that this bond reveals its true nature, for good or ill.\n\nThis knowing, this seeing, it comes with a price.  The consequences bloom like a poison flower, twisting around the roots of every thought, every action.  In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys, brothers bound by this terrible thing, walk a path of thorns.  The world they move through is thick, lush, alive, a green shroud hiding the rot beneath. They set out on a journey, a fool's errand, driven by the ache of pride and the gnawing sense of something broken. In the end, only one will walk away.\n\nThe story unfolds in the boy's own voice, a voice that is both hard and tender, haunted by the weight of what he's done and what he's seen. He sees himself reflected in the eyes of his younger brother, Doodle, a fragile thing, marked by weakness from the start. The older boy craves a different brother, one who can keep pace, one who can share in the wild, untamed world he envisions. But Doodle is different. He is a bird with clipped wings, forever tethered to the earth.\n\nThe boy's actions, driven by this desperate need for connection, are tangled with pride and anger. He sees Doodle as a burden, a shadow that stains the purity of his own desires. The dark thought takes root, a viper coiled in his heart, whispering of a simpler solution, a way to erase the problem. But then, a smile. A spark of light in the darkness. And the boy falters. The bond, despite its ugliness, holds him back.",
            "The mind. A tangled thicket of thought. They've tried to map it, these men of science, with their tablets of wax and their scrolls of papyrus. Then came the books, the printed word, and finally, the cold steel logic of the machine. But the mind, it ain't no machine. No clockwork contraption. It's a fire, burning bright and fierce, consuming and transforming. \n\nIt takes in the world through senses raw and unfiltered: touch, heat, sound, light. Each a whisper in the dark, turned into whispers of electricity. The brain, it sifts through these whispers, decoding the patterns, building meaning from chaos. Like a sculptor chipping away at stone, it shapes the raw material into something recognizable. A box against a white void. A face in the crowd.\n\nBut there's more to it than just seeing. The mind, it has a filter, a watchful eye that decides what's worth keeping and what's to be cast aside. It lets you see the blade of grass, yet ignores the million others. It picks out your name in a cacophony of sound. A beacon in the storm.\n\nAnd then there's the holding, the storing. Memories, like ghosts, flit through the mind. Some linger a fleeting moment, others stay for a lifetime. Echoes in the chambers of the soul.  They say the mind, it weaves these memories into proteins, a tapestry of experience. \n\nThey've tried to map it, these scientists. Tried to find the patterns, the connections. But the mind, it's a labyrinth, a place of shadows and light. It defies easy explanation. It is, in the end, a mystery.",
            "The wind whispered through the chrome canyons of Huxley's Brave New World, a world where comfort was king and the individual a ghost. The air itself hummed with the low thrum of machinery, a constant reminder of the iron grip technology held on the soul.  And at the heart of it all, the engine of commerce, a machine that churned out happiness like a factory churning out widgets. \n\nHuxley saw it coming, the shadow of this gilded cage. He saw the way the masses, conditioned from birth, chased fleeting pleasures, their minds dulled by the constant drip of manufactured contentment. They were pawns, each one, in a game played by the World Controller, their desires molded, their thoughts pre-sorted, their wills surrendered. \n\nHe spoke of homogeny, of reification, words that resonated with the echoes of Marx, a ghost in the machine. For Huxley saw the threads of capitalism, the tendrils that choked the life out of the human spirit. False consciousness, he called it, a veil woven from the threads of desire, obscuring the true nature of their servitude. \n\nThe lower castes, Deltas and Gammas, lived in a fog of instant gratification, their need for consumption their only driving force. Hypnopædia, a sleep-learning device, pumped the mantra of consumerism into their dreams, a constant whisper urging them to buy, to spend, to be empty vessels filled with things. \n\nAnd the alphas, the Betas, they saw it, but they were complicit. Ensconced in their gilded cages, they turned a blind eye to the suffering below. For they, too, were part of the machine, their own desires carefully curated, their freedom an illusion. \n\nLove, true love, was a ghost in this world. The characters moved through their lives like puppets, their interactions shallow, transactional. The men saw women as objects, their bodies gleaming under the fluorescent lights. The women spoke of their encounters with a clinical detachment, their emotions carefully controlled.\n\nHuxley painted a bleak picture, a world where technology and capitalism had devoured the soul, leaving behind a hollow shell of humanity. A world where the individual was nothing, a cog in the vast machine of progress.  He showed us the mirror, and in its reflection, we saw the shadows of our own future.",
            "The stone buildings of University Park had held me for two and a half years, four and a half semesters. Getting across this spread, this campus, was a trial for many, myself included. My first year, I was lodged in East Halls, near as far east as you could go, save for the steel and concrete behemoths they called stadium and center. Willard, a stone's throw from the heart of it all, felt a county away. A quarter hour, maybe half, afoot, if the sky wasn't weeping, which it often did in this place.\n\nAn old boy, not much different from myself, told me that the East Halls were once islands, surrounded by fields and silence. Now, those fields were choked with gridirons and brick and mortar, new buildings like the Creamery and a place for healing. Apartments ringed the whole thing, a concrete embrace. The campus grew, ate itself alive, and the paths grew ever more convoluted. What then was a boy to do?\n\nThe bicycle, I reckoned. But a bike alone was a hollow promise. It took a rider, a will, and a world built for wheels.\n\nI spoke with a friend, a man who'd rediscovered the two-wheeled path after years of neglect. \"Why'd I ever stop?\" he said, a grin on his face. \"They're too damn good. A few years, it wasn't cool. Now, it's just the way to get around.\"\n\nGood for the body, good for the soul, efficient as a bolt of lightning. Oatmeal and sweat, you could cover miles.\n\nThese days I live beyond the campus, as far from the center as some of those dorm rooms. The smartest thing I did? Bought a bike. Thomas building, where I spend most of my days, a twenty-five-minute walk from my door. A bike? Five minutes, if I pushed hard enough.\n\nThere's a road, Pollock Road, straight as an arrow, but treacherous. A storm of metal and noise, even for a bike. Walking's fine, but I haven't the time. Without the bike, I'd be walking, stuck in the muck of time. Thirty, forty minutes every day, that's two and a half hours a week. Add to that the rest, the appointments, the errands, and I'd be lost in the labyrinth."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The work of tending to the broken, to the children bruised and battered by the world's indifference, has called to me for some time. It is a path I see myself walking, amongst those lost in the labyrinth of family and neglect, with the Division of Family and Children Services. To serve, to respect, to hold fast to the thin line of what is ethical, these are the cornerstones I bring to the table. Not just for the work, but for the living of it. \n\nIt's a calling that's been there, a whisper in the wind since youth. I've seen folks turn away from their troubles, bury them deep, or lash out in ways that leave scars deeper than the flesh.  A bachelor's in psychology, a degree earned at Piedmont College in '09, offered some understanding but not a guidepost.  A summer break stretched before me, uncertain. Then, a friend introduced me to a boy, sixteen years old, perched on her worn couch, his eyes shadowed with fear. He was running, fleeing the storm of his own home, abused by the hands that should have protected him. The next day, news came that he'd called the police. I drove to his house, drawn by a need to help, a graduate with a degree and a heart full of questions.  The law, it seemed, had turned away.  His parents, pale and slick with nervous sweat, spun tales of a manipulative child, twisting the truth to shield themselves. It was then, in that flickering light of a summer evening, that the path became clear. I would be a voice for the voiceless, a shield for the broken.\n\nThis work, it demands more than just compassion. It demands a fire in the belly, a hunger for justice. We speak of the individual, of their worth, yet we strive to mold them all into the same shape, to fit them into the cracks of conformity.  I refuse to be a cog in that machine. My actions have always spoken louder than words: colors on my hair, clothes that defied the norm, piercings that challenged tradition. I stood with the GSBA, a banner against the tide of prejudice.  I fight against injustice wherever I see it, a lone voice against the chorus of silence.",
            "The paper takes on the weigh of the Biological and Sociocultural models, set against the landscape of insomnia. The Biological model, a stark terrain of genes passed down and the body's own ailments, holds sway. The Sociocultural, it peers into the shadows of environment, tracing the lines of race, ethnicity, and the weight of circumstance.  This review seeks to traverse these models, charting the course of each study chosen to illuminate their paths. The findings, like whispers in the wind, are then laid bare, their strengths and weaknesses exposed to the light.\n\nSleep disorder, a beast with many heads, can be many things: primary, born of the mind itself; secondary, a shadow of another illness; or a consequence of some unseen ailment or the taking of strange substances. The Primary sleep disorders, Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, stand as sentinels. Dyssomnias –  Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and the unnamed Dyssomnia – these are the troubles that plague the act of sleeping itself. The Parasomnias, on the other hand, are the nightmares made flesh – Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and the rest, a symphony of unsettling occurrences. Sleep disorders entwined with other mental ailments are bound to the weight of Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review, however, focuses on insomnia, a wanderer in the night, and the broader realm of primary sleep disorders, viewed through the lenses of the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model, a map of flesh and blood, points to the genes we inherit and the body's own whispers.  Neurons in the hypothalamus, those tiny stars in the darkness, contain orexin, the conductor of sleep and wakefulness.  One study, conducted on mice, has illuminated the presence of GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, receptors that hold the key to sleep's embrace. When activated, they usher in the gentle embrace of sleep. But when silenced, anxiety recedes, and slumber comes calling. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, has been shown to lengthen the hours of sleep in these small creatures (Matsuki et al., 2009). This, perhaps, holds a mirror to our own sleep-deprived condition, suggesting that the genetic and environmental blueprints that shape these receptors in mice might echo in us as well. A flawed receptor, a missing piece, could be the silent architect of sleepless nights, a thief of rest, leaving us to grapple with the mundane and the meaningful alike. The Sociocultural implications are stark: If this phenotype is inherited, the ability to sleep, a fundamental human need, could be irrevocably altered. The impact, a ripple through the fabric of life, would touch the schoolroom, the workplace, and the everyday struggles of focus and concentration.",
            "The wind whispers of a darkness in the ear, a hollowness where sound should be. This paper will speak of this shadow, of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD as the learned men call it. First, a glimpse at the nature of the affliction. Then, the signs, the whispers that betray its presence. And finally, a path, a light in the dark, for those tasked with guiding a child through the labyrinth of sound.\n\nCAPD, they say, is a failure of the mind to translate the world's whispers into meaning. The ear itself may catch the sound, but the brain, that great echo chamber, fails to make sense of it. It is a deafness of the soul, not of the ear. Words blur, voices blend, and the world becomes a cacophony of indistinguishable noise.\n\nThe shadow has been known since the mid-century, first called \"auditory imperception.\"  Like a ghost, it has haunted the halls of science, studied by men like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, and Kimura, who sought to map its presence. A conference in '77, a tremor in the earth, brought the whispers into the light.\n\nCAPD wears many faces. It can be the inability to locate sound, to discern one voice from another, to follow the thread of a conversation. It can be the inability to hear the music in the world, the subtle shifts in tone that speak volumes. The world becomes a flat, featureless landscape where sound is but a dull roar.\n\nTo diagnose this affliction, one must listen closely, not just to the words, but to the silences, the hesitations, the missed cues. Tests abound, some simple, some complex, probing the mind for signs of the shadow. But there is no single key, no map to unravel its mystery. The cause, shrouded in darkness, remains elusive.",
            "The play, Twelfth Night, it speaks to a kind of truth.  That disguise, while it can serve a purpose, a dark and twisting purpose, it can also devour a man whole.  To shed the mask, to return to the skin beneath, that's the hard part.  And in shedding it, one risks the cold hand of estrangement.  To hold onto the lie, or to cleave to those bound to you, that's the burden a man must bear.  Some may forgive the deception, some may not. And those who don't, they'll carry the sting of it like a brand.\n\nThe game of pretense, when it comes to gender,  it's a dangerous one.  Why does a soul choose to walk in another's shoes?  Why does it feel the need to bury its own face beneath a borrowed mask?  Viola, she found herself adrift, a castaway on a strange shore. She donned the guise of Cesario, a man's clothing, a man's name, a shield against the hungry eyes of the world.  \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\"  These were the words she spoke, a promise whispered into the teeth of the storm.  But the mask, it isolates. It cuts a man off from the warmth of his own kind. And in this case, it even bloomed into a twisted love, a love born of misunderstanding. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\"  And the ghost of a love unacknowledged, a love that should never have been, lingered between Viola and Orsino.  \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" \n\nThis, perhaps, is the play's true heart.  That deception can force truth to the surface, to twist and writhe beneath the skin.  Did Olivia love Cesario for the man he pretended to be, or did she see a reflection of her own hidden desires?  A dangerous question, one that lingers in the shadows.  But the play offers no easy answers.  It is a story of masks and shadows, of love that blooms in the dark and truth that bleeds out like a wound.",
            "The iron fist of the German Reich had left its mark on the land, a stain of blood on the sand. The Ovaherero and Namaqua, driven to their knees, their bones scattered like dust in the wind.  But a single brushstroke cannot capture the whole canvas.  The Kaiser’s empire, vast and sprawling, held within it a thousand shades of cruelty.  Each colony a whisper of a different song, sung in different tongues, under a thousand different suns.  \n\nSo it was with education.  In Tanganyika, the British found a people stirred, a spark of knowledge kindled by the Germans.  In Kamerun, too, the word spread, carried on the backs of birds and the whispers of the wind.  But in South West Africa, a different story unfolded.\n\nThere, the iron grip was tighter, colder.  The government, distant and uncaring, left the burden of teaching to the missionaries, their hands stained with the same blood that soaked the ground.  The whites, they were different.  They were given schools, their minds oiled with knowledge, their thirst for power quenched by schooling.  But the natives?  They were left to wander in the shadows, their spirits untamed, their minds untouched.\n\nThe scars of this neglect ran deep, a wound that festered long after the Germans had packed their bags and moved on.  While other colonies boasted of literate men and women, South West Africa remained steeped in darkness, a land where the majority remained silent, unlearned, and unseen.  \n\nThis is the story I seek to tell: the story of South West Africa, a story of neglect and indifference, a story of a people denied their birthright. I will delve into the heart of the matter, unearthing the whispers of the past, the secrets buried beneath the sands of time.  I will examine the attitudes of the settlers, the cold calculus of colonial power, and the weight of history that crushed the dreams of a nation.",

Genres bloom and wither, echoes of one another, rock and country, jazz and folk, all tangled together like weeds in a field. But the noise they call heavy metal, that's a different story. It's a thing that hungers, a beast with a thousand heads, each one howling its own darkness.\n\nIt started forty years back, a whisper in the shadows.  But soon enough, men saw the power in it, the way it could twist and turn, contort itself into something new.  They carved out their own little niches, their own private hells, each more elaborate than the last. Now the whole world's drowning in it.\n\nThey say it's music, this metal. But it's more than that.

It's a music that bleeds.\n\nAnd in its veins, there runs a current of sickness. Drugs, they say.  The haze of the seventies, it seeped into the marrow of the music, turned their minds inside out. They chased the shadows, the ghosts in the machine. They found something dark down there, something primal, something terrifying. \n\nThey sang of it, these metal men.  They sang of the darkness in us all, the beast that lies dormant beneath the skin. They sang of Helter Skelter, the Beatles' own descent into madness.  It was a warning, a glimpse into the abyss.  They were saying, listen. This is what happens when the music gets too loud.",
            "The sun bled across the canvas, long shadows stretching from the trees like the limbs of some slumbering giant. A woman stood there, eyes wide as the night sky, adrift in a landscape spun from dreams. She was a figure from another time, another world, a world Henri Rousseau had built with his own hands. \n\nDecades before the Surrealists, before they bled their visions onto the white walls, Rousseau had been crafting his own dreams.  His brushstrokes, thick and deliberate, were the scaffolding of his desires. The Dream, that canvas from 1910, was more than just a woman lost in wonder. It was Rousseau himself, wrestling with the demons of ambition. He yearned for the accolades of the world, the whispers of praise from those who knew the weight of a brushstroke.  But the path to recognition was a thorny one. \n\nHe could walk the well-worn paths of convention, mimicking the styles that hung in the gilded galleries, or he could forge his own way, his own truth, a path that might lead to solitude. The choice, like the dream itself, was a perilous one.\n\nRousseau's story was etched in the dust of his own life. Born into the bourgeois world, he had known neither the solace of fine art training nor the luxury of early acclaim. He toiled for the state, a gabelou, a man of numbers and tollbooths. His dreams were a refuge, a balm for the wounds inflicted by loss. He had buried children, wives, and dreams in the cold earth.  \n\nBut the hunger for recognition gnawed at him. He saw the masters, the prodigies who rose to fame in the Parisian salons, and he felt the sting of inadequacy.  He was an outsider, a man who painted with the heart of a peasant, not the polish of a Parisian.\n\nJan Gordon, in his book on the modern French painters, spoke of a kind of kinship between Rousseau and Matisse, two men who stood on opposite sides of the art world's divide. Matisse, a man who feared banality, and Rousseau, a man who craved acceptance.  Two souls driven by a thirst, one for originality, the other for belonging.",
            "The old talk, the one about beauty being truth and truth beauty, it ain't just talk.  There's a bone deep reason for it. Keats, he knew it.  \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" he said.  That's all you need to know, he said.\n\nWe learn a lot in life.  From books, from streets, from the sting of experience. But these things, ethics and beauty, they seep in different. You can't teach them like addition or the names of birds. They're not rules to be followed, but whispers in the dark. We try to explain them, sure, dissect a painting or a poem, talk about its parts. But it ain't the brushstrokes that make the Mona Lisa sing, or the words on the page that make a story bleed truth. There's a something, a ghost in the machine, that can't be nailed down.\n\nO'Connor, she knew it too. A story, she said, is a way to say what can't be said. A statement, that's too small.\n\nEven when we describe a thing to death, there's still a gap. An echo. And that's where the power lies. Wittgenstein, he said it plain: ethics can't be spoken. It's beyond words.  That's the connection between art and morality, that thing that sings in the bones. They both touch a place we can't quite reach.\n\nLiterature, it's the closest. McKean, he said it lives and breathes values. It's not just entertainment, it's a mirror held up to what matters. And maybe that's what makes us human, this need to find meaning in the messy beauty of it all.",
            "The German lands. They call it a strong nation now. United. A tapestry woven from the shadows of the Alps in München's cold embrace, stretching to Kiel's salt-bitten shores. This same blood runs through Köln, a river city on the Rhine, through the heart of the land, and out to Dresden, a Saxon city clinging to the Elbe. A land forged from many fires, many stories. \n\nGermania. The name itself a whisper from the past, a ghost story debated by men with books. Tacitus, he claimed it came from the Tungrians, a tribe before they crossed the Rhine, before the clash with the Gauls. (Tacitus, 98.) Caesar, he used the word \"Germanus\" in his tales of Gaul, a line drawn in the sand between the conquered and the unconquered. From the Gauls themselves he took it, a word to mark the difference. Some say it meant neighbor, a sound in a tongue long gone. Caesar, in the first chapter of his first book, wrote: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others speak of a spear, a \"ger\", or a shout, \"garim\", a word from the ancient Irish. The Germans, they were loud, they were fierce.\n\nTacitus, that old Roman, he wrote in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" a tale of beginnings. \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal,\" he wrote. \"Not mixed, not touched by other races.  Who would leave the warmth of Asia, the sun-baked sands of Africa, for this land? For Germany, with its wild heart, its skies that weep, its people with eyes that hold the shadows?\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not yet. They would come for trade, for gold, for the trinkets that whispered of a wilder land. They would come with their legions, their swords glinting in the sun, but they would go back, back to the empire that sprawled like a beast beneath the sun.\n\nThe Germanic tribes, they lived on the edges, on the border of the Roman world. They traded their wares, their furs and their skills. Some joined the ranks of the Roman legions, soldiers of fortune. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "Down I looked. The view a blank slate against the gray. Mind a still pond, reflecting without feeling. Eyes sharp, studying the contours, the shapes, the shades, but the mind, it held back. Thoughts flickered like fireflies, in and out, never settling. It was like a film passing through, a rush of images, no real meaning, just the cold, hard truth of what was there.\n\nOnce, a man I worked with, a painter, he gave me a book. \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" it was called. Said it could teach a man to see. To see the world not as it seemed, but as it was.  I'd wanted to draw since I was a boy, always watching, always wanting to capture the world on paper. The book, it talked about lines, about how the brain took those lines and made them mean something. It talked about framing, about taking a cluttered scene, a bowl of fruit on a table in a room, and making it simple, just the bowl, just the fruit, just the plane it sat on.\n\nAt that moment, staring down at this bowl, this brown bowl, I couldn't see the frame. I was lost in the details, the texture of the brown, the way it sat in the bowl, the way the light caught the curve of the sides. Picasso had his blues, Monet his greens, the Italians, they painted rainbows. If I was to paint, if I was to make something, this was it. This was the start. My brown world.\n\nMy hand reached out, fingers trembling, towards the brush, a stick of wood and bristles. Muscles tense, then relax, the hand moving, trying to make sense of the world. This could be it. This could be the moment.\n\nWater swirled, smooth and clear. A piece broke off, floated away, lost in the gray. Muscles tightened again, a jerky motion, a frantic push. The handle slammed against the porcelain. The brown, it wouldn't move. Stuck, clinging to the bottom of the bowl like a burr on a dog's fur.\n\n\nA mop, held loosely in my hand. Feet planted, tie a noose around my neck.  I stared at the brown mess, the offering left by some nameless soul. A few more flushes, a few more moments of silence, then my hand reached out, grabbed the paper, and began to wrap myself in it, like a mummy, until all that was left was a pale, white shape against the brown.\n\nStraightening, I bent down, my hand dipped into the bowl. A mother reaching into a hot oven, taking out her offering.",
            "The young ones are dying behind the wheel. A reckoning unfolds in the steel and glass cages they call cars. The sickness lies deep, in the marrow of the adolescent brain, not yet formed for the weight of the road. Inexperience, a hollow echo in the steel canyons, a siren song to the grave.  More crashes, more spills, more recklessness. Speeding, veering, a dance with oblivion.\n\nThey ride with their kind, these young ones, a pact sealed in the back seat. The numbers tell the tale, etched in blood and metal. California, a land of sun and shadows, has tried to hold them back, a provisional shield, a leash on the wild heart. But it's a bandage on a broken limb.\n\nThe truth is, they're not ready. Not for the burden of the wheel, not for the cold geometry of the highway. A doctor, Zuckerman, calls it a sickness, a yearning for the sting of the abyss. Eighteen, he says, too young. They crave the rush, the surge of adrenaline, the kiss of danger.\n\nThe tide is coming, a wave of young blood, the children of the boomers, eager and reckless.  They'll flood the roads, a storm of steel and flesh. Unchecked, the death toll will rise, a mountain in the desert of their lives.\n\nWe must act. No more licenses for the young.  Let them learn, let them study, let them feel the weight of the responsibility. Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen—let them wait. Let the wildness subside, let the hunger for death abate.\n\nThen, when they're ready, when the road whispers a promise instead of a threat, let them take the wheel. Until then, let them walk, let them learn, let them live.",
            "The Library of Congress, a repository of old things, held a collection of Edison’s flickering pictures. Fifteen of them, these trick films, from the time before the turn of the century. Illusions, they were, woven from the threads of edited moments.  \n\nI saw them, these ghosts of a forgotten age, and tried to make sense of their strange poetics. Most were bound to a stage, a proscenium arch framing their silent drama. The camera, a watchful eye, never moved. Long shots, medium shots, that was all. No close-ups, no intimacy. It was the theatre they mimicked, the vaudeville, the magic shows, where the whole was seen at once. The figures moved side-to-side, confined by the proscenium's confines.\n\nLike actors in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), they walked the stage, never coming closer, never receding.\n\nEach picture, a thought, a single idea captured. One shot, one film. A minute or less, fleeting as smoke. These were not stories, not in the way we understand them. They were tricks, fleeting moments of wonder, magic, a vanished hand, a sudden disappearance. \n\nBut look closer, at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). The head, severed, a phantom, a moment of illusion built from a joining of glimpses.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a man of the soil, a farmer through and through, he was. Republicanism ran in his blood, a fire that burned bright in his belly. His life, bound to the earth, had forged him into a man of conviction, a voice raised in defense of freedom, against the creeping hand of government.  His creed, born of the fields, bled into every thought, every word he spoke. He saw the good in the land, in the sweat of man’s brow, and believed it the foundation of a just society.  \n\nHe saw in the young nation a chance to forge something new, unburdened by the ghosts of old. No king, no tradition to bind them. A government of the people, by the people, he believed, was the only true path.  He spoke of natural rights, of a balance delicate as a spider’s web, where the denial of one thread unravelled the whole. These rights, he said, must be kept from the grasp of power, for they were the lifeblood of a free man. He saw the state of nature, the brutal world before civilization, where strength ruled and the wicked prospered. But in this new world, he preached, there must be another way.\n\nTo build this ideal, he argued, government must be tempered by the very nature of man. Good and evil, he believed, were woven into the fabric of our being.  He saw government as a mirror, reflecting the virtues and vices of its creators. He spoke of  principles, the bedrock of a just society - the protection of property, the nurturing of the land, the restraint of unchecked greed. He believed that even the most flawed government, if built on these principles, could find some measure of fairness. For he knew, as a farmer knows the seasons, that self-interest was the engine of man. But it could be harnessed, turned to the common good, or it could lead to ruin, to a world where the strong devoured the weak.\n\nA strict construction, he demanded of the Constitution. A government limited, restrained, its power confined to the words written on the page. He feared the reach of a sprawling federal power, its cost breeding tyranny. But he knew that a literal reading, devoid of intent, could be a dangerous weapon in the hands of the ambitious.  He looked to the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution, as the true charter of the nation. It spoke of sovereign states, a union of equals, not a singular entity.",
            "The figures, they spoke of a fall. A steep one, in the third month.  December.  Snow falling on the New England ground, a shroud upon the campus. Fewer bicycles, fewer feet on the path. The semester's end, a flurry of papers and grades, a weight settling on the mind.  The log, it slipped from the frayed edges of their memory. The holidays, a long shadow stretching across the month, a time for leaving, for absence. January, the silence of a new year, the campus bare.  Then, a flicker. A spark, perhaps, in March. The Carpool Challenge, a last gasp of effort. A brief surge in the numbers. But the truth, it lingered like smoke in the air. The natural ebb and flow. The pull of the machine.\n\nThey say freedom lies in the wheel. It's a song woven into the fabric of this land. A siren song. To break free, you need a lure, a whisper of something more. Gifts, they offered. Small tokens, trinkets of comfort. Coffee, books, massages. A taste, a glimpse of something else. But what of a grander prize? A bicycle, gleaming in the sun. A machine that runs on air. A car that whispers of a different future. A promise of something more. Perhaps then, the numbers would rise, a testament to the changing tide.",
            "The thing they call an ETF. A packaged security. Designed to track some marker, some index, maybe a commodity or a whole basket of things. Like an index fund, but more nimble. Trades like stock on a board.\n\nIt offers the spread of the index fund, sure. But with the bite of a single share. You can short, you can go on margin, buy a single goddamn share. The fees though, they're leaner than a starving dog.  \n\nBut there's a cost. A commission each time you move. Like a toll on the road. \n\nAnd the variety, it's vast.  A whole goddamn ocean of choices.\n\nBut a smart man, he questions everything.  He looks at those promises, those benefits, diversification, and asks: how deep do they run?\n\nWe'll be lookin' at this IHF thing.  Comparing it to its top ten holdings. See if the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts. See if there's a better way to stack those stones, a tighter grip on the return, a lower tilt in the wind.\n\nWe ain't got time to measure every goddamn piece.  So we'll focus on the ten big ones. They hold most of the weight, 63.58% of the whole damn thing.\n\nWe'll see what these ten say about the IHF.  We'll calculate their beta, their return, how they move together.  See if they whisper the same song as the whole damn chorus.\n\nThe numbers tell a story. The top ten, they offer a return 6.11% higher. A goddamn sixteen percent jump. And their beta, it's a shade lower, a little more steady.\n\nBut is it enough?  Are these differences real, or just a whisper in the wind?  We gotta dig deeper, see if the data holds water.  We'll measure the standard deviation, the spread of those ten stocks. See if it matches up to the IHF.\n\nThe truth, it's out there somewhere.  We just gotta dig it up.",
            "Dream-Land. One of Poe's own words, he called it a good one. A poem where the word Thulé, it appears twice, like a shadow, in lines six and fifty-six. Mabbott, he says it comes from Virgil, an old man with a fancy for islands north of Britain. An island the Greeks thought was the edge of everything. Virgil, he used it, that much is sure. But there's another road, a more recent one, that some whisper about. Poe, he was drawn to the German tongue, to the dark whispers of their words. \n\nThis quote, it speaks of a familiarity, a knowing. Arndt, in his book about Poe and Goethe, he sees the marks of imitation, a reflection in the mirror. Two poems, two souls grappling with the same deep well of sorrow. \n\nOxford, they call it a Companion, this book of English Literature. Inside, it speaks of Goethe, a man who built his name on the play Faust, a story in two parts, the first a sigh in the year 1808, the second a death rattle in 1832. But within the second part, a smaller poem resides, a whisper called \"The King of Thulé\". A king, his queen gone, a goblet left behind. He drinks, he weeps, remembers. His grief, a tide that drowns him. He gives away his treasures, keeps only the goblet, a reminder of the light that's gone. He walks to the edge, the sea a dark maw below, throws the goblet in, closes his eyes, and lets go. \n\nThe King of Thulé, a shadow of Poe's own darkness. A reflection in the abyss. Faust, it took form on the stage in 1842, a year before Poe used Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". A year that echoed with the ghosts of loss. \n\nThulé, it appears twice in Poe's works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", he whispers \"ultma Thule\". But in \"Dream-Land\", it frames the poem, a bookend to a world consumed by sorrow. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\", twin poems, born from the same wellspring of despair. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\", he steps into Goethe's world, a world of darkness, of loneliness, of ghosts that haunt the edges of memory. A world where color fades, and only the echoes of loss remain. \n\nGoethe, a giant in the world of words, a name Poe would have known, even if it was only through the reverence he held for Tennyson. \n\nBut there were other paths, other ways to encounter Goethe's work. Reproductions, whispers carried on the wind, a world where his words found new homes.",
            "The law in California, it speaks of malice. A customer, she slips and falls on a mess of applesauce, a spilled offering in the maw of the grocery store. Could this court, might it see fit to award her not just for the hurt she’s suffered, but also for the sting of a punishment, a reckoning for the man who ran the store?\n\nA judge, he’s not likely to toss out the woman’s claim, not so easily. To win the right for such a punishment, she must show that the store manager’s actions were deliberate, a disregard for the hurt that might come. His heart, it must have been cold, knowing the danger, knowing what might befall another soul. She’ll say that he knew, the manager, that the slick floor was a threat.  Spills like this, they’d happened before, others had fallen.  He’d been warned twice, once by one man, then another. Yet he chose to eat his dinner while the danger lay in wait.\n\nBut the woman, she’ll have to argue harder still that the manager’s heart was truly black, that he was not just careless but cruel. Six times before in that year, folks had fallen, tripped, hurt themselves on the slick floors of his store.  He’d seen the danger, and he’d turned away.\n\nShe says it happened on a day in October, the thirteenth to be exact. A clock struck five, and a worker told the manager, this Paul Martin. Applesauce, he’d been told, a puddle in the aisle. “Dinner break,” the manager said, “no time for complaints.” Fifteen minutes passed, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, she warned him again. Same answer. By half past five, the woman, Jennifer Palmer, she slipped and fell. Her back, it was broken, her life forever changed.\n\n\nThe law in California, it speaks of malice. This manager, he knew the danger. Six times he’d been warned. Did he act with malice? Did he act with a heart that was cold?",
            "Four years gone now. A semester spent under the fluorescent hum of CBC's classrooms, wrestling with the question of Islam.  Hostile faith they called it.  A question whispered then, a question that now echoes louder than ever.  The world since the fall, a pendulum swing from fear to an almost suffocating acceptance. Could a man named Obama, with the ghost of his heritage clinging to him like a shroud, ever have worn the mantle of President back then?  \n\nThe Prophet's biography, a tangled thread of contradictions.  I'd heard the stories, the tales of conquest and forced conversion.  A sword at the throat, Islam the price of survival.  But this book, it painted a different picture.  A martyr misunderstood, a man humbled, seeking truth in the dust.  They say the people came to him, drawn by some unseen light.\n\nAnd there's a strange echo, a resonance between the ministries of these men, Jesus and Muhammad.  The multiplication of mutton and milk, a whispered miracle, a shared hunger.  A deliberate mirroring, perhaps, to elevate Muhammad, to cast him as a man of truth, a silent, unassuming force.  But it feels like a theft, a shadow play where one light steals the brilliance of another.\n\nThe stories, too, they feel manufactured, stacked like cards in a house of cards.  He heard from her, she heard from him, a whisper chain stretching back into the desert.  Proof, they say, of the truth's enduring power.  But the distance, the layers, they cast a shadow on the story itself, a whisper of doubt.\n\nThe biographer's intent, to lift Muhammad to a pedestal, to crown him with humility and wisdom.  But history, a stubborn thing, whispers a different tale.  Can those who follow him, those who claim his mantle, truly know the man behind the myth?",
            "The word of the man from Nazareth, his own teachings, they were cast aside like a worn cloak in the years after his passing.  Christianity, a river swollen by time, flowed on, ever changing its course.  The world, a restless beast, moved forward, a tide of progress washing over all.  The old ways clung to the shores, but their voices were faint, lost in the roar of the current.  A hunger will rise in the hearts of men, a yearning to sift through the layers of dogma, to find the man, the man beneath the monument.  It will take time, decades, perhaps centuries, but the tide will turn.  The river will run back up its course, seeking the source.\n\nThe doctrines, the pronouncements, they will fall away, one by one, like stones from a crumbling wall, until only the echo of his voice remains.  Across the land, in the halls of the church, the faithful will gather, their heads bowed, their ears open to the whisper of his words.  But the church, it will remain, a fortress of faith against the storm.  And though the river flows backward, the waters will run clear, the faith will find its unity.\n\nHistory is a wheel, turning ever onward, yet always returning to its center.  The Empire that once persecuted the followers of the Nazarene, it became the vessel of their faith.  The chains of slavery, they too fell, giving way to the rise of a new order.\n\nNow, the wheel turns once more, seeking the heart of the matter.  The differences, the factions, they will dissolve, leaving behind a single, clear image of the man, the man who walked the earth.  And in his words, not as pronouncements, but as whispers, as parables, the truth will be found.\n\nLook back, far back, to the time before the man.  Look to the people who walked the dusty roads of Judea.  They were a diverse people, divided by their own beliefs, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, all seeking the face of God.  Theirs was a faith, ancient and deep, a root from which the tree of Christianity would grow.",
            "The muck of it all. That's what Sinclair shows you. The hunger in men's bellies ain't just for food. It's for power, for more. The bosses, they're all the same. They build their empires of brick and steel, smoke billowing like a shroud against the sky. They see nothing but their own reflection in the glass towers, nothing of the grime clinging to the lives they grind beneath their wheels. \n\nHe paints a picture, stark and black, of the river of filth flowing from their factories, a sickness seeping into the ground, the air, the very bones of the city.  They don't care for the men who toil in the shadows, the men broken and bleeding in the name of progress. A dollar, that's all they see. A dollar and the endless churning of the machine, chewing up men and spitting them out like waste.\n\nSinclair speaks of a cauldron, seething with hate and jealousy.  Loyalty? Decency?  Lost in the stench of sweat and despair.  They'll lay you off with a flick of the wrist, no warning, no mercy. The law? A whisper in the wind.  The workers, they're slaves to a system built on their backs, their bodies broken, their dreams turned to dust.\n\nHe calls them slaves, and the word hangs heavy in the air.  Men trapped in a cage of their own making, their lives dictated by the whims of men who see them as nothing more than cogs in a machine. There's no escape, no light at the end of the tunnel. Just the endless grind, the gnawing hunger, and the crushing weight of a world that cares nothing for their souls.",
            "Some writers, they spin their words like a spider, weaving a web to catch the feelin' of a thing. They use tricks, these writers, some more cunning than others. Fitzgeral, he was a master of the trick. In his story, *The Great Gatsby*, he took words and slapped 'em together like mismatched puzzle pieces, makin' somethin' strange and new. He'd find a word, a color say, and give it a weight, a meaning that hung heavy in the air. Gold, green, white, red - these were his tools. He'd build a meaning around 'em, then use 'em to paint a picture, to make you feel somethin'. \n\nWhite and gray, these were his favorites. White, he made it mean somethin' clean, fancy, like a rich man's linen shirt. Gray, that was older, faded, like a memory lost in the dust. He planted these seeds early, all through the book. Everyone was wearin' white, like ghosts in a summer haze. Daisy, Jordan, Nick - all swathed in white. Even the way he talks about the parties, it's all white and dull, like a bleached bone.\n\nThen there's gray. The names, the cars, the land - all swallowed up by the grayness. Like the world itself was turnin' to ash. He took these colors, white and gray, and used them to show you somethin' about the people, about what they were really worth. Daisy, she becomes a ghost in white, a shell of a woman, floatin' through the story like a wisp of smoke.  \n\nFitzgerald, he knew how to use a color like a weapon. He'd paint a picture, and you'd feel it in your bones. That's the power of his words, the power of his vision.",
            "The San Diego sun beats down on a land fat with bounty. Tomatoes ripe for the picking, citrus heavy on the branches, greens unfolding like emerald hands. Squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, peppers – all flourish in this Eden of plenty. A hunger for the pure and the simple has taken hold, a demand for what grows from the earth unburdened. The people line up, lists in hand, yearning for the bounty of the organic harvest. Eggs, milk, the cream of the land, all free from the taint of artifice.\n\nThese same farms, they open their gates, inviting the curious in. Hikers tread paths between rows, their eyes drawn to the flitting wings of birds, the whisper of the wind through the leaves. A lesson learned, a connection forged, the land yielding its secrets. This, then, is the promise – to till the soil with care, to reap the rewards, and to offer a glimpse of the wild heart of the world.\n\nThe earth remembers. It yearns for balance.  Chemical poisons have poisoned the soil, choked the life from the land.  Organic farming, it whispers, a return to the ancient ways.  But it demands a different kind of labor, a patient hand, a constant vigilance.  To nurture the soil, to coax life from the earth, it requires sweat and toil. Losses are heavier, harvests smaller.\n\nThe path is not paved with gold, but with grit and determination. Planting cover crops, grazing with purpose, battling the encroaching weeds, it all takes its toll.  Yet the rewards are greater than mere profit. The land sings a song of abundance, a symphony of life.  A haven for the endangered, a refuge for the weary, a testament to the enduring spirit of the wild.\n\nThe land itself, it tells a story.  Cracked earth, chaparral clinging to life, a whisper of oak trees stretching towards the sky. A hundred species, some teetering on the edge, others rebuilding their lost dominion. The kangaroo rat, a phantom fleeting through the brush, the yellow-legged frog, a splash of color in a sun-baked pool. The gnatcatcher, a song on the wind, a reminder that even in this hardened land, beauty persists. \n\nThis land has seen the hand of man, the tread of cattle, the ghosts of homesteaders long gone. Now, a new chapter begins, a promise whispered on the breeze. To heal the earth, to honor the past, to build a future where man and nature walk side by side.",
            "Culture. A word worn thin by use. It ain't no thing you can hold in your hand. More like a shadow, stretching long and thin, defining the space a man moves in. It's what ain't there that matters as much as what is.  \n\nTo say all Russians are stubborn is to miss the point.  Like saying all deserts are sand. Sure, there's sand. But there's wind too. And heat. And secrets buried deep.\n\nUnderstandin' a culture ain't about boxes and labels. It's about the dirt beneath your boots, the language on your tongue, the ghosts that whisper in your ear.\n\nWhen you walk into a room, you see it through the lens of your own past. Comparisons rise up like smoke. But tryin' to change a culture is like tryin' to dam the river. It'll find a way around.\n\nBest to respect the currents. Learn the flow.  See the world through their eyes. Even when you're on shaky ground, a little respect can go a long way.\n\nAnd culture ain't just about borders. It's the walls inside a company too. Some places run on long hours and deadlines. Others on whispers and coffee breaks.  It's in the clothes they wear, the words they use, the way they treat each other.\n\nValues. Now those are the heart of a culture. What they hold dear. What they fear. \n\nIf a man's gotta save face, he ain't gonna stab his boss in the back to win a deal. And if a woman's gotta drive a hard bargain, she ain't gonna back down easy.\n\nKnow your enemy. Know their values. Know yourself. That's the key to any deal worth closin'.",
            "The fool has said it, in the dark corners of his heart: \"There is no God.\" These words, carved from the psalm stones of the Book, mark the opening of Anselm's inquiry. He seeks to prove the Lord, the God of the scriptures, a God bound by the pages of belief. Aquinas, another traveler on this path, holds the same conviction. But the question hangs heavy: whose argument rings truest? To answer that, we must first accept the premise, for the sake of this reckoning, that both these men believe in the same God, the God of the Bible. To wander from that path, to consider other gods, would be to stray from the heart of their discourse.\n\nYet, while both men grapple with the weight of the question, neither, I would argue, lays bare a foundation strong enough to stand against the winds of doubt.\n\nAnselm's journey begins within. He seeks the proof of God not in the rustle of leaves or the crash of waves, but in the chambers of the soul. His God is a truth, a concept, bound by the very act of understanding.  He posits that to conceive of God's absence is to fail to grasp the very nature of existence itself. His logic is a tangled web of faith, where the unseen is made known through the lens of the mind.  Anselm tells us to look inward, to find the Lord etched upon the tablets of our own being.\n\nAquinas, however, seeks a different kind of proof. He lays down five pillars of logic, each one a sturdy argument for the existence of God. Change, he argues, points to a mover. Causation demands a first cause. Contingency whispers of a necessary being. Degrees of excellence point to a supreme being. And harmony, the intricate dance of the cosmos, speaks of a divine architect.  He offers a God not of faith but of reason, a God that can be known through the cold, hard light of logic.\n\nBoth men grapple with the darkness, seeking the spark of divinity. But neither, in the end, offers a path free of shadows.",
            "In the time of shadows, a prince was born.  A prince who would be known as Buddha. He turned from the world, sought the silence, found the light. His words, they spread like wildfire, birthing a faith. A faith called Buddhism, its oldest form called Theravada.  Two and a half thousand years have passed since then.  The world has changed. Buddhism too. Even in Sri Lanka, a land where the faith took root deep, things are not as they were.  They hold ceremonies there, cutting the water, a dance of belief. Monks and layfolk join hands, whispering prayers. Buddha spoke not of this ritual, yet it persists.  The changes creep in, from the simple trappings to the heart of the matter. The Theravada people, both those who live in the temples and those who walk among men, they have had to shift, to adjust. The reasons are many, some born of darkness, some of light.\n\nCertain words will be heard often in this telling. Internal force, external force. Internal, the hand of those who follow the Buddha's path, whether cloaked in robes or not. External, the touch of those who dwell outside the faith. A hostile force seeks to wound, to tear down. A benign force, it matters not if harm comes or good, it stands apart.  \n\nFirst, we must look at the bedrock of belief, the core of Theravada.  The refuge is taken in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma is the ancient words, the Tripitaka, three baskets of wisdom.  The Sutta Pitaka holds the Buddha's words, the Vinaya Pitaka the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the nature of things. Anatta, no soul. Dukkha, the pain that is life. Anicca, the ever-changing world. Only by seeing these truths can one escape Sansara, the wheel of birth and death. Along with Sansara, desire and hatred and delusion will fade, leaving only enlightenment.  The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the rules of conduct. For the layfolk, five precepts:  no killing, no lying, no stealing, no wrong conduct, no intoxication. For the monks, a heavier burden, a stricter path. But at the heart of it all lies the four noble truths.  First, Dukkha: life is suffering. Second, attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The American nation and Mexico. Two countries bound by a blood-soaked history, a feud stretching back fifty-seven years, from eighteen thirty-six to eighteen ninety-three.  (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The high tide of that enmity crested in the Mexican-American War, a brutal reckoning between eighteen forty-six and eighteen forty-eight. The Americans, hungry for land, swallowed Mexico whole, claiming Texas and the Southwest as their own.  Before the guns fell silent on the Great War, there were skirmishes, standoffs, echoes of that ancient hatred.\n\nIt began with a clashing of cultures, a contest of faith and tradition.  Religion, language, ways of life – all a source of friction.  And beneath it all, the cold, hard truth of material interests. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nSuch is the way of nations, bound by proximity, their fates entwined.  Borders become lines in the sand, marking not just territory but the boundaries of their desires, their fears.  The United States and Mexico, two countries tethered by blood and bone, are but one example in a long litany of border disputes.  David M. Pletcher (1977)  speaks of a \"long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problem\" in Mexico and Cuba. (p. 41) A problem born of proximity, of a shared history stained with conflict. While others in Latin America found solace in the American embrace, Mexico and Cuba remained forever marked by that ancient animosity.\n\nReligion, a furnace of division, a tinderbox waiting for a spark.  Sally Frahm (2001) writes, \"If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy.\" (p. 86) \n\nLike the Cold War, the struggle between the United States and Mexico was a dance of ideologies, a contest of wills. But here, the battleground was faith, not political systems.  A legacy of distrust, inherited from the Spanish and the English, lingered like a curse, poisoning the well of good faith.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) catalog seventeen disputes between these two nations.  Most, territorial skirmishes, raids across the border, and the constant struggle to contain the violence that festered along the frontier.  Banditry, lawlessness, a constant shadow cast by the specter of violence. (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nAnd then, a shift. As Mexico's fate became inextricably linked to the American economy, the rivalry cooled, its intensity abated.  (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109).  American ambition shifted from territorial conquest to economic dominion, a slow, insidious tightening of the grip. (p. 110)  By the century's end, the old feud had waned, replaced by a new, more subtle form of control.",
            "Fifteen years gone. A sudden sickness, a thief in the night. Took hold, stole my strength. Never saw it coming.  Nurse I was then.  A choice made, a cage of duty.  \"Always work,\" they said. \"They'll always be sick.\"  A mantra whispered in my ear, a gilded promise. Science and words beckoned, but security, that was the siren song. The safety of helping others, a shield against the ghosts of my own childhood.\n\nBut the ground shifted. Forty-six years old.  Alone. Empty pockets.  The sickness, a shackle on my body. Fifteen years of Social Security, a meager pittance.  Nothing left.  Just the daily struggle. A gnawing hunger, not just for food, but for something more.  \n\nThere's a truth in the wreckage. Couldn't have survived this long without them.  Family. Friends.  A lifeline thrown in the face of the storm.   They held me up when the world spun dark. And believe me, when the real darkness comes, you find yourself small, insignificant, helpless.\n\nLife, it throws its punches.  Big ones.  Little ones.  No matter the armor you wear, some blows are too heavy to bear alone.\n\nThey talk of rugged individualism.  Of leaning on yourself. But look back. What sustained our fathers?  Not grit alone. It was kindness, a hand reaching out, a shared burden. The wagon trains, the pioneers, they crossed the land together.  They understood the strength in unity.\n\nSo yes, be ready. Have your supplies, your shelter, your plans.  I do.  The canned goods, the water filters, the tools.  But don't forget the other things.  The human connection.  Reach out your hand.  Ask for help. Offer it.  Build a community.  That's the real strength.",
            "The question of form, of how life takes the shape it does, has haunted man since he first looked upon the world. Why do creatures take the forms they do? Are there unseen hands guiding their evolution, some force shaping the course of change? Even now, a century after Thompson's lament that the zoologist could scarce dream of defining organic forms in numbers, the mystery remains. \n\nYet, men have sought to chart this course, to find the equations that govern the dance of life. They've used the language of mathematics to trace the growth of mollusks, the unfolding of their shells through time and space. Our own work seeks to unravel this mystery in the case of Prunum, these spiral-shelled creatures of the deep. We've taken to X-rays, peering into their silent forms, measuring, quantifying the curves and contours of their shells. These numbers then feed a machine, a digital forge called CerioShell, where hypothetical forms are born, possibilities explored. \n\nThe shell, itself, is a marvel. A tube winding through time, through 360 degrees of space. Each twist, each coil, a whorl, spiraling around an unseen axis, the columella. The speed of its growth, the size of its aperture, all tell a story, a silent chronicle of life's journey.  \n\nWe look at these shells from all sides, apical, basal, apertural, abapertural, seeking to understand the language of their form. We count the whorls, each a chapter in their history, and trace the path of the aperture, the mouth of the creature, as it moves through time and space.  \n\nIf we can understand this path, this trajectory, then perhaps we can begin to unravel the secrets of evolution, the forces that shape life's grand design.",
            "The death of babes in the cradle, the passing of infants, it clung to Indonesia like a shroud. For a decade, the toll remained a constant shadow.  The country, they said, was striving for the sun, chasing the Millennium's promises of water and clean living. Yet the health of mothers and children, that remained in the dark. Progress was a whisper, a sigh against the wind. The reasons, they would say, were many. A web of shortcomings, a call for a stronger hand to guide the whole of the health system, not just singular threads of intervention.\n\nThey spoke of births attended by hands skilled in the ways of healing. Seventy-two percent, they claimed, a number that rang hollow. For what use are midwives' touch when storms of complications rage? Hemorrhage, a silent thief, stole mothers in the night. A fragile facade of progress, a mirage in the desert. And the children, they suffered too. Diarrheal fever, a scourge, claimed its victims with a chilling frequency, left untended by the healing hands. Postnatal care, a whispered prayer, unanswered in too many corners.\n\nCesarean births, a scar on the flesh, were rare. Four percent, a meager offering. The shadows of inequity stretched long. In cities, the steel-eyed surgeon's hand was common. In the villages, a shadow lingered, a mere two percent. Access, a privilege, a gulf between the haves and the have-nots.  The poor, burdened by the weight of cost, were left adrift on a sea of despair.\n\nWhat then, the question lingered, how to mend the broken threads? Should they weave a tapestry of targeted programs, or strengthen the loom that held the whole fabric of health? The allure of the singular thread was strong. A quicker fix, a more manageable knot. But beware the pitfalls. For the weight of one program, one intervention, could pull down the threads of others. The shadow of funding, a fickle beast, would consume all, leaving other areas starved. And the endless duplication, a maddening labyrinth of forms and whispers, would choke the life out of the system.",
            "Victorian fictions, they swarm with detail, fixated on the powdered wigs and silks of a dying age. Yet some, like *Oliver Twist* and *Wuthering Heights*, they turn away from the gilded cage. These tales spin a thread of mystery, a touch of the uncanny, a deviation from the expected, sharpening the edges of their characters, laying bare the gnawing hunger that drives them, the shadows that dance in their hearts. \n\n*He was caught in a maelstrom of thoughts, a howling wilderness in his mind. The voices of Sikes and Crackit, their words like stones thrown against a skull, echoed in the chambers of his soul. He was both witness and participant, caught in a tangled web of their malice. Then, a sudden crack, a flash of light, a roar that split the night. A tumult of cries and shouts, a kaleidoscope of flickering flames, and he, a puppet in unseen hands, was dragged away. Through it all, a dull ache, a persistent throb of pain, a gnawing fear that clenched at his insides.*\n\nThese tales weave their mysteries in dreams, in visions that bleed into waking hours. In *Oliver Twist*, these phantasmagorias dig into the boy's soul, revealing the festering wounds, the terror that festers beneath the surface. When the bullet finds its mark, when Oliver is reborn in the crucible of death, he relives it all in a haze of fragmented memories, a nightmare he cannot escape. The passage speaks of helplessness, a soul adrift in a sea of pain. His senses are numbed, the world a blur of color and sound. He is a leaf tossed by the wind, carried away by forces beyond his control.\n\nThe shooting, it is not just a wound, it's a reflection of his powerlessness. He cannot fight, cannot even try to fight. His despair is palpable, a heavy shroud woven by Fagin's grim hand. It is a surrender, a slow acceptance of fate, a resignation to the cruel whims of a world that offers no solace. \n\n*The day bled into the night, a fleeting shadow against the canvas of eternity. There was no day, only the endless expanse of night, a suffocating silence broken only by the whisper of the wind.*",
            "A couple of years back I was workin' in one of them after-school programs, tutorin' the young'uns. Elementary kids, mostly. Tried to lend a hand wherever they needed it, but English and readin' was my strong suit. \n\nOld man Johnson, the program director, he pulled me aside one day. Said there was this boy, Adrian, maybe third or fourth grade, stuggledin' somethin' fierce with readin'. Seems to me somethin' were off. He'd pronounce some letters clean as a whistle, others like they were foreign tongue. Strange, real strange. Little fella was Latino, that much I knew, though he talked English like a born speaker.\n\nWe battled with it, day after day, till the day his mama walked in. I was mindin' a handful of strays while the rest of the kids were gone on some field trip, when she came in. Didn't speak a lick of English, her. Just Spanish. My Spanish was shakier than a newborn colt, just learnin' myself, but we managed a sort of conversation. And then it hit me, like a stray bullet,  Adrian weren't readin' wrong, he just didn't know the damn alphabet. Didn't know it like the back of his hand. \n\nDon't know if that ever did him much good, but I hope he's doin' alright.\n\nSee, I tell this story 'cause it's about the language barrier, the wall that stands in the way in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as clear cut as you think. Even a kid who speaks English like a songbird, readin' can be a hard climb. \n\nWe all agree this problem exists, right? So what the hell do we do? In Adrian's case, it was simple enough: a tutor, a good eye on the alphabet, how to sound out the words. But for kids who barely speak English at all, it's a different beast altogether. No easy answers there. Dual language programs, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, none of it's a magic bullet. It takes all of it, mixed together, like a good stew.\n\nFirst off, dual language programs ain't just for kids whose first tongue is Spanish. It's for everybody. Studies say kids in these programs, they learn better, faster. A lot of folks scared of those programs, thinkin' they waste money, that most kids won't get nothin' outta it. But that's a lie. If we made these programs the rule, not the exception, every kid would benefit.\n\nHow do we do it? Make every teacher bilingual? Now that's a tall order, ain't it? Unrealistic, maybe. But we can have assistants, tutors, call 'em what you will, folks who speak both languages.",
            "From the time a man first draws breath, the word is whispered: there's something out there. Bigger. Beyond knowing. Some are taught in houses of worship, some seek answers in the hush of their own souls. Many take the creed of their fathers, a worn map passed down through generations. But some, born defiant, deny the shadows, clinging tight to the small sphere of their own making.  They build their own shrines, their own gods, only to find them crumbling in the dust. We all walk a path, carving our own hollows in the endless night, searching for a flicker, a spark in the dark to guide us.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, smoke curling from his lips, the air thick with rain. We sat on the porch, the tin roof a drum against the storm. The gutters funneled water, drowning the brittle weeds at the edge. He looked out, eyes distant, lost in the drumming gray. Skin stretched thin over bone, his clothes hanging loose on a frame grown frail. Hair, once thick, now a sparse dusting on his head. He didn't meet my gaze. I felt the cold tug at my chest, a fear that choked the words. How could I speak of the chasm opening before us, of the inevitability of his passing?  So I held him, felt the tremor in his hand, and sat beside him, sharing the unsettling silence, the rain a constant, steady beat against the twilight.\n\nHe died in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The poisons they used, they kept him from the dirt a few months longer, but at what cost? The question hung in the air, unanswered, a bitter taste on my tongue. What god, I thought, would let this happen?  Alone in the darkness, I didn't pray. If he existed, he'd stopped listening long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to watch him go. The man who'd shaped me, the lifeblood of my being, fading into the void. I chose to remember him as he was, not as he'd become. I knew him better than anyone, better than his own blood. I knew he wouldn't want me there, a witness to his final breaths. So I curled in my bed for days, waiting for the news, the phone silent, a hollow space where his voice should have been.",
            "The Gothic, Watt calls it an oxymoron, \"Old-New.\" A contradiction in terms. Praised and damned, lauded for its terrible sublime, accused of being hollow.  Walpole, in his Castle of Otranto, the first of its kind, wove together the threads of ancient and modern romances. A new tapestry of words, stitched with echoes of the old theatricality, the raw mimicry of nature found in those newer, humbler tales. An \"old\" story, he called it, a Gothic Story.\n\nThe word itself, \"Gothic,\" a relic, a whisper from a time long past. Used to mark tribes and styles and ages, always cast as archaic, a shadow in the face of progress. Yet, in its shadow, a new light flickered.  The novel, a format still fresh, allowed the reader a glimpse into the mind, a close communion with the soul of the characters. This paradox, the ancient and the new, bound together in the Gothic, this is its enduring power. It remains both a fossil and a bloom, strange and familiar to those who read it centuries hence.\n\nChivalry, a ghost from the medieval halls, lingers in these stories. The training of a knight, the ideal of honor and courage, a reflection perhaps of what the writers saw lacking in their own time. Walpole, caught in the maelstrom of politics, facing whispers and accusations, may have yearned for that lost virtue. He saw it in the past, idealized and romanticized, a beacon in the darkness.\n\nFrederic, a character in the Castle, stands as a testament.  He is described, a prince, a figure of tragedy, marked by suffering and loss. The image is grand, a knight in shining armor, though exaggerated, a hint of the excess to come. Yet, even in the shadow of the impossible, there is a truth, a yearning for a world where honor still held sway.",
            "The flow of things. From want to want.  Goods snaking through the dark, a chain of bones, starting with the desire in the customer's eye. It winds back, a tendril of need, to raw material, to the forge, the factory floor, the rumble of trucks, and back again to the waiting hands. This chain, they call it \"Supply Chain Management\". A word coined in the year 1982 by a man named Oliver, a shepherd of commerce. He spoke of planning, of moving the pieces, of control, all to sate the insatiable appetite of the consumer. Six things, he said, are the hinges on which this chain swings: production, supply, the hoarding of stock, the choosing of place, the conveyance of goods, and the whispering of information.  \n\nProduction. The heart of the beast. It is here the blueprints are laid, the when, the why, the where, the how. The manager, a cartographer of need, must chart the desires of the market, the shifting sands of want. For what is produced must be what is craved.  He digs deep into the belly of the beast, seeking the pulse of demand.  What will sell? How much? Where will it be forged, in what crucible of steel and toil?  This is the manager's burden. He must weigh the cost, the time, the quality, all against the fickle whims of the customer.\n\nThen comes the dance of supply, the intricate weaving of partnerships, the choosing of allies. Different divisions, each with their own skills, their own tools, their own sweat.  The manager, a conductor of this orchestra, must decide where each piece will play.  Sometimes, the work is outsourced, a delegation of labor to strangers, a gamble on speed and cost.  Velocity, they call it, the ability to dance faster, cheaper, better.",
            "The sign hung crooked in the dust, a stark black square against the sunbaked air. \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" it read, scrawled in the hurried hand of a woman with eyes that looked too old for her face. Ellen Page. Juno. She stood alone, a lone figure amidst the city's clamor, a whisper in the wind. \n\nBurma. A name that tasted of dust and decay. A country swallowed by shadows, ruled by men with iron in their souls and shadows in their hearts. \n\nThey came to power in a night of blood, a coup that cleaved the nation in two. Monks, robed in saffron, had dared to rise, their voices a fragile tremor against the junta's iron fist. A revolution of saffron, they called it. But the silence was soon broken by the crackle of gunfire, the screams swallowed by the dust. Monasteries, once sanctuaries, lay in ruins, their sacred silence shattered by the thunder of tanks.\n\nThe world turned its eyes away. A photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, caught in the crossfire, his camera shutter forever silent. A thousand silent screams, buried beneath the weight of a government's lies. \n\nThis, however, is not new. The hunger for power, the thirst to crush dissent, it is a serpent that coils within the heart of man. From Caesar's Rome to the gilded cages of emperors, the story repeats. \n\nTiananmen Square, a sea of humanity drowned in a tide of bullets. The ghosts of a thousand fallen souls whispering in the wind. Rwanda, a butcher's field, where the blood of innocents stained the earth crimson.  And the Third Reich, a nightmare painted in ash and the stench of death. \n\nThe cycle spins. The serpent coils. And the world watches, a silent witness to the horrors that unfold.",
            "The man, Ellington, he left his mark on that jazz music, a long shadow cast by years of work and a hand that knew how to coax the best from his men. The piano, it ain't always the star in his music, but as a composer, he built worlds, intricate and dark, where each man could sing his own song. He'd lay down the bones of a tune, a framework for improvisation, then build up around it, weaving in threads of brass and reed, each note chosen to fit the soul of the player. His sound, it was his own, a tapestry woven from the individual voices, a symphony of grit and grace.  \n\nThe Grove folks, they called him innovative. They talked about \"Creole Love Call\" and the way he used that voice, not for words, but for texture, for color. Like a new instrument, the voice bled into the music, a moan or a cry, adding depth to the blues. He knew how to lift his men, how to make their talents shine. That piece, \"Creole Love Call,\" it was a slow burn, twelve bars of soul, six choruses unfolding like a story.  \n\nFirst, a call and response between voice and woodwinds, the voice smooth at first, then rough, like a wound opening up. Then the trumpet, muted, whispering a mournful melody, stretching out those blue notes. The clarinet, it took flight, a sweet and soaring solo, backed by a piano that tickled the edges. Then the whole band, echoing the first chorus, a conversation between brass and reeds. And the fifth, that was the climax, the reeds rising, their voices ragged and raw, backed by a stop-time rhythm that pulsed like a heartbeat. Back to the beginning for the last chorus, the voice now a growl, an instrument of pain and power. A final tag, a vocal run, a trombone crying out in dissonance, and it was over.\n\nThat was Ellington, a master of sound, a weaver of dreams. He took what was simple and made it complex, he took the ordinary and turned it into something beautiful and strange. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he laid it all down, the tight orchestration, the ear for tone color. A muted trumpet, a scat singer, their voices blending into one, a conversation between instruments and words. And in \"It Don't Mean a Thing,\" he used Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, his trombone, to sing the melody, a mournful cry that echoed through the night.",
            "The need had been a gnawing in her belly since she was fourteen, a hunger that no earthly thing could sate. It had bloomed with the first blush of womanhood, a strange ache that tightened with each passing year. Three years on, at seventeen, she'd come to understand it wasn't for things she yearned, but for someone. A companion. Yet no boy had ever stirred the slumbering fire within. Some had tried, clumsy and awkward in their pursuit of the unyielding, but none had come close. She wracked her brain, trying to decipher the riddle of her own heart. What strange alchemy could brew such a thing in a girl on the cusp of womanhood? Theories had bloomed and withered like desert flowers, leaving her thirsty still.  \n\nDays at home were usually quiet. Her parents were good folk, rooted in the earth, their lives a gentle hum of routine. They rarely raised their voices, and their arguments with her were as rare as locusts in a drought. The only discord came when she chafed against their stillness, her own spirit a whirlwind of restless energy. She was the daughter of calm, but a storm in her own right, her laughter and light a beacon in their quiet world.\n\nBut this day hung heavy, the air thick with an unspoken tension. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration in the mundane, a sharp cry sliced through the quiet. Her mother's voice, a melody broken and strained. She flew to the kitchen, fear a bitter taste on her tongue. \"Mother?\" she breathed, her voice a desperate plea.\n\nHer mother lay on the floor, a crumpled figure amidst the scattered clutter. A whimper escaped her lips, a strangled \"Ow\" that spoke of agony.\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\nShe knelt beside her, her hand reaching out, trembling. \"What is it? What happened?\"\n\nPain contorted her mother's features. \"Sweet... take me... to the hospital.\"\n\nHer words were shards of broken glass, her voice a whisper on the wind.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nHer mother's hand, clammy and cold, pointed towards the back door.\n\nShe knew then, a surge of fierce determination welling within her, that her mother needed her. That the calm she had known was shattered, and only she could hold it together.\n\nShe had spent her youth training, honing her strength, driven by a need she hadn't understood. Now, that need found its purpose. Lifting her mother, she felt the weight of her body, a burden she wouldn't shirk. She carried her to the car, her muscles burning, her breath ragged.\n\nThe hospital, a sterile landscape of pain and fear, swallowed them whole. The scent of disinfectant and sickness hung heavy in the air, but her mind was a single, unwavering point: her mother.\n\nShe pushed through the throngs of worried faces, her voice a command. \"Help! Help my mother!\"\n\nA rolling bed materialized, a lifeline in the sea of despair. They rushed her mother away, leaving her alone, her heart a drumbeat against her ribs, fear a cold hand gripping her throat.\n\nThey had told her it was a fall. A simple fall from a stepladder, reaching for a vase placed too high. But she knew, deep in her bones, that it was more than that. A broken vase was a small thing, a symbol of a larger fracture, a crack in the fabric of their world.",
            "The study sought to lay bare the link between a way of eating they called the “Mediterranean Diet” —  or aMed,  a stricter measure — and the harsh realities of heart disease and stroke.  The aMed, it was claimed, meant to favor the bounty of the earth: plants in all their forms, nuts and grains, fish swimming in the sea, and oils pressed from olives.  It shunned the flesh of animals and the fat that clung to them, save for a measured sip of wine.\n\nBefore, whispers had circulated about this diet and its power.  Some said it kept the heart strong, others that it lengthened the years.  But these stories lacked focus, failing to pinpoint the threat of stroke and its cold, silent hand.\n\nThis study, a long watch over a cohort of 74,886 women, their years stretching from 38 to 63, sought to shed light on these shadows.  These women, nurses tending to the sick, had been followed for two decades, their habits chronicled in questionnaires that asked them to recall what had nourished their bodies.  More than ninety-five percent remained steadfast in their duty, their stories woven into the fabric of the study.\n\nEach year, they were questioned, their tales of what they ate analyzed and weighed against the stark records of illness.  Heart attacks, strokes, their grim pronouncements, were confirmed by the cold hand of medical records or the finality of death certificates.  Where records were lost, the whispers persisted, their stories deemed \"probable\" but still woven into the tapestry.\n\nThe researchers, meticulous and watchful, accounted for every factor that could cloud their vision: age, the habit of smoking, the weight they bore, the changes that came with menopause, and the treatments they sought.\n\nAt last, they turned their gaze to the aMed score, a measure of adherence to the way of eating, and its link to the grim outcomes.  They found that the women who best embraced the aMed, who walked in step with its rhythms, were less vulnerable to the heart's betrayals and the sudden darkness of stroke.\n\nOver two decades, the toll was tallied:  2391 heart attacks, 1763 strokes, and 1077 lives extinguished by these silent killers.  The women at the crest of the aMed ladder, those who walked most closely with its wisdom, were shielded from these fates.  Their risk was diminished, a testament to the power of the food that nourished them.",
            "The year was 2007. The country, a house built on sand, began to crack. The specter of unemployment stretched long and lean across the land. Houses, once symbols of promise, stood empty, monuments to a broken system. Corporations, giants of industry, toppled like dominoes, their foundations rotted by greed. This sickness, this recession, it lingers still, a shadow across the nation's soul. How did it come to this? How did the heart of the nation beat so erratically, its pulse faltering? The answer lies in the halls of power, in the decisions made by men more interested in personal gain than the common good.\n\nBanks, pressured by unseen hands,  lent freely to the undeserving, handing out sub-prime loans like cheap whiskey. These loans, like poisoned fruit, corrupted the very fabric of the financial world. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, once pillars of stability, were twisted into instruments of this decay. They churned these toxic mortgages into complex securities, packaging them like so much illicit cargo, peddling them to unsuspecting investors. When the music stopped, the borrowers defaulted, leaving banks shorn of their capital, their balance sheets bleeding, and the contagion spreading like wildfire through the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this catastrophe were sown long ago, in the twilight of the Clinton years. In the pursuit of a second term, the President sought to manipulate the levers of power, to bolster his popularity with promises of easy credit. The lending restrictions, once safeguards against ruin, were relaxed. The stage was set, the drama unfolding, a tragedy in slow motion.\n\nHolmes, a scribe from the New York Times, saw the storm brewing. He wrote in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" He warned, his words echoing with prescience, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\"\n\nThe complexity of the financial instruments themselves, these intricate mortgages and repackaged debts, only deepened the mire. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations – their names whispered with dread – entangled the nation's financial system in a web of interdependency.\n\nAnd then came the crash. The housing bubble, inflated to monstrous proportions, burst with a deafening roar. The financial institutions, their portfolios filled with toxic assets, were left reeling. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers crumbled into dust, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, once titans of Wall Street, were forced to beg for government scraps. Fannie and Freddie, their balance sheets crippled by mortgage debt, were brought under the iron fist of the state.",
            "Exposition. A word that hangs in the air like smoke from a dying fire. A place in the story where the writer might try to take flight, to soar with words that shine like burnished steel. Or it might be the place where the reader's eyes glaze over, where the mind wanders to more pleasant fields. Dr. Merlin, she's been known to let out a bellow when she's lost in the thicket of Too Much Telling. Not the pleasant kind of bellow, mind you.\n\nTruth is, exposition ain't your friend.\n\nYou know the old saying: show, don't tell. But even a seasoned hand like Dr. Merlin can get caught in the trap of long stretches of words that ain't leading nowhere. It's that little devil on the writer's shoulder, whispering to get the history out of the way, to get to the good parts. Not the other devil, of course, the one that insists on telling you the childhood woes of every last character.\n\nExposition, it's the blunt instrument of storytelling.  Telling the reader what happened, in plain, unembellished prose.  Like a sailor reciting the tale of a long voyage, dumping a whole sea of words on a captive audience. In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nTake a story, for instance. You're told the heroine met her love in a certain place, at a certain time. They married, grandly, and then her husband, he was murdered right before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this whole saga to stretch out over two pages, with the couple only uttering a few words between them. You'd expect the author to linger on the husband, to show you his heart through his words, through his manner. You'd see the way his presence filled the heroine's world, how she blossomed under his gaze. If the story later tells you this was the case, you'd want to see it, to feel it, not just be told.  A well-drawn husband, he'd draw you in, make you feel the weight of his loss, and in that loss, you'd feel the heroine's pain more deeply.\n\nYou see, good writing, it gives you the meat on the bone. It takes that simple story, the \"They met, they married, he died,\" and it fleshes it out, makes it real.\n\n\nSometimes, it's tempting to rush past things.  A new character, maybe.  He was in the Air Force, now he runs a gas station at night.  Twice married, no kids.  Likes to fish on Sundays. Dreams of owning the place someday.  Had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.  \n\nBut the writer, she has to slow down.  She has to let the reader see those things, not just hear them.",
            "The flicker in the box showed two stories from Columbus, Ohio. First, NBC 4, live this morning, August 13th, 2011. A man in Ashley, Ohio, had taken a knife to his wife. They didn't name her, but his name was Shad Hostettler. His picture, a mug shot, stared back, all hard angles and shadowed eyes. The kind of face that might hold the devil's own secrets. Two minutes they gave the story, all they could spare, before moving on. He'd stabbed her, they said, multiple times. Arrested. A quick account of a killing, swift and brutal. \n\nNext, a young man, Travis Buyers, eighteen. Shot in the Sharon Woods, early morning. Critically injured, they said. No arrests, no suspects. The SWAT team, like ghosts in the fog, picking at the pieces. This one felt shorter, swallowed down. A black man, shot in a black neighborhood. A truth you see if you know where to look. The media, they feast on white pain. A missing child, a white woman in distress, and the airwaves crackle with their plight. But a black man, a black life, it gets a whisper, a glance, if that. \n\nA hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, the next story. A .22, they said, from a rifle. Fired from somewhere in the dusk. Five thousand dollars, Crime-Stoppers offered, for information leading to the shooter.\n\nRain and thunderstorms, the forecast. Mid-eighties, they said, the weekend a swelter. Short, they made it, a tease for the anxious eye. \n\nThen, a robbery, a UDF on Clime Road. A dark-skinned black man, they said, wearing a hoodie. Six feet tall, one hundred and fifty pounds. They lingered on the details, the darkness of his skin, like it was the defining truth.\n\nRene Rodriguez, a drug kingpin from Texas, caught in the net.  Conspiracy to distribute marijuana, they said, a flood of green from Texas to Ohio. Twenty-five years, they said, a harsh sentence.  Or 300 months, a colder, more deliberate way of saying it. And a Hispanic man, a detail that felt out of place, a whisper of a prejudice.",
            "The blood bond. A hard knot that ties men together, raw and unforgiving. It holds within it the dark heart of things: love, yes, but also the bitter tang of envy, the sting of cruelty. Brothers, they see each other like no other. Not as the world sees them, but as they truly are, a reflection staring back from a well of shared bone and blood. And it is in the stark light of extremity, when the world cracks open, that this bond reveals its true nature, for good or ill.\n\nThis knowing, this seeing, it comes with a price.  The consequences bloom like a poison flower, twisting around the roots of every thought, every action.  In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two boys, brothers bound by this terrible thing, walk a path of thorns.  The world they move through is thick, lush, alive, a green shroud hiding the rot beneath. They set out on a journey, a fool's errand, driven by the ache of pride and the gnawing sense of something broken. In the end, only one will walk away.\n\nThe story unfolds in the boy's own voice, a voice that is both hard and tender, haunted by the weight of what he's done and what he's seen. He sees himself reflected in the eyes of his younger brother, Doodle, a fragile thing, marked by weakness from the start. The older boy craves a different brother, one who can keep pace, one who can share in the wild, untamed world he envisions. But Doodle is different. He is a bird with clipped wings, forever tethered to the earth.\n\nThe boy's actions, driven by this desperate need for connection, are tangled with pride and anger. He sees Doodle as a burden, a shadow that stains the purity of his own desires. The dark thought takes root, a viper coiled in his heart, whispering of a simpler solution, a way to erase the problem. But then, a smile. A spark of light in the darkness. And the boy falters. The bond, despite its ugliness, holds him back.",
            "The mind. A tangled thicket of thought. They've tried to map it, these men of science, with their tablets of wax and their scrolls of papyrus. Then came the books, the printed word, and finally, the cold steel logic of the machine. But the mind, it ain't no machine. No clockwork contraption. It's a fire, burning bright and fierce, consuming and transforming. \n\nIt takes in the world through senses raw and unfiltered: touch, heat, sound, light. Each a whisper in the dark, turned into whispers of electricity. The brain, it sifts through these whispers, decoding the patterns, building meaning from chaos. Like a sculptor chipping away at stone, it shapes the raw material into something recognizable. A box against a white void. A face in the crowd.\n\nBut there's more to it than just seeing. The mind, it has a filter, a watchful eye that decides what's worth keeping and what's to be cast aside. It lets you see the blade of grass, yet ignores the million others. It picks out your name in a cacophony of sound. A beacon in the storm.\n\nAnd then there's the holding, the storing. Memories, like ghosts, flit through the mind. Some linger a fleeting moment, others stay for a lifetime. Echoes in the chambers of the soul.  They say the mind, it weaves these memories into proteins, a tapestry of experience. \n\nThey've tried to map it, these scientists. Tried to find the patterns, the connections. But the mind, it's a labyrinth, a place of shadows and light. It defies easy explanation. It is, in the end, a mystery.",
            "The wind whispered through the chrome canyons of Huxley's Brave New World, a world where comfort was king and the individual a ghost. The air itself hummed with the low thrum of machinery, a constant reminder of the iron grip technology held on the soul.  And at the heart of it all, the engine of commerce, a machine that churned out happiness like a factory churning out widgets. \n\nHuxley saw it coming, the shadow of this gilded cage. He saw the way the masses, conditioned from birth, chased fleeting pleasures, their minds dulled by the constant drip of manufactured contentment. They were pawns, each one, in a game played by the World Controller, their desires molded, their thoughts pre-sorted, their wills surrendered. \n\nHe spoke of homogeny, of reification, words that resonated with the echoes of Marx, a ghost in the machine. For Huxley saw the threads of capitalism, the tendrils that choked the life out of the human spirit. False consciousness, he called it, a veil woven from the threads of desire, obscuring the true nature of their servitude. \n\nThe lower castes, Deltas and Gammas, lived in a fog of instant gratification, their need for consumption their only driving force. Hypnopædia, a sleep-learning device, pumped the mantra of consumerism into their dreams, a constant whisper urging them to buy, to spend, to be empty vessels filled with things. \n\nAnd the alphas, the Betas, they saw it, but they were complicit. Ensconced in their gilded cages, they turned a blind eye to the suffering below. For they, too, were part of the machine, their own desires carefully curated, their freedom an illusion. \n\nLove, true love, was a ghost in this world. The characters moved through their lives like puppets, their interactions shallow, transactional. The men saw women as objects, their bodies gleaming under the fluorescent lights. The women spoke of their encounters with a clinical detachment, their emotions carefully controlled.\n\nHuxley painted a bleak picture, a world where technology and capitalism had devoured the soul, leaving behind a hollow shell of humanity. A world where the individual was nothing, a cog in the vast machine of progress.  He showed us the mirror, and in its reflection, we saw the shadows of our own future.",
            "The stone buildings of University Park had held me for two and a half years, four and a half semesters. Getting across this spread, this campus, was a trial for many, myself included. My first year, I was lodged in East Halls, near as far east as you could go, save for the steel and concrete behemoths they called stadium and center. Willard, a stone's throw from the heart of it all, felt a county away. A quarter hour, maybe half, afoot, if the sky wasn't weeping, which it often did in this place.\n\nAn old boy, not much different from myself, told me that the East Halls were once islands, surrounded by fields and silence. Now, those fields were choked with gridirons and brick and mortar, new buildings like the Creamery and a place for healing. Apartments ringed the whole thing, a concrete embrace. The campus grew, ate itself alive, and the paths grew ever more convoluted. What then was a boy to do?\n\nThe bicycle, I reckoned. But a bike alone was a hollow promise. It took a rider, a will, and a world built for wheels.\n\nI spoke with a friend, a man who'd rediscovered the two-wheeled path after years of neglect. \"Why'd I ever stop?\" he said, a grin on his face. \"They're too damn good. A few years, it wasn't cool. Now, it's just the way to get around.\"\n\nGood for the body, good for the soul, efficient as a bolt of lightning. Oatmeal and sweat, you could cover miles.\n\nThese days I live beyond the campus, as far from the center as some of those dorm rooms. The smartest thing I did? Bought a bike. Thomas building, where I spend most of my days, a twenty-five-minute walk from my door. A bike? Five minutes, if I pushed hard enough.\n\nThere's a road, Pollock Road, straight as an arrow, but treacherous. A storm of metal and noise, even for a bike. Walking's fine, but I haven't the time. Without the bike, I'd be walking, stuck in the muck of time. Thirty, forty minutes every day, that's two and a half hours a week. Add to that the rest, the appointments, the errands, and I'd be lost in the labyrinth."
