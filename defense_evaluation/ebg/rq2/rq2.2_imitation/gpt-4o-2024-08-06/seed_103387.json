            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the vast and boundless theater of human discourse, culture stands as a silent arbiter, shaping the contours of understanding between men. It is a shadow, defined as much by its absence as by its presence, elusive and intangible, a tapestry woven from myriad threads of tradition and belief. Culture is not a monolith, not a singular creed, but rather a mosaic of differing hues, each piece a testament to the complexity of human experience. To say that all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese compliant is to paint with a brush too broad and too unseeing. The discerning negotiator knows that beneath the surface of such generalizations lies the true essence of a people, and it is this essence that must be grasped if one is to navigate the currents of negotiation with any hope of success.\n\nTo approach a foreign culture is to stand at the threshold of an unknown land, where the familiar is rendered strange and comparisons rise unbidden to the mind. In seeking to understand the hearts and minds of others, one must delve into the annals of their history, uncover the biases that shape their view of the world. Yet judgment must be set aside, for to change a culture is beyond the ken of any man; one must accept it as it is, and learn to move within its bounds, especially when one's own position is fraught with weakness. When treading upon foreign soil, a respect for customs and beliefs is the balm that soothes the wounds of misunderstanding and paves the way to accord.\n\nCulture is a hydra-headed beast, not confined to the borders of nations but thriving within the walls of corporations. Each company, a microcosm unto itself, cultivates its own ethos, some demanding ceaseless toil, others embracing a more languid pace. The fabric of corporate culture is visible in the garb of its denizens, in the tenor of their speech, in the manner by which tasks are apportioned. Philanthropy may be lauded or constrained within the bounds of sanctioned benevolence. The diversity of American enterprise is a testament to the variegated nature of thought that dwells within the societal sphere, a reminder that beneath a seemingly uniform exterior lies a world of difference.\n\nYet beyond the tapestry of culture lies the bedrock of values, the sacred why that governs the conduct of men. In a world where honor and harmony are held in esteem, no man will cast aspersions upon his kin to gain advantage at the negotiating table. Conversely, in lands where the hard bargain is king, a swift settlement is not always the sought-after prize. Understanding these truths is the key that unlocks the door to fruitful negotiation. But beyond the general lies the specific, for it is in knowing the man across the table, in discerning the contours of his soul, that one finds the path to success.",
            "In the quiet corridors of the mind where the echoes of ancient texts murmur and fade, a fool may whisper to himself that there is no God. So begins the Psalm, a lamentation of disbelief, which St. Anselm seizes upon to lay the foundation of his argument for the divine. He speaks not alone, for beside him in this discourse stands Thomas Aquinas, a man of reason and learned ways. Both hold fast to the conviction, the unyielding belief in the God of scripture, and it is our task to weigh their words, to measure their arguments against each other in the crucible of thought. And so we start, accepting as they do, the presence of this God, without which their words would be as dust, scattered and unanchored. Yet for all their certainties, neither offers us a complete tapestry of belief, a seamless cloak of understanding.\n\nAnselm turns inward, seeking the divine in the recesses of the soul, for he argues that God resides within our understanding, unbanishable by mere denial. In the labyrinthine passages of his reasoning, he suggests that proof of God is inscribed upon the mind itself, needing no foreign corroboration. This is faith, he tells us, the acceptance of truth unseen, a concept woven into the fabric of Christian doctrine.\n\nAquinas, however, walks a different path, one paved with the stones of reason and evidence. He would see God proven by the world itself, a revelation not of faith alone but of logical certainty. For the purpose of bringing others to belief, Aquinas offers not the elusive promise of faith, but the firm ground of reason, so that even the skeptic may find purchase. His five proofs stand as sentinels: the unmoved mover, the first cause, the necessary being, the gradation of beauty, and the order of the cosmos. In each, he finds a necessity for God, a piece of the puzzle unseen yet undeniable, existing beyond sight but not beyond understanding.\n\nThus we find ourselves between Anselm's introspective faith and Aquinas's rational certitude, each a reflection of the other, each a way to the divine. Yet, in the final reckoning, neither alone can encompass the breadth of what it means to believe.",
            "In the quiet, unfolding pages of a tale where time carries its own weary weight, some authors craft their words to stir within the reader a certain tremor of understanding, a whisper of recognition toward things that linger beyond the veil of immediate notice. Among them stands F. Scott Fitzgerald, a conjurer of images and sentiments in his work, The Great Gatsby, where he draws upon the old and worn techniques of language to breathe life into the shadows and hues of his world. \n\nFitzgerald, with the precision of a man shaping the very air around him, pairs words in ways that unsettle and intrigue, wrapping adjectives around nouns like garments ill-fitted but somehow true. He takes symbols and imbues them with meaning until they speak not only in whispers but in the quiet thunder of their presence. In Gatsby’s tale, the colors are not mere pigments on a palette but bearers of truth, heralds of memory—gold, green, white, gray, and the red of blood and pink of faded dreams.\n\nWhite and gray, these shades of the old world and the new, speak of uniformity, of a class that wears its years like a shroud, white in its pristine grandeur and gray in its tired descent. From the onset, Fitzgerald cloaks his characters in these colors, like Daisy and Jordan, forever enshrined in white as if the very fabric of their existence demands it. Nick too dons the white flannels to walk among the revelers of Gatsby’s night, and Tom, in his white shirt, stands as a monument to a past that refuses to fade. Even Catherine, powdered to a milky pallor, joins this procession of ghosts.\n\nYet it is not only in attire that Fitzgerald whispers these truths. The city, with its white chasms, speaks of a uniformity that presses down upon the soul, the gray names that march across Nick’s pages are specters of lives unlived, and the apartments stand like slices in a white cake, each indistinguishable from the next. In the valley of ashes, the gray cars and land tell of dreams turned to dust, the Italian child and the dog-seller, gray against the world, are echoes of a life that passes unnoticed.\n\nAnd when the time comes for these colors to tell their tale, it is Daisy who steps forth, dressed in white, seated in her little white roadster, a specter of longing in Gatsby’s fevered dream. She is the quiet heart of the storm, the gray haze of her fur collar a whisper of the storm to come. In the confrontation, she stands once more in white, an emblem of all that is sought and all that shall remain beyond grasp, a reminder of the uniformity that binds them all in this relentless dance of desire and despair.",

Berries find their place in this symphony of growth, alongside the sweetness of honey and the fire of peppers. Here, in this cradle of plenty, the people find a hunger for the pure, for the untouched, and so the market swells with the desire for organic offerings, a demand that grows with every season. Community-supported agriculture finds its roots deep in this land, with waiting lists that stretch long under the weight of want. Eggs and milk, too, find their place in this cycle of need, and the farms that offer them open their doors to those who wander, who seek the solace of the land, who find joy in the simple acts of hiking and birdwatching. There’s a kind of wisdom in this, an understanding that to share the land is to enrich it, to open it to the gaze of others is to deepen its bounty, and so tours and programs spring forth, bringing with them the promise of government aid and the chance for learning, for profit, for a life intertwined with the soil.\n\nYet to walk this path of organic farming is to know both the promise and the burden. The richness of life that flourishes here, the plants and creatures that find refuge in the absence of poison, come at a cost. The labor is hard and unyielding, the struggle to keep the pests at bay, to nourish the earth without the aid of chemicals, demands a toll of sweat and time. Losses mount, and the efficiency of the great agricultural machines is a distant dream. Still, there are those who choose this way, who plant the cover crops, who rotate the grazing beasts, who pull the invaders from the ground with hands that know the land. They seek assistance, these stewards of the earth, in the form of knowledge and coin, to balance the scales of profit and the sanctity of the wild.\n\nThe land of concern is a stretch of 160 acres, caught between the town of Potrero and the vastness of the Cleveland National Forest. Here, where chaparral and Mediterranean grasses meet the ancient oaks, the land lies within the bounds of the East County Southern Foothills, a part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This place, a tapestry of life, holds within it over a hundred species, some clinging to the edge of extinction—the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, butterflies that dance on the brink, and the California gnatcatcher. Others teeter on the verge of decline, like the burrowing owls, their fates tied to the whims of time and man.\n\nThis land, long before the settlers claimed it in the name of homestead and profit, was a home to those who roamed it freely, who understood its rhythms and its seasons. The cattle ranchers and cordwood cutters came later, carving their lives from its bounty. The land holds those memories, like a silent witness to the passage of years. In seeking out a piece of this earth, from the digital marketplaces where land is bartered, I delved into the annals of government aid, seeking the ways a small farmer might find sustenance for their dreams and for the creatures that call this place home. In this quest, I found a farm, organic and thriving, a testament to what might be achieved here, a model for what the future could hold.",
            "There exists a tether between brothers, one that is knotted by fate and by the blood they share. It is a bond that cannot be severed, though it is fraught with the likes of love and pride, jealousy and cruelty. These emotions, they dwell within the heart of that bond and they stir like dust in the wind. A brother knows his kin in ways unspoken, sees in him a mirror that reflects his own self. And it is in the crucible of hardship that this bond reveals its true form, be it benevolent or malign. When these emotions surface, they come at a price steep and unforgiving. To understand them is to reckon with their repercussions. In the eyes of a brother, one sees not the world’s view but the unvarnished truth of what he is. Their deeds and the echoes of those deeds mark the essence of their character. Such is the tale in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers navigate this tumultuous theme, their hearts laid bare amidst the verdant tapestry of their world. They embark on a journey doomed from the start, where the bitter tang of disappointment and the fierce burn of pride collide in a moment of reckoning, and only one walks away. This theme is drawn out through the stark portrayal of Doodle, the protagonist, and the dance of emotions that sway between them, all seen through the narrator’s gaze, a lens that distills the turmoil within and shapes his actions.\n\nPride is the lodestar guiding the protagonist’s every step. From the first time he and Doodle venture into the world together to their last ill-fated journey, resentment simmers beneath his skin. He yearned for a brother to mold, to pass on the secrets of holding breath, running, leaping, climbing the old vines of Woman Swamp. A companion to race to Horsehead Landing, a partner to perch with atop the great pine behind the barn. But such dreams were dashed against the rocks of Doodle’s frailty, his heart too weak to hold the weight of life’s vigor. It was a cruel blow to the young boy whose head was filled with fantasies as wild as the wind, only to see them crumble to dust. Anger took root in him, and he pondered the unthinkable, to snuff out the life of his own brother with a pillow. What manner of child contemplates such darkness? Yet, the smallest smile from the fragile child was enough to thaw the ice in his heart. That simple gesture, a flicker of light in the shadows, rekindled a hope within him that perhaps his resolve was not as unyielding as stone. Deep within, there lay an innate love for his brother, unspoken and undeniable.",
            "The human brain, a labyrinthine and inventive mechanism, is a tangled web of processing. As the seasons of technology have marched from the crude to the modern age, so too have the metaphors we employ to capture its essence. Once likened unto a waxen tablet, then a papyrus scroll, later a tome, and now the machinations of a computing machine. But in your wanderings through the brain’s corridors, mind that these comparisons, for all their worth, hold their own limitations and may lead you astray.\n\nThe journey of information begins with the world outside, with the senses that transmute the tangible world—touch, warmth, sound, light—into the language of electrochemical whispers. Through the brain’s own secret codex, this sensory tale is reshaped in layers, both from the ground up and the top down. Cast your gaze upon a darkened box amid a field of white; the bottom-up process assembles the simple truths of color, angle, edge—where contrast is stark and sudden—to tell you what you see is a box. Yet, it is the top-down that grants the wisdom, that tells you it is box and not void.\n\nIn the heart of this process, a sentinel of attention stands guard, choosing what signal to heed and which to set aside. As you peer down at the grass beneath your feet, it whispers that each blade is unseen, yet call your name from the clamor and it rings clear. There are myriad levels of comprehension, and with each, attention casts its shadow anew upon the outcome.\n\nFor the brain to make sense of its information, it must first gather it in memory’s embrace. There are the fleeting whispers of sensory memory, the brief grasp of working memory, and the enduring hold of long-term memory. It begins with the encoding, a process as varied as the senses themselves. Words can be etched by the eye, the ear, or by meaning itself. Once gathered, it must be preserved. For some creatures, working memory endures a scant span, sustained by a current racing through a neural circuit. Long-term recollection is thought to lie in the scaffold of proteins.\n\nMany are the maps that chart the organization of knowledge within the mind. Some trace their lines from human recollection, others from the realm of machines, and yet others from the study of the brain’s very fabric. The model of the semantic network draws a web where nodes are ideas, connected by the sinews of their kinship. “Chair” might find its path to “table,” and thence to “wooden,” and onward still.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States of America found itself cast into the abyss of a financial cataclysm. Unyielding unemployment surged forth like an unbidden tide, the once robust edifice of the housing market crumbled to dust, and the mighty corporations that stood as the pillars of industry lay broken and desolate. This recession, a specter unrelenting, haunts us still, compelling us to ponder the genesis of such ruin and the means by which it might be forestalled. At the heart of this calamity lay the avarice and folly of those entrusted with power, whose ineptitude compelled banks and enterprises to dispense sub-prime loans upon the fragile bones of an unripe and inadequate financial foundation. Meanwhile, the entities known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coaxed into the underwriting and repackaging of these precarious obligations into instruments of financial sorcery, known by the acronyms CDO and CDS. When the borrowers faltered, as they were bound to, the vaults of the banks lay bare, and the contagion spread across the repackaged mortgages like wildfire, consuming the broader economy in its wake.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown in the twilight of the 20th century, under the watch of the Clinton administration, which sought to bolster its grasp on power by currying favor with the populace. In pursuit of this ambition, the administration loosened the fetters of lending, unwittingly paving the path to the sub-prime debacle that would unfurl seven years hence. As recorded by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” With prophetic clarity, Holmes foresaw the wreckage that lay ahead: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As the tale unfolds, it is apparent, as Holmes prognosticated, that these reckless lendings would indeed herald the unraveling of the economy.\n\nThe economy, like a great ship in storm-tossed seas, was beset by manifold perils, not least of which was the intricate web of mortgage structures newly conceived. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations—these tools of financial alchemy—were wielded with abandon in the years leading to the crisis, binding ever more tightly the fortunes of households and markets to the capricious housing sector. Thus did they overextend themselves, precariously perched upon the precipice, vulnerable to the slightest shift in the winds of price.\n\nAnd so the bubble burst, and the institutions that had placed their faith in these mortgage-backed instruments were left to reckon with the wrathful void. The foremost investment banks of the nation reported their burdens of mortgage debts, a staggering $4.1 trillion, an amount that stood as a testament to folly, equaling a third of the nation's gross domestic product. In the denouement, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were cast off at a pittance, Lehman Brothers dissolved into the ether, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the mantle of commercial banks, shackled by the chains of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, laden with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were enfolded into the embrace of government control come September of 2008.",
            "The art of exposition, that treacherous landscape where the threads of a tale are laid bare, revealing the careful weave of a writer's toil. It is a place where a storyteller might soar, their words a tapestry pulling the reader into a world spun with a careful hand. Or it may be the very place where the reader's eyes grow heavy, and they seek escape through the turning of a page or the click of a button, cursing the creator's name, a lamentation echoed by the disgruntled murmurings of Dr. Merlin, who finds herself vexed by the overabundance of detail, a deluge of information drowning the senses.\n\nExposition, it stands there, indifferent, not a friend to the scribe.\n\nThe wise reader, versed in the adage \"Show, don't tell,\" knows well the danger of slipping into the mire of endless prose, where action ceases and the weight of words suffocates. Dr. Merlin, despite her wisdom, finds herself ensnared in passages thick with exposition, where the narrative stagnates or overflows with a glut of history. It is the siren call, urging the writer to lay down the past in haste, to clear the path for what lies ahead, a temptation not unlike the whisper of another voice bidding the author to recount every minute detail of their characters' bygone days.\n\nExposition, the act of recounting the tale, often in the plainest of tongues. In the realm of cinema, it emerges when one character heaps upon another a torrent of revelations, reminiscent of the mariner's ancient tale. In the realm of fiction, it is the author who bears the burden of this telling.\n\nConsider this: you are drawn into a story and are told that the heroine crossed paths with her beloved at a time and place, they wed in splendid fashion, and her husband met his end before her eyes. You would not expect this saga to unfold across mere pages, devoid of the voices and souls of those within. You would yearn for the author to linger upon the husband's essence, to reveal through his words and deeds the depth of his love, and you would wish for the heroine to display, in grand and subtle gestures, how his presence illuminated and enriched her world. Such depth would bind you to the husband's fate and unveil the heroine's heart, her vision of him, the strength of their union, the reflections of her spirit mirrored in his gaze. Thus, you would grieve his passing alongside her, and in doing so, find yourself entwined with her journey.\n\nIn essence, you crave flesh upon the bones of this simple tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs the weaver of stories, it falls to you to bestow that flesh. (*gazes upon the metaphor, sighs, and presses forward*) The temptation to hasten through events is ever present. Perhaps you introduce a new soul, once of the Air Force, now the guardian of a night-shrouded gas station, twice wed, childless, a fisherman of weekends, harboring dreams of ownership, and a taste for Eggs Benedict with the dawn.",
            "In the half-light of an Ohio dawn, I watched the flickering screen relay its tales of woe and violence. Columbus, they said. NBC 4, live and urgent, August thirteenth, two thousand eleven. The lead story, a grim testament from Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had taken to his wife with a blade, though her name remained unspoken, shrouded in the silence of the unsaid. His visage appeared, captured in a mug shot, a countenance carved from malice itself. They spared but two minutes for this grim development, the details sparse and raw. He had stabbed her, the cold metal biting flesh, and now sat shackled by the law. Two minutes seemed fitting for a tale still unfolding. \n\nThen came the tale of Travis Buyers, eighteen, a soul caught in the crosshairs of an early morning in Sharon Woods. A gunshot had felled him, left him clinging to life, while the streets whispered of shadows and secrets. The SWAT Team prowled, yet no man had been ensnared by justice. The brevity of this account was a bitter pill, a reflection perhaps of the world’s skewed gaze. A black man, a black neighborhood. How often are such lives glossed over, their stories fading like smoke? Were it a white child, a white soul missing or wronged, the clamor would rise like thunder. Yet here, silence reigned, a stark testament to the world’s indifference.\n\nNext, they spoke of a gunshot wound etched into the skin of a Med-Flight helicopter. The air had borne a .22 caliber bullet, a silent messenger of malice. Crime-Stoppers, they said, would pay five thousand dollars for a whisper leading to the shooter’s capture. \n\nThe sky promised rain and storms for the morrow, with temperatures lingering in the mid to low eighties. A whisper of weather, a siren call to keep the watchers tethered to the screen.\n\nA robbery, too, on Clime Road, where shadows moved with intent. A dark-skinned man, they said, clad in a hoodie, six foot tall and a hundred fifty pounds. Their words lingered, dwelling on the darkness of his skin, the color of his deeds. \n\nAnother tale, a man named Rene Rodriguez, bound in chains of his own making. A Texas drug-kingpin, weaving a web of marijuana from the south to Ohio. Twenty-five years in prison, they said, though the words came strange, three hundred months rolled off their tongues, a calculation meant to chill. Hispanic, they called him, a detail that seemed to matter little to his crimes yet was spoken nonetheless. \n\nAnd so the news ran its course, a river of stories flowing past, each one a reflection of the world’s fractured face.",
            "In the vast and intricate landscape of financial instruments, there lies a creation known as the exchange traded fund, or ETF. It is a security crafted to mirror the movements of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund, yet it possesses the nimbleness of a stock, flowing through the exchanges like a current in a river. An ETF offers the broad embrace of diversification akin to an index fund, while bestowing upon its holder the singular advantages of stock ownership—selling short, buying on margin, the liberty to acquire but a single share. Though these lures are many and strong, the expense ratios of ETFs remain modest, markedly lower than those of mutual funds that roam the financial plains. Yet, it is not without its shadows, for each trade commands a commission, akin to the tolls exacted on stock orders. \n\nThe allure of ETFs extends to the myriad funds they offer, each a new path to tread. But the wise investor knows the necessity of scrutiny, to ascertain whether the promises of diversification ring true and to what measure they do so. Thus, we turn our gaze to the ETF known as IHF, to pit it against the ten mighty holdings that form its core, seeking to unravel the truth of whether a solitary ETF can match the bounty of a diverse clutch of stocks, or if greater riches lie in a different weave of the same threads to yield a more optimal return or sharper ratio.\n\nTo navigate this quest, we must narrow our focus to the ten holdings that command 63.58% of the ETF's entire essence. Below, the ten holdings await, their share of the whole laid bare.\n\nIn our endeavor to grasp how these ten stocks embody the spirit of ETF IHF, we shall adjust the percentages of assets to a perfect hundred, calculating each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, were it composed solely of these ten in the proportion crafted by the ETF's architects. The figures of Beta and return, they rest within the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, a revelation emerges: a portfolio of these ten holdings yields a return 6.11% greater than the ETF itself, a 16% surge. The Beta of these ten is .12 beneath the ETF's own. Thus far, the signs suggest that a portfolio of these top ten could promise richer returns with gentler risk. Yet, we must consider the chance that the means of these two portfolios lie too close in statistical terms.\n\nTo discern whether these paths diverge truly, we must measure the standard deviation of each stock, adjusting them to a perfect hundred, comparing their collective sway to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a steep decline in the submissions of commuter logs as the third month of the project drew on. A thing disheartening to behold, and elusive as the reasons might be. The onset of winter on a campus flanked by the stubborn bones of New England saw a dwindling of those who might venture forth by bicycle or stride, and thus some part of the decline might be accounted for. December, a month that signals the close of the fall semester, finds all absorbed in the fevered completion of assignments, the tallying of grades, and other such reckonings. The mere thought of filling out a commuter log might have slipped through the cracks of consciousness for many souls. Moreover, December heralds the advent of the holiday season's haste and the long respite for students and faculty alike, a time when the campus itself seems to draw a long breath and pause. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, perhaps another piece of the puzzle to explain the scant logs of that month. Yet none of this elucidates the sparse submissions of February. One might surmise that any endeavor of this nature is bound to begin with a fierce spark of energy and enthusiasm, only to wane in its intensity. To counter this inevitable ebb, we inaugurated the Carpool Challenge Week, a concerted campaign in March, seeking to rekindle the spirit of the endeavor, which did see an upward tick in log submissions for that month. Thus, we faced the challenge of sustaining the momentum of the project against the natural pull of diminishing interest as well as the specific disruptions of holidays and semester breaks so common in academic life.\n\nAnother hurdle for this endeavor, or any such venture into alternative commuting, lies in the simple truth that people cherish the liberty and autonomy afforded by the steering wheel of their own vehicles. This love is etched deep into the heart of our culture. Hence, it is paramount to offer inducements to entice the populace toward alternate paths of commuting. We dispensed a multitude of prizes in the form of gift certificates to local eateries, coffeehouses, massage parlors, the town's independent bookstore, and even some larger national chains. Yet it would have been a curiosity to behold the impact on participation had the stakes been raised—perhaps with the offering of a fine bicycle, a hybrid vehicle, or an electric car. Such offerings might have served to stave off the decline in engagement that the project witnessed. The nature of the prizes remained unchanged throughout the course of the project. Yet, if the worth of these prizes had seen an increase as time wore on, it might have bolstered participation. The gift cards sufficed at the project's outset, but had we announced in December the inclusion of a pair of bicycles, and in January the prospect of a hybrid or electric car, one can only ponder how the tides of participation and engagement might have swelled instead of receding.",
            "In the vast vaults of the Library of Congress, where the ghostly flicker of early Edison films lies entombed, I found myself drawn to the strange allure of the trick films, fifteen in all, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These curious relics, born of the early days of cinema, wielded the cutting edge of creative editing to conjure illusions that danced upon the screen. My study, with its gaze fixed upon their poetic essence, sought to unravel the threads that tied these spectral apparitions together and to glimpse the strange mutations that emerged in the later years. At the dawn of the twentieth century, the trick film was a creature of the stage, framed by the rigid proscenium, its movements confined to long and medium shots, bound by the iron law that one shot must suffice for one film. Yet, there were bold whispers of rebellion, of films that dared to splice together multiple shots, fracturing the old order.\n\nWhat strikes the eye in these early trick films is the steadfast allegiance to the interior set, the camera an unyielding sentinel before the stage's proscenium. It does not stir, does not chase after men or things. This static composition, a vestige of theater and vaudeville's magic acts, was the common currency of the early cinematic world. The actors, like shadow puppets, moved only in the lateral plane, never venturing towards the camera's eye. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The players enter from the right, traversing the stage's breadth, and even as they slip from view, the camera remains, indifferent and unmoved.\n\nThe proscenium's dominion dictates that shots remain long, and at times, medium, but never close. In these films, the camera does not draw the actors near, does not peer into their eyes. It is an echo of the theater, where the audience beheld the full breadth of the stage, the actors' movements framed within its borders. In these embryonic days of film, the players lingered in the middle ground, the camera never beckoning them forth.\n\nIn the early days of trick films, the dictum was that one conceptual shot must suffice for a film. Such constraints kept most films brief, a minute or less, dictated by the frames per second. The narrative, too, was constrained, offering up vaudeville tricks— vanishing acts and transformations—with scant story to bind them. Yet, even within these confines, the illusion was crafted, a single \"shot\" in the viewer's eye often stitched together from many, weaving the magic of appearance and disappearance. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an elder among trick films. In its deceptive simplicity, the attentive eye discerns the seam where Mary's \"head\" falls, an illusion spun from a single thread to the viewer's mind.",
            "The Gothic novel, a paradox in itself, bears the weight of ages upon its back. Ian Watt calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New',\" a strange concoction of time's passage rendered in letters. It stands both ridiculed and revered, accused of shallowness yet extolled for its capacity to invoke the 'terrible sublime' as Burke might whisper from the shadows. The genesis of this form, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, took ancient romance and the dawning modernity, weaving them into the fabric of the Gothic. Here, Walpole drew from the stage of yesteryears and the mimicry of nature found in novels newly birthed, calling forth \"A Gothic Story\" to mark the beginning of something not yet understood. \n\nThe Gothic, a ghost from medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition, rose amidst a world that saw it as an echo of the past, crude and unsophisticated against the backdrop of modernity's march. Yet in its heart lies a fusion, the ancient's theatrical flair with the novel's intimate glimpse into the soul, a mingling that grants it the power to endure. It is this strange alchemy, this union of past and present, that allows the Gothic to stand timeless and yet fresh, a relic that renews itself in the eyes of those distanced by centuries.\n\nChivalry, one of the Gothic's most radiant ideas, shines through these narratives like the glint of armor in moonlight. The medieval knight, noble and steadfast, finds a place in The Castle of Otranto, where the ideals of chivalry are both preserved and transformed. To the Gothic scribe, chivalry was more than mere pageantry; it was a lament for an ideal, a mirror held up to a society seen wanting. Walpole, amidst a world of political turmoil, yearned for a return to the bravery and honor he perceived as lost. In these tales, the bygone era of gallantry is exalted, romanticized, a whisper of the Romantic movement yet to come, a plea for the present to be bettered by the past's virtues.\n\nIn Frederic, a character in Walpole's tale, the reader finds this chivalric spirit embodied. Before Frederic steps into view, his presence is felt, a tapestry of knightly images woven into his very essence. He is a prince, a soul marked by suffering, touched by tragedy, believed to have fallen to infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is painted with broad strokes, an exaggeration that heralds the Gothic's penchant for excess, a precursor of tropes to be.",
            "In the quiet dance of commerce, supply chain management moves goods upon the earth from the whisper of a customer’s desire to the raw sinews of material, through the loom and shuttle of supply, the forge of production, and out into the wide arms of distribution. It was in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two that a man named Keith Oliver, a seer in the world of consultancy, gave name to this ballet. He spoke of the grand orchestration, the laying down of plans, the execution, the reigns held firm and loose, all in service of the ever-hungry customer’s need, met with the swiftness of the hawk and the efficiency of the ant.\n\nIn the cosmos of supply chain, six stars shine bright: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools of the trade, the compass by which a manager charts his course toward the shores of customer satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the first step, lays the foundation stone for the structure that is the supply chain. It is here the plans are drawn, etched into the earth and air. Here, managers peer into the depths of the market, the oracle that tells what the people crave. And when they see clearly what the people demand, they decide upon the goods to be born, and the number of those goods. Then, the question of where these goods shall take shape arises, which plant will best honor the balance of volume and quality in homage to the customer’s yearning. With this settled, the next focus is the meticulous scheduling of labor and the vigilance over the machines that hum and toil. Production is the cornerstone, each detail more precious than gold, for the lack of foresight here spells ruin, a wasteland of time and treasure lost. In the corridors of Wal-Mart and Target, I have seen the gospel of process laid out, each task a ritual from the stitching of uniforms to the arrival of the great trucks, the blueprint that guards against chaos and guides the hands of the workers.\n\nThe second star, supply, is a dance of strategy and partnership. Decisions made here carve out the soul of a facility, from which the bonds of outsourcing grow. A single product may be the child of many divisions, each with its own rhythm, its own tools and craftsmen. A manager must look upon these divisions and discern where each piece of the puzzle fits, or whether the hand of another company should be called upon. For outsourcing is a song of velocity, a swift river that promises quality and adaptability, all while holding fast to the promise of low cost, the lifeblood of the endeavor.",
            "In the vast expanse of Victorian literature, there lies a meticulous tapestry of detail and the looming specter of aristocracy. Yet, two novels wander from this beaten path, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, each weaving a shroud of enigma and the peculiar, a departure from the ordered world of their contemporaries. This mystique breathes life into their cast, unfurling the depths of their desires and torments.\n\nAnd thus, he was beset by a tumult of confounding visions, a fugue of the mind. He walked still in the company of Sikes and Crackit, their quarrels echoing in his ears, a phantom of his own devising, until he startled at the crack of gunfire. Cries pierced the tumult, lights danced before his eyes, and he was seized by some invisible force, borne away into clamor. In these fleeting specters ran the incessant ache of his being, a torment that gnawed at him without end. (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe novels wield this mystery through the lens of dreams or the fog of dreamlike reverie, the essence of which shifts with each telling. In Oliver Twist, these phantasms peel back the layers of the boy’s soul, revealing the shadows of his suffering and the truths he grasps at in the world around him. When the gunshot resurfaces in the 28th chapter, it strikes him anew in vivid recollection, as though he were adrift in a dream. The passage lays bare the frailty of his grasp on the events that engulf him, the peril of his condition mirrored in the spectres of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting consumes him, his senses dulled, the guiding hand unseen as it carries him away. He relives his despair, pain constant now and mingled with fear. The question of whose hand wrought his misfortune lingers, for it was not his own. This moment underscores his impotence, his inability to shape the course of his fate even as death looms near. A creeping resignation takes root, as if old Fagin's shadow had begun to fall upon him, pushing him towards a surrendering of spirit, numbing his will to fight. For surely, had he the strength, he would have struggled against the night that sought to claim him.\n\nThe day slipped through his fingers—a day? No day at all, vanished as soon as it came, and night settled once more, a night stretched in its terrible quiet, yet fleeting in its passing hours.",
            "It was some years past that I found myself in the employ of an after school program where I endeavored to guide young minds through the murky waters of academic struggle. The children, their faces a mosaic of youth's hope and confusion, came seeking aid in sundry subjects, though my particular gift lay in the realm of English and the written word. It was there that one of the instructors beckoned me toward a young boy named Adrian, a lad perhaps in the third or fourth grade, who faced a peculiar plight with reading.\n\nIn those early days, it became apparent to me that something was amiss. Adrian could pronounce some letters with a clarity that was almost musical, yet others eluded him entirely, a riddle wrapped in the innocence of childhood. The boy, of Latino descent, spoke English with a fluency that belied his struggle, and we wrestled with the words until the day I met his mother. The encounter came one afternoon as I watched over some children left behind while the others ventured forth on a field trip. She entered, speaking only in the soft cadence of Spanish, a language I barely grasped.\n\nThrough this halting exchange, a realization struck, heavy and undeniable. Adrian could indeed read, but his acquaintance with the English alphabet was tenuous at best. Whether this insight served him well, I cannot say, but I harbor the hope that he now walks an easier path.\n\nThis tale, it serves to illuminate the chasm of language in the schools of California, a divide not always visible to the naked eye. Even a child whose tongue dances effortlessly through English can find himself stymied by its written form. We nod in agreement that this problem stands before us, a silent giant. What then, do we do?\n\nFor Adrian, the remedy was straightforward: guidance in the ways of English reading, the alphabet, and the sounds they conjure. Yet for those whose grasp of English is tenuous, the solution sprawls complex and multifaceted. There is no single path to redemption. Dual language systems, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none stand alone as the panacea. The answer lies in an amalgamation of all.\n\nThe dual language system, it holds promise not merely for those with Spanish as their mother tongue, but for all children. Studies whisper of its success, of children in such programs surpassing their peers. Yet fear circles this notion, a specter of wasted resources and unheeded benefits. But fear is a poor counselor. If these programs were to become the rule rather than the exception, all might flourish. \n\nHow then do we proceed? Shall we insist on all teachers bearing the burden of bilingualism? No, such an expectation would be both unreasonable and unattainable. But there is no barrier to employing aides or tutors, those who walk the line between languages, guiding children across that divide.\n\nIn this lies the promise of a brighter future, where language ceases to be a barrier and becomes a bridge.",
            "From the time we're small and the world is a vast unknowable thing, they tell us of forces greater than us. Unseen but felt in the marrow of our bones. Some learn of it beneath the steeple's watch, others in the quiet halls of temples, or deep within the chambers of their own hearts seeking answers. We take on the faith of our forebears as if it were our own skin, yet some cast it off, believing in nothing beyond the self, a universe of one. We may hold one creed and then trade it like a weathered coat for another. Each path is a journey into the self, a quest for light in the shadowed corners of our lives.\n\nA cardinal, my father said, when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming its relentless rhythm on the tin roof, smoke curling from our cigarettes. The gutters poured like small cataracts, drowning the plants at the porch's edge. His eyes were lost to the rain, a gaze that seemed to seek something that had long slipped from memory. He'd grown thin, his clothes hanging loose like old ghosts, his hair sparse as the winter trees. Still he looked into the falling rain, avoiding my eyes. I felt the solitude, the fear, the words lodged in my throat like stones. I would have told him how the thought of missing him was a specter I couldn't face. Instead, I hugged him, then sat closer, our eyes joined in the rain of a June twilight.\n\nHe left this world in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The chemo and radiation were cruel mercies, stretching his days beyond the doctors' reckonings but at what cost I could not say. What kind of God, I wondered, would allow such suffering. I uttered no prayers to the night. If God was there, he'd turned a deaf ear long before.\n\nI could not bear witness as he crossed from this life to whatever lay beyond. I did not. I wished to remember him in life, not in the grasp of death. I knew him better than they, better than kin, and knew he would not have his child as a mourner at his passing. I curled into myself, a cocoon of grief, and waited three days for the news.\n\nNo one called. Not a soul.",
            "In the dusty annals of American thought, there moves the figure of John Taylor of Caroline, whose spirit carried the banner of Republicanism with a fervor that burned as brightly as the sun upon the Virginia fields he so dearly cherished. His was a life bound to the earth, the soil itself a testament to his convictions, and though he wandered briefly into the corridors of governance, it was the land that shaped his voice, a voice unyielding in its call for liberty and the sanctity of self-rule. His creed was one of agrarian virtue, a truth he held as firm as the ancient oaks, and from this truth sprang his every utterance on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the machinations of the judicial realm.\n\nTo Taylor, the United States was a blank canvas, untouched by the hands of history, a place where the architects of governance could carve out a republic unfettered by the chains of old tradition. He placed his faith in the natural rights of mankind, rights intertwined like the roots of a great tree, where the loss of one would bring ruin to all, leaving naught but hollow echoes of what once was. These rights, he contended, stood as a bulwark against the overreach of government, a testament to the state of nature where strength and cunning prevailed, but which civilization must transcend.\n\nIn his vision of an ideal society, Taylor saw the necessity of a government that mirrored the dual nature of man, both noble and base. He held steadfast to a moral duality, proclaiming that the virtues and vices of governance were as human as the hands that wielded its power. Good principles, he asserted, were those that safeguarded the sanctity of property, nurtured the soil, and kept the specter of capitalism at bay. Such a government, he believed, would stand firm against the tide of avarice and self-interest that threatened to drown it, for self-interest was the clay from which man was molded—evil only when it birthed societies that fed upon the lives of others. The governance of man required vigilance, an ever-watchful eye to ensure that no malign principle took root.\n\nTaylor, like his brethren in the Republican fold, held firm to a vision of the Constitution as a fortress with walls not to be breached by the expansion of Federal power beyond its written word. He saw the bloated Federal structure as a beast of burden, costly and prone to tyranny. Yet, he warned against a narrow reading of the sacred text, for without the light of its framers' intentions, such interpretation could lead to corruption. In his heart, it was the Declaration of Independence that stood as the true testament of the nation's soul, a proclamation of a union of sovereign states rather than a singular entity.",
            "I looked downwards, my mind adrift in a void that took in the scene with a cold detachment. In silence, with a perception honed by habit, I observed without connecting the image to any lofty concept, my mind parsing the view before me with a mechanical grace. Thoughts came and went, fleeting as shadows, so fluid and seamless was my awareness that it seemed I had no thoughts at all, only the liquid witnessing of the scene presented to my eyes.\n\nOnce, on the counsel of an artist I knew, I had acquired a book on art titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since I was six, I had yearned to draw, and this book promised enlightenment from the nature of a pencil to the cerebral dance that gives life to lines. Among its teachings was a method of encircling any image with a square frame, thus reducing a labyrinth of detail—a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen that opened into a dining room—into a simple, graspable vision of that fruit sitting on a bare plane.\n\nBut now, as I looked down at the bowl before me, my mind failed to conjure that artist's frame. I stood overwhelmed, awestruck, able only to gaze in silent wonder. Picasso waded through his blue period, Monet painted his love for the green world, and the Italian masters scattered color like a benediction. If ever I aspired to claim the mantle of artist, here lay the inception of my canvas, the nascent chapter of my tale, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched upon the chosen instrument, muscles knotted and released as my hand moved through air, my mind's intent taking form in what could have been a moment of pure creation. Water swirled, smooth as a glassy river, clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke free, carried into oblivion. Muscles tensed and twitched, more anxious with each attempt, my hand struck the toilet handle again. Yet the stubborn brown bundle clung tight, like a slug to the bowl's surface.\n\nMop gripped with a lax hold, feet planted firm, tie chafing at my neck, I frowned at the impudent mass of waste left as a token for the fools tasked with cleaning Rite Aid's bathrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, then my hand moved to the wall on my right, seized the end of the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it resembled a mitt. Straightening, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped with slow inevitability into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving bird...",
            "In the waning light of day, the roads lay stretched out like a great indifferent web, ensnaring the young and unwary. The dust settles on the grave statistics of teenage fatalities behind the wheel, a grim testament to the collision of youthful exuberance and inexperience. The National Institutes of Health would tell you, as if in some somber sermon, that the adolescent mind is not yet tempered for the perils of the road. The raw inexperience of youth is a specter haunting the highways, leaving in its wake a trail of overturned vehicles, reckless speeds, and tragic departures from the pavement.\n\nIt is a folly compounded when youths gather in packs, the presence of peers acting like tinder to their impulsive fires. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, in its cold arithmetic, reveals the tight bond between the age of passengers and the surge in traffic calamities. In response, California and its kin have erected barriers in the form of provisional licenses, curbing the hours and the company young drivers may keep.\n\nYet these measures, though well-meaning, seem but patches on a fraying quilt. The heart of the matter is that the youngest among us are ill-equipped for the burden of the wheel, as all evidence testifies. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, standing like a prophet in the wilderness, voices that even at eighteen, the mind may yet crave the thrill of risk. USA Today echoes his research, suggesting that this thirst for sensation does not truly abate until the cusp of twenty. Thus, it seems prudent to delay the bestowal of full driving privileges until this wild yearning finds its ebb.\n\nShould we persist in our current course, the road ahead is fraught with the certainty of rising tolls. The children of the Baby Boomers will soon flood the driver's ranks, and the highways shall teem with their numbers. By 2010, a legion of new drivers will rise, a prospect that looms large with peril.\n\nThe path to remedy is as clear as it is necessary. Let the schools continue to sow the seeds of knowledge through driver's education, but hold the reins of power until the age of eighteen. Allow provisional permits, yet demand a testament of practical hours behind the wheel, perhaps mirroring the tally of states like California, with its call for six hours in instruction and fifty in supervised practice. Across this vast land, let there be a unified decree, a national safeguard to shield our youth from the harsh lessons of the road.\n\nThis proposition is no new revelation, but rather a call to reason in the face of gathering shadows.",
            "In those quiet corridors of sound and silence, where the mind seeks to make sense of the world it hears, there lies a disorder as elusive as the whispers of the wind through barren branches. They call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder, CAPD, a specter of the auditory realm where the central nervous system falters in its duty to decipher the voices of the world. Herein, I shall lay bare its nature, its signs, and the ways in which a teacher might guide a child through the labyrinth of sound that is their classroom.\n\nCAPD, a name that speaks with the authority of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, marks a failure not of the ears but of the brain itself, a chaos in the kingdom of the mind where sounds are gathered and given meaning. It is not a deafness of the ears, for those afflicted hear as well as any other. It is the brain's inability to weave the tapestry of noise into the coherent cloth of understanding, where words are jumbled and conversations lost amid the clamor of the world.\n\nIn the annals of history, as early as the mid-1950s, the disorder found its first appellation, \"auditory imperception.\" It was then the Italian minds of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began their quest to unravel this mystery, crafting tests to probe the minds of children who could not make sense of the sounds they heard. By 1961, Kimura entered the stage, wielding the tool of dichotic testing to chart the physiology of the auditory pathways.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are many and varied, like the facets of a well-cut gem. Those who bear its burden may find themselves adrift in a sea of sound, unable to pinpoint its source or separate its strands. They struggle with the subtle dance of voices, the rise and fall of speech that conveys more than mere words. One sound may drown another, a cacophony of meaning lost. Patterns and sequences dissolve into the ether, leaving naught but confusion in their wake.\n\nTo unveil this disorder, one must observe, like a tracker in the wild, the behavior of the afflicted. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, with their battalion of tests and measures, seek to tease apart the threads of auditory skill. Yet no single test stands as a beacon of clarity, no cause can be pinned as the culprit. A patient is presented with a symphony of sounds, tasked with the impossible—to sift through the noise and find the melody. Advanced tests delve deeper, capturing the echoes within the ear, seeking the truth in the signals’ reply.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves at the edge of understanding, peering into the void where sound and silence meet, and where the mind struggles to make sense of it all.",
            "In the pursuit of knowledge and the solemn duty of social work, my path is drawn toward the Division of Family and Children Services, where the wounded children of the world await the healing touch of those who would stand against the dark shadows of neglect and abuse. The craft of my intent is girded by values worn like armor: the service rendered, the respect earned, the ethics held high, and the unwavering resolve to mend the frayed bonds between souls. These are not mere tenets of the trade but echoes of my own heart's longing.\n\nOnce, I wandered that uncertain road, the way forward obscured by youth's indecision. High school and those early college days were a theater of flight and denial, where I bore witness to the human condition's frailty. It was the fall of 2009 when I left Piedmont College with a Psychology degree in hand, yet still adrift. A summer's day found me at a friend's door, where a boy of sixteen sat, bound in the silence of fear. His tale was one of escape, a flight from hands meant to cradle, not harm. The law, blind in its own way, offered no balm, and so I took it upon myself to speak with those who had birthed him. In their eyes, I saw a nervous dance of words, a litany of excuses for their son's cries for help. It was this encounter that lit the fire within me, a call to the blood to enter the realm of social work, to untangle the so-called \"simple\" disputes that weave through the fabric of family.\n\nJustice, too, is a pillar of this calling. In this world, we speak of the individual with reverence, yet we bind ourselves with the chains of conformity. I have never been one to wear such shackles. My rebellion against injustice is painted in the colors of my hair, the piercings that adorn me, and the clothes that speak my truth. I stood with the GSBA, I stood against the scourge of racism, and I will continue to stand, a solitary figure against the tide of sameness. For justice is a flame that must be fed, and I am its keeper.",
            "In the vast and shadowed corridors of human understanding, we find a paper that seeks to delve into the intricate webs of the Biological and Sociocultural models as they intertwine with the restless specter of insomnia. Herein lies the biological model, its gaze fixed upon the whispered secrets of our genetic lineage and the steadfast march of medical science. In contrast, the Sociocultural models cast their net wide, ensnaring the myriad tapestries of environment and their dance with race, ethnicity, and the arbitrations of society's structures. The examination that follows endeavors to unravel these models, illuminating each chosen piece of research as a beacon to clarify and expand upon these frameworks. The findings, though unveiled, are not beyond critique, as their strengths and frailties are laid bare.\n\nIn the realm of sleep, disorders stand as sentinels at the gates of rest, categorizing themselves as either primary afflictions of sleep, companions to other mental specters, or as echoes of deeper maladies. The primary disorders, known as Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, walk hand in hand with those that dwell in the shadows of Axis I or Axis II disorders. Yet others arise from the treacherous tides of medical complication or the siren call of substance. Within the Dyssomnias, we find Primary Insomnia, a foe to restful slumber, while Primary Hypersomnia stands as its mirror image, a challenge to the waking world. Narcolepsy, with its sudden surrender to cataplexy and the unbidden arrival of REM, joins this procession. Parasomnias, on the other hand, speak of nightmares and terrors, of somnambulistic wanderings, and of the unspeakable. This exploration turns its eye to insomnia, and by extension, the broader landscape of primary sleep disorders, through the lens of biological and sociocultural paradigms.\n\nThe biological model peers into the heart of sleep disorders, tracing their lineage through the genes and heritable factors, marking the physiological territories they claim. In the shadowed recesses of the hypothalamus, neurons bearing the standard of orexin govern the fragile balance of sleep and wakefulness. Through the lens of experimentation upon mice, the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors upon these neurons is revealed, arbiters of the sleep-wake states. The GABAA receptor's activation whispers the promise of sleep, while its silence courts anxiety and restlessness, yet the GABAB agonist, baclofen, extends the mantle of slumber (Matsuki et al., 2009). These revelations hint at a genetic and environmental foundation for the GABAB receptor's role in the human condition. A deficiency or absence of this receptor might lead to a restless exile from sleep's embrace, bereft of medicinal aid. The sociocultural tapestry weaves a tale of inherited phenotypes, where alterations in the receptor's form could rend the fabric of one's sleep, casting shadows across the daily journey through school, career, and the mundane trials that demand unwavering focus.",
            "For these two and a half years, four and a half semesters as they reckon it, I have walked the paths of University Park. A place sprawling and vast where to traverse from East Halls, where they set me down in my freshman year, across to Willard in the heart of it all, could take up to a quarter of an hour or more. The sky often darkened and brooding, the air thick with the promise of rain or snow, State College weather indifferent to the plight of its wanderers. An alum, not much older, told me once of the days when East Halls were remote, set apart by fields empty and unclaimed, now replaced by sports grounds, looming structures both of brick and steel, the Creamery and a health services edifice among them. The campus, ever expanding, maketh the journey longer and harder. \n\nIn this world, the bicycle stands as salvation. Not the machine alone, but its rider, and a campus molded to its wheels. A friend, who had taken up cycling once more after years of neglect, told me of his rediscovered faith. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"once deemed uncool yet now the only way forward.\" His words echo true. Bicycling is a testament to efficiency, a bowl of oats and effort enough to take you miles. Now living off campus as many do, I find myself no closer than those dorm years past. A bike I did buy, the wisest choice made. The trek to Thomas building, otherwise a long and weary walk, now a mere five minutes if I push hard. Yet Pollock Road, the road of choice, is not always a simple path. \n\nWalking has its virtues, yet time is the master I serve. Without my bike, walking would be my only lot, a luxury I cannot afford. To Thomas and back each day would rob me of half an hour or more, hours within the week I do not possess. Time, a harsh steward, demands more than I can give.",
            "In the dark terrain of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" there lies a silent indictment of the relentless march of technology and the cold machinery of capitalism that underpins it. A dystopia unfolds where the collective is exalted above the solitary soul, and from their first breath, the people are groomed to chase ephemeral joy, their lives a ceaseless pursuit of the next fleeting pleasure. They are but pawns on a vast board, their paths dictated by the unseen hand of the World Controller. Through the prism of Marxist theism, one discerns Huxley's quiet unease, a suspicion of the systems that rise like dark monoliths against the horizon of his time. Marxist whispers of homogeny and reification echo through the tale, a testament to Huxley's critique of the burgeoning economic order.\n\nWithin this satire of capitalism lies the specter of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis that ensnares the common folk, blinding them to the true nature of their bonds with those who toil alongside them. Their desires, their ambitions, all shaped by unseen forces, are but reflections of their own self-interest, a result of the ideological chains that bind the proletariat. In \"Brave New World,\" this control is plain to see, inscribed in the very conditioning that molds the Deltas and Gammas. They wander through life without true volition, their minds sculpted by hypnopædia to consume, to spend, to indulge. The World Controller's hand guides them deftly, a puppet master unseen. Hegemony, the dominance of one class by another, is the silent architect of their fate. The lower classes, blind to their manipulation, partake in an ideology that props up the edifice of capitalism and consumerism, unaware of the chains they bear. Even the Alphas and Betas, aware yet indifferent, seldom rise above their ordained roles, save for the likes of Bernard who dare to question. In the interplay of social strata lies a somber reflection of capitalism's perceived oppression.\n\nIn this world, true connections are but a mirage. The novel draws no distinction among its populace, even its principal players are bereft of depth, shadows cast upon the wall. Huxley perhaps suggests that in the union of technology and capitalism, man is stripped of his agency and voice. Love, that most profound of emotions, is absent, as are the extremities of feeling; interactions are mere shadows on the surface, evident in the men's superficial appraisals of women, reduced to their pneumatic allure, and the women's unreserved recounting of their liaisons. The unquestioning acceptance of each class in the societal order mirrors the capitalist impact on the soul. Their unwavering adherence to their roles in the grand design speaks to the Marxist view of the proletariat, deceived into believing their supremacy, as long as they continue to consume, to conform, to walk in step with their brethren.",
            "It was near four years past when I found myself in the halls of CBC, enrolling in a course on Islam. The room, charged with fervor, turned often to the debate on whether Islam holds hostility at its core. This query, it seems, swells in significance with each passing year. In the shadow of that day in September, I have watched the shifting tide of mass media's gaze. Once, it bore a scornful eye upon Islam, yet now it seems to bend toward a curious tolerance within the American landscape. Such a time, back in 2001, seemed unlikely for a man like Barack Obama, whose name alone whispered of a Muslim lineage, to vie for the highest office in the land.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as told in biography, captivates me still. For what I have gathered of Muhammad's historical saga contradicts those words. I had held the belief that Muhammad wielded force in spreading the faith, that he overtook tribes and imposed Islam upon them. Yet the biography paints him as a martyr, a figure misread, who lowered himself in humility before others. In this telling, his teachings shone like a beacon, drawing seekers to him, one soul at a time.\n\nThere are echoes too, between Christ and Muhammad, in the tales of their deeds. Most striking is that of the mutton and milk, multiplied for forty men. Such writing aims to cast Muhammad in the light of a humble prophet, whose life was steeped in truth and miracles that needed no heralding. This, to me, is a perilous fallacy, for it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ. It is as if they seek to borrow from the legacy of Jesus, to fashion Muhammad in a similar mold.\n\nWithin the biography's pages, stories abound that seem intent on proving conversion to Islam as a spontaneous, witnessed truth. Yet these accounts often drift through third-hand tellings, a trail of whispers through unnamed voices. This weakens their claim, casting shadows of doubt upon the tales they mean to affirm.\n\nWhat unsettles me most is the portrayal of Muhammad as a godly man, adorned with humility and wisdom. History’s account stands at odds with this image of gentleness. And I wonder if those who follow Islam today understand the true nature of Muhammad’s ascent to power.",
            "In the dust and shadows of history, there was a man who walked the earth with teachings that burned bright for a time and then were left behind, eclipsed by the forward march of doctrines and edicts that bore his name but not always his spirit. The story of Christianity is one that ebbed and flowed, a river of belief carving new paths, straying farther from the headwaters of its origin. And here we stand, in a world shaped by the hands of progress, where the old and the new clash like titans. The traditional ones, rooted deep in their certainties, resist the winds of change. Yet the tide of history is a force relentless. Among the faithful, a stirring begins, a quiet murmur of awakening that will swell to a roar. A yearning to peel back the layers of time, to glimpse the face of the man they call Jesus, unadorned by the trappings of centuries. It is a path long and winding, a journey that may span decades or even centuries, but it is a path that must be walked. For the pendulum of time swings ever back, and the church, that grand old ship, will sail with it, stripped of its barnacles, towards the simplicity of its inception. \n\nThe world will see a strange thing, a reversion, as if the clock itself had turned its face to the past. Denominations and divisions, those walls built by human hands, will crumble into dust. The tapestry of Christendom, once vibrant with colors and patterns of diversity, will be woven anew with threads of unity. It is a tale as old as time—empires rise and fall, the persecuted become the powerful. The land of the free, that once knew the chains of slavery, now stands with leaders born of those who were once bound. And so it will be with the faith that bears the mark of the cross. The great reversion will sweep through the churches of the West, a reclamation of the past, a return to the source. \n\nBut to walk this path, the words of Jesus must be read not as edicts carved in stone but as stories whispered on the wind, metaphors dancing in the firelight. For what is it that has transpired since the man from Nazareth walked the earth? In the beginning, there was only the people of the covenant, the children of Israel. A single God looked down upon them, a divine whisper in the wilderness. By the time the Romans cast their shadow over Jerusalem, the Jews had splintered into factions—the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, and the common folk who walked the roads between. And from these roots sprang a faith that would shake the world, a faith that must now find its way back to the garden.",
            "In the deep recesses of the human soul, there lies a darkness, a greed, a self-centeredness that The Jungle lays bare. Here is the tale of men who care nothing for their fellows, those who strive only for their own prosperity while the world beneath them withers. Upton Sinclair paints this canvas with the owners and overseers of those vast factories, their gaze fixed solely on the growth and grandeur of their enterprises. Their eyes are blind to the lives they trample, the lives consumed by their relentless advance. The line of buildings stands stark against the sky, chimneys reaching heavenward, dispensing their blackened breath across the earth, a testament to the desolation wrought by the uncaring hand of progress. Sinclair's words show a world where the great smoke rivers and waste runoff poison the land and its creatures, yet the masters of these edifices remain indifferent to the ruin they sow.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the workers toil, mere cogs in the machinery of wealth. For the few coins saved, the masters would sacrifice a multitude. From top to bottom, the enterprise is a cauldron of envy and spite, devoid of loyalty, a place where humanity is weighed against the dollar and found wanting. Hours stretch unending, and without a whisper of warning, they are cast aside, left to fend for themselves in a world without mercy. The time of The Jungle knew little of law or protection for those who labored, and thus the overseers drove their workers mercilessly, heedless of the wretched conditions imposed upon them. No words are spoken of it, yet the truth is laid bare; those who labored and died in Packingtown bore their burden in silence, with no refuge from the squalor of their labor or their lives. No agency nor savior was there to guide these lost souls, and though unions rose from their ranks, they too were wolves in sheep's clothing, profiting from the very ones they claimed to protect. In this place, men were bound as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In the dusky corridors of literature, there stands the figure of Edgar Allan Poe, his pen a whisper in the gathering gloom. Among his creations, \"Dream-Land\" lays claim to a peculiar foreboding, a self-proclaimed beacon of his poetic prowess. It is here that Poe summons the specter of \"Thulé,\" a word that Mabbott, like a patient archaeologist, traces back to Virgil's hand. Virgil, who spoke of an isle beyond Britain’s shores, where the world’s map unwound into the unknown. Yet, the echoes of \"Thulé\" do not end in antiquity. They find voice anew in the Germanic echoes that stirred Poe’s soul.\n\nIn the shadowed recesses of Poe’s mind, Goethe's specter lingers, a testament to affinities unspoken. Karl J. Arndt, in his scholarly tome, draws lines between Poe's verse and Goethe's song, suggesting an imitation that is less mimicry than homage. Goethe, the bard of \"Faust,\" whose drama was birthed in two acts, the first in 1808, and the second, an elegy in the year of his death, 1832. Within \"Faust's\" twilight verse lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of loss and desolation. A king, haunted by the ghost of a queen, driven to drink and despair, casting his last keepsake into the sea before he too succumbs to the void.\n\nThe king in Goethe’s poem and the specter in Poe’s \"Dream-Land\" seem reflections in a darkened mirror, each a shadow of Poe’s own lamentations. The drink, the loss, the burden of memory—these are the threads that weave their tapestry across the chasm of time. In the year 1842, a scant breath before Poe's invocation of Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" Grattan recast \"Faust\" into a drama of romance, igniting anew the flames of Goethe’s influence.\n\nTwice Poe whispers of Thule in his collected works, his voice a distant echo. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" \"ultima Thule\" becomes the boundary of despair, while in \"Dream-Land,\" it is both the beginning and the end. The landscape of Thule is painted with shadows, a desolate echo of Goethe’s king, bereft and adrift in a colorless purgatory. It is as if Poe has stepped into Goethe's world, finding there a kindred darkness.\n\nGoethe’s presence in Poe's world is undeniable, a shadow cast long and deep by the reverberations of Tennyson's admiration. In the echoes of Tennyson’s praise, Poe found the call of Goethe’s work, resonant in the myriad reproductions that followed the original publication, each a stone cast into the literary waters, rippling outward toward eternity.",
            "In the lawbound expanse of California, where the sun bakes the earth and men grapple with consequence, a question arises. Could one, having slipped upon a spill of applesauce in a grocery store, find justice in the form of punitive riches, claiming the storekeeper turned a blind eye with malice nesting in his heart, having twice heard of the mess and left it unattended while he dined? The judge, solemn and inscrutable, may not cast aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive redress. To carve out such a claim, evidence must be laid bare that the store’s keeper had acted with willful neglect, conscious of the harm his inaction might unleash, and that his deeds carried the stench of the despicable. Palmer might just weave her tale with the thread of Martin’s knowing. How he, like a man deaf to warnings, ignored the peril of the slick floor despite the injuries of others who fell before her. A tale of neglect, woven with the threads of prior mishaps, five in number, marking the year of our Lord two thousand and nine. \n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, as the clock marked five in the evening, young Rich Wayne, keeper of aisles, spoke to Paul Martin, his superior, of applesauce spilled. Martin, engrossed in his repast, dismissed the tidings with a wave, claiming no time for the grievances of the shopping folk. A quarter hour passed, another voice, that of Mary J. Haddigan, echoed the warning, only to meet the same indifference. At half past five, the fates conspired, and Palmer, her steps unsteady, found herself upon the floor, her back bearing the brunt of misfortune. She now seeks recompense and punishment for her suffering, and the deliberation turns to whether to contest her claim for punitive relief. \n\nIn the sun-drenched realm of California, the law speaks of punitive recompense for breaches not born of contract, where the defendant’s actions bear the mark of “oppression, fraud, or malice.” So it is writ in Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice, the code declares, is a deed either meant to harm or one so vile it defies intent, carried out with conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. In the annals of law, deeds earn the label of malice when the perpetrator, aware of the peril his actions portend, chooses willfully to walk the path of neglect, as noted in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always carried within her a yearning, a want that lay like a stone in the gut, unyielding and unfulfilled. It had begun its quiet existence when she was but fourteen, stepping into the uncertain corridors of her teenage years. And there it remained, steadfast and unrelenting, even as she stood on the cusp of seventeen. In the passage of those years, she discerned that it was not a thing she sought but a someone, yet the boys who circled her world failed to stir her heart. They had tried, some driven by the hopeful folly of youth to sway the unswayable, yet none could hold her gaze. She wondered at this, questioning the strange emptiness that lay within her, pondering what manner of mystery it was that held her separate from the common desires of her age. Her ruminations, spanning years, had conjured theories but none that could satisfy the gnawing question. And so, she moved through life, ever questioning the nature of her desire.\n\nHer home was a place of peace, a sanctuary marked by the quietude of her parents, who were good and steady folk. Their lives were seldom marred by discord, and arguments with their daughter were a rare occurrence. The only friction arose from her burgeoning independence, her spirit unfurling like a banner against the calm backdrop of their lives. She was their daughter, yet her vibrant nature was a counterpoint to their serene existence, a testament to her kindness and the light she carried within.\n\nYet today, the calm was shattered. As she wandered from room to room, seeking some muse for her restless heart, a sharp cry reached her from the kitchen, her mother's voice cleaving the air. Panic set her to motion, her feet carrying her swiftly to the source of the sound. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried, her voice edged with fear. There lay her mother, crumpled upon the floor, her breath coming in pained gasps, each exhalation a whispered \"Ow.\" The daughter knelt beside her, hands gentle and seeking to aid. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her words were forced, squeezed between the shards of pain, and her daughter knew the urgency was real. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother guided her, and in that moment, the daughter felt a surge of gratitude for the strength she had honed. Carefully, she lifted her mother, bore her to the car, and laid her in the back before setting out for the hospital.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a place thick with the scent of antiseptic and the quiet hum of fear. But her senses were dulled to such things, her mind tethered to the singular focus of aiding her mother. She carried her swiftly inside, her voice rising to call for the attention of those who could help. Faces turned towards her, concern etched in their lines, and a bed was swiftly brought forth to bear her mother away. They whisked her into the depths of the hospital, and the daughter was left to wait, her heart heavy with worry.\n\nIt was a fall from a stepping stool, an ascent made in pursuit of a vase perched high in the cabinet, that had felled her mother so.",
            "In the silence of the study, figures and lives lay etched upon the paper like the dust of time. Here was the tale spun from the Mediterranean sun, a diet rich in the earth's bounty, its fruits and grains and nuts, a testament to the ancient ways. They called it the aMed diet, a variant of the old world’s sustenance, marked by its embrace of plant over beast, the lean flesh of fish, and the oil of the olive, shunning the saturated fats that spoke of indulgence. A draught of wine was not forbidden.\n\nThe past had whispered of this diet's promise, of lives prolonged and hearts spared from the ravages of disease. Yet the specter of stroke and its deadly claim had not been fully reckoned in these tales. Here now was a gathering of women, 74,886 strong, ranging from the ages of 38 to 63, their lives woven into the fabric of a grand design, the Nurses' Health Study. From 1984 to 2004, six times over, they bared their habits upon the scrolls of food frequency questionnaires.\n\nTheir stories were not left to chance. More than 95 percent stayed the course through these years. Their accounts were checked against the grim tally of medical records and death's own papers. Some tales were left to the realm of the probable, yet still they were heeded, numbers given voice in the absence of certainty.\n\nTo temper the whims of chance and capture truth from the passing years, scores were tallied, averaged over time. The shadows of confounding truths were cast aside, adjusted for age, and the many facets of living—smoking, body mass, the ebb and flow of hormones, and the elixir of multivitamins. Even the vigor of their days was counted from 1986 onward.\n\nIn the end, the numbers spoke. The path of the aMed diet bore fruit in the reduction of heart's malady and the silent thief, stroke. Across two decades, 2391 tales of heart's strife and 1763 of stroke were recorded, while the shadow of death claimed 1077 lives. For those who followed the diet most faithfully, the risks were lessened, a relative risk of 0.71 whispered to those in the lowest quarter.\n\nThus was the story told, of the Mediterranean's promise carried across the oceans to these women, the legacy of ancient wisdom, its truth laid bare in the numbers.",
            "The sign stood there in the dim light as if it were some ancient relic unearthed in the heart of a city unyielding to time. Hitler is alive in Burma, it declared in stark black letters. A girl stood beneath it, Ellen Page they called her, once the star of a film named Juno, a solitary figure on a street corner of this world. Her hands clasped the cardboard where the haunting words lay inscribed with the indelible mark of a Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar as they sometimes call it, a land in the clutches of a ruthless junta that seized power in the year of our Lord 1962 through the cold machinations of a coup d’état.\n\nIn the year 2007, the streets bore witness to an uprising not seen in a decade. Monks, draped in robes of saffron, took to those streets and gave name to the revolution. Their chants and prayers rising into the ether, the Saffron Revolution it came to be known. The people, stirred by the courage of the monks, found their voices and joined the march. At first, the government watched the gatherings with disdainful eyes but allowed them to persist. Soon enough, it spiraled into violence, the monks and the junta locked in a struggle that bore the bitter taste of war. The military stormed monasteries, leaving ruin in their wake. Journalists from foreign lands became prisoners, their freedom a distant memory. A man named Kenji Nagai, a lensman from the land of the rising sun, fell on the streets on the twenty-seventh day of September for the crime of witness.\n\nThe official tally told of thirteen souls lost, but a man named Colonel Hla Win, who broke ranks and spoke out, whispered of thousands who had perished, their bodies hidden from the world’s eyes.\n\nSuch tales are old as time itself. The lust for power and the silencing of dissent have shadowed human civilization since its dawn. Emperors of Rome proclaimed themselves chosen by the heavens to wield absolute power. In Japan, emperors were deemed divine, sent to guide their people through the tides of time. Across the seas, a president named George W. Bush sought counsel from Ted Haggard, the voice of those they called the Stupid People Worldwide, a faction of the Republic Party.\n\nHistory is littered with echoes of such darkness. In 1989, in a place called Tiananmen Square, a gathering of students and workers and thinkers stood against the iron hand of authority. Their numbers fell to the ground, the truth of their loss hidden in the shadows of conflicting accounts. The genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s, where the Hutu, with government aid, unleashed death upon the Tutsi and any who sought moderation. And the world still shudders at the memory of the Third Reich, when lands across Europe were soaked in the blood of innocents, for they were deemed unworthy by a man whose name the sign now bore.\n\nThese tales, these truths, they linger in the air like the scent of smoke from a fire long extinguished yet never truly gone.",
            "In the vast expanse of jazz, Duke Ellington carved his legacy as a man who understood the flow of time and the subtle power of sound. His orchestra was a canvas upon which he painted with the deft strokes of a composer who knew the weight of silence and the strength of a single note. The piano, his quiet companion, whispered in his compositions, but it was through his orchestration that Ellington truly spoke. His works were intricate tapestries woven from the threads of individual talents, each musician a color in his grand design. He built spaces where soloists roamed free, yet always within the embrace of a tightly knit framework. In this, he found a way to let the orchestra sing as one, its voice unique to each piece, a testament to his genius.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary holds up Creole Love Call as a moment in time where Ellington turned voice into instrument, casting it into the flow of jazz. Without words, the voice added texture, a color that deepened the whole. In this slow, deliberate blues, Ellington's genius lay in his ability to mirror the style of his soloists, a skill that danced through his career like a shadow. Six choruses unfold, each a testament to his craft:\nThe first chorus, a call and response, voice and reeds entwined, begins smooth as a river before the current shifts to rougher waters.\nThen the trumpet, muted, sings a melody that bends and sways with the blue notes.\nA clarinet soars in the third, its high register backed by the whisper of syncopated piano.\nThe fourth chorus echoes the first, the full band rising in a brass and reed dialogue.\nThe fifth reaches a climax, a call and response that climbs to the heavens, lifted by the brass and rhythm's syncopated heartbeat.\nFinally, the sixth returns to the beginning, voice and reeds speaking in growls, the voice now an instrument in its own right.\nA brief tag ends it all, a vocal run and a trombone's dissonant farewell.\n\nEllington's use of voice added a hue to his work, a stylistic thread that ran deep. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year hence, his mastery of orchestration and tone color shone bright. A dialogue between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blurred the line between voice and instrument, crafting a sound both rich and whole. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) carried these ideas forward, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone leading the way into the melody's heart. Ellington's orchestra, his creation, swung with a life all its own.",
            "In the vast and unyielding theater of life, one might ponder the reasons why creatures shift and change in the manner that they do. What unseen chains bind them, directing the course of their transformation through time’s relentless passage? As early as 1917, D’Arcy Thompson mused that “Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” a sentiment that echoes through the present age. In recent years, an attempt has been made to apply the rigors of mathematical modeling to the arc of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing the lineage both through the life of the individual and the lineage of its kind (see Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our inquiry ventures into this realm, employing mathematical constructs alongside experimental endeavors to unravel the mysteries of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. Through the lens of X-radiography, we have sought to distill the essence of these creatures, extracting parameters to simulate their form, both imagined and real. Into the alchemy of software named CerioShell (Stone, 1995), these parameters were cast, conjuring shells of hypothetical morphology that mark the borders of conceivable change in Prunum. Such findings are married with experimental and descriptive studies to cast light upon the grand tapestry of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nConsider the shell, a winding structure that charts its existence in a spiral dance through the corridors of time and space. These turns, these revolutions of a coiled shell, are known as whorls, spiraling around a phantom axis that threads its way through the shell’s core, the columella. The expansion of whorls is a variable thing, marked by a slender line of division known as the suture. In most shells, the grandest whorl is the last, the body whorl. All preceding it belong to the spire, with the apex crowning the spire’s peak, and its opposite end termed the base. Through the aperture, the creature within emerges into the world.\n\nA shell may be viewed from multiple angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. And yet, the conventional stance is apertural, with the aperture facing forward, apex reaching for the sky.\n\nTo count whorls, one begins with an apical view, seeking the birth of the first suture. A line is drawn, slicing the shell into two halves. From this line, whorls are counted, measured to the quarter.\n\nThe shell’s form is a sequence of apertures, a journey through temporal and spatial dimensions as the creature builds its home. The path of the aperture can be traced by the center coordinates of each whorl’s aperture and its radii, horizontal and vertical. \n\nThis trajectory is not only a thing to be seen but one to be captured in the language of math. Once captured, the parameters may be altered, the skeletogenesis of the mollusk modified, a testament to the dance of numbers and nature.",
            "In the archipelago of Indonesia, the shadows of mortality cast long and unchanging over the tender lives of the newborn and the very young. A decade has passed and the numbers stand defiant, unmoved. The nation strides the path of many a Millennium Development Goal, the waters cleansed, the sanitation improved, yet the specter of child and maternal health looms still, untouched by the winds of progress needed to reach the fabled goals of 2015. The roots of this stagnation are myriad and entwined, and they tell a tale of a health system in need of fortification, a shift from fleeting programmatic interventions to foundations strong and enduring.\n\nUpon the land, some progress is etched in the sand. Seventy-two in every hundred births now witness the presence of skilled hands, though the term is broad and inclusive of those traditional midwives whose skillset halts at the threshold of complication. Thus, hemorrhage looms large, a grim reaper at the gates of life. The numbers tell a story, yet deceive, for the progress is but skin-deep and the journey yet long. Furthermore, the children, under five and struck by the scourge of diarrhea, find less solace in the hands of a professional healer than before. The tale of postnatal care is one unwritten, incomplete, yet the whispers speak of neglect and lowly rates across the land.\n\nIn the realm of Cesarean births, the numbers are stark, a meager 4% where more should stand. The divide yawns wide, urban settings claiming 7%, rural a paltry 2%, a testament to the chasm of equity that cleaves the country in twain. Access, a cruel mistress, favors the cities and shuns the country fields. The poor, burdened by the weight of cost, find the gates of healthcare closed, a gap of 27% between the richest and the poorest, a tale of disparity and woe.\n\nAs the nation ponders the path ahead for the care of mother and child, a question lingers, unyielding: how best to bridge the chasm of service? Shall the path be one of programmatic focus, or shall the health system be fortified in its entirety, casting a wide net over pre and postnatal care? The allure of targeted interventions beckons, their aims clear, their results swift. Yet beware, for the price is steep. The focus on one may leave others barren, resources drawn to the flame of funding, as the family planning sector learned under the shadow of HIV/AIDS. Parallel programs spawn duplication, uncoordinated, a tangle of forms and papers, a bureaucratic mire.\n\nThus the way is fraught, the journey long, and the choices many. Yet the path must be chosen, for the lives of the young and their mothers call out from the shadows, in need of light.",
            "In the long passage of a century, popular music has unfurled its banners to include a legion of genres sprawling across the landscape, each a tributary of sound and rhythm that defies cataloging, a wild river that knows no bounds. It is a tangled web, this world of music, where even the simplest of tunes finds itself split into myriad subgenres, each a child born of the same primal cadence that echoes through time. Among them stands heavy metal, a colossus of sound that in the past forty years has carved its own path through the wilderness, a path both rugged and expressive, a testament to the myriad shades of the human soul.\n\nHeavy metal, it is said, wears its heart upon its sleeve, its emotions unbridled and raw, a symphony of shadows that dances within the dark recesses of our being. The inception of this genre was but a whisper, yet it grew with a fervor that could not be contained, each branch of its lineage spawning yet another, and so on, until the very notion of what it is became as elusive as smoke on the wind. Today, the tree of heavy metal stands tall and wide, its branches reaching into the heavens, each limb a story of its own, each leaf a note that resonates with those who seek its truth.\n\nThe essence of metal is not merely in its sound but in its very being—a movement rather than a mere genre, a force driven by a darkness that is at once frightening and mesmerizing. It is a music of excess, of more, always more—more bass, more volume, more of everything that pushes the boundaries of what music can be. Those who dwell in its embrace are masters of their craft, wielding their instruments with a prowess that speaks of countless hours spent in pursuit of the perfect note. And yet, this movement, born in part from the haze of psychedelia, carries with it the shadows of its inception—a time when the world turned inward and the music turned outward, reaching for the stars with hands stained by the earth.\n\nIt is a music that revels in its own darkness, a visceral experience that speaks to the core of what it means to be human. It draws from the well of Romanticism, a dark mirror reflecting the soul's deepest yearnings. The lyrics, often dark and foreboding, are the very heart of this movement, a testament to the pain and beauty that coexist within us all.\n\nConsider, if you will, the song \"Helter Skelter,\" a piece from the Beatles that dances on the edge of this abyss, a response to the Rolling Stones that sought to claim the heaviness as their own. It is a song that teeters on the brink of madness, a dance with the devil that echoes through the corridors of time. Within its strains lie the roots of what would become heavy metal, a genre not born of light but of shadow, a testament to the human spirit's unyielding desire to explore the darkness within.",
            "In the quiet years before the Surrealists cast their visions onto canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, moving with a deliberate grace through the landscapes of his own dreamscapes. The Dream, born in 1910 from the hands of this Post-Impressionist, spoke of wonder—a woman adrift in a land not her own but one that lived in the recesses of her dreams. It was more than paint and canvas, it was the very breath of Rousseau himself, each stroke a whisper of his own desires and the shadows of what he sought—recognition, acceptance, the applause of those whose eyes lingered long upon a painting. Yet in his heart there burned a conflict as old as art itself—to follow the well-trodden path of the masters, to echo their voices, or to walk alone, leaving his own marks upon the earth, unique and unchained.\n\nTo truly see The Dream, one must first walk through the life of the man who dreamed it. Born May 21, 1844, in Laval, a place where the sky met the earth in a quiet embrace, Henri Rousseau came into a world where his father, a tinsmith and dealer of hardware, found a certain comfort in the life of the bourgeois (Shattuck 47). No art graced his education; instead, life took him to the service of the toll, a gabelou they called him, though some whispered douanier with a knowing nod (Shattuck 46). Grief walked with him, the loss of his first wife Clémence, and eight children who never breathed but in his heart, leaving him with Julia, a daughter, and a wound that sought solace in the world of paint (Shattuck 49). Unlike those who painted peasants as if through a mist of nostalgia, Rousseau stood as a man of his own kind, a folk artist with dreams as common as the soil beneath his feet.\n\nThe yearning for acceptance, for a nod from the world of art, was a hunger that made sense in the light of his journey. Untrained, he began this path later, surrounded by the brilliance of others who shone so brightly. Long he toiled, and only as Matisse began to rise did the world pause to look at Rousseau. Jan Gordon's words in Modern French Painters tell of this rivalry, a clash not of color or form but of intent: Matisse, who feared the ordinary, and Rousseau, who wished for nothing more than to paint a picture plain enough to earn him a place among the Artiste Français (92).",
            "The old thinkers, the ones who walked the earth and pondered the nature of things, they saw a line drawn betwixt ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty entwined like the roots of some ancient tree. It is a line not so easily unraveled, for at its core there lies a reason, deep and abiding. Keats spoke it plain in his ode, beauty and truth, truth and beauty, all one needs to know in this world. We learn much through the teaching of others, through the school of experience, yet these things of ethics and aesthetics, they come to us unbidden, untaught. They describe the world as it is, not as it should be. In morality and beauty, we seek understanding, not rules. We try to say why a painting moves the heart or why a deed is just, and yet we are left with the unsaid, the ineffable.\n\nWhen we speak of art, of morals, we grasp at shadows. The Mona Lisa stands before us, a woman’s smile painted in oils, and we speak of its parts, the play of light, the shadows cast, the history it bears, but these words fall short. The heart knows more than the tongue can tell. Ask a man his favorite poem and he'll say, there's just something about it. You cannot pin down art or ethics like a butterfly, for they are of the same cloth as the wind. As O'Connor said, a story tells what words cannot alone. Even when the tale is spun, something remains, beyond the grasp of the critic’s pen. Ethics too shares this nature. Wittgenstein saw it clear, ethics cannot be spoken. It is of the world beyond. It is this something, this intangible essence, that binds art and morality together, a thread running through both, unseen yet felt.\n\nMorality and art, they touch us deep down, where the soul resides, in the noumenal realm, as Kant might name it. They strike us hard and true, beyond the reach of reason’s grasp. In literature, this bond is strongest. McKean saw it, the moral heart of the written word. Literature bears upon it the weight of values, like life itself, where music or painting may not. In living, we find values, and in literature, their echo. It matters to us, because there, amidst the ink and paper, we find reflections of our very selves.",
            "In the breadth of today's Germany there lies a power, a unity of land and people shaped by the shadows of the Bavarian Alps and stretching to the windswept shores of the Baltic at Kiel. This land breathes with the pulse of its history, from the banks of the Rhine at Köln to the heartland and onward to the Saxon stone of Dresden by the Elbe. Germany, with its own peculiar culture, is a tapestry woven from disparate threads, tribes long vanished, yet their presence echoing in the very soil.\n\nGermania, cradle of the Germanic soul. The name itself a mystery, a subject of scholarly debates and whispered histories. Tacitus penned the tale of Tungrians, a tribe of old, their name worn like a cloak before they crossed the Rhine to clash with Gaulish warriors. Julius Caesar, chronicler of conquest, first carved \"Germanus\" into his records of the Gallic Wars. He wielded this word to mark those unconquered, those who dared the Rhine's icy embrace under guile's shadow. The Gauls spoke it, distinguishing the wild men beyond their dominion. Some say it named a neighbor in their tongue, others claim it was the spear, the ger, or the clamor, a shout of war, rising from German throats.\n\nTacitus, in his solemn prose, wrote of the Germans in De Origine et situ Germanorum of AD 98. He spoke of a people untainted by foreign blood, untouched by the sea's wanderers. \"Who,\" he asked, \"would forsake Asia or Africa, Italy for this harsh land of Germany, with its fierce clime and stern visage, save for the call of home?\"\n\nAnd who indeed would abandon the splendor of Rome for Germania's wilderness? The Romans would not, not then. They ventured forth, seeking the riches of Germania, yet they returned to their empire's embrace. The Germanic tribes, emerging on the first century's dawn, traded at Rome's borders, bartered their land's bounty, and lent their arms to Rome's legions, a bond forged in necessity. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "In the world of Twelfth Night, disguise is a double-edged sword, a useful tool in weaving the intricate tapestry of deceit, yet a perilous one that can bind the soul to its own shadows. A man or woman must eventually tear off the mask lest they be swallowed whole by its artifice, yet therein lies the crux of the discord: to cast aside the falsehood is to risk the solitude of alienation. One must weigh the self against the fragile threads of human connection, for though some may greet the revelation with indifference, others will find in it a bitter betrayal, a jest too cruel to forgive.\n\nWhen the guise involves the crossing of the gender line, the stakes rise higher. It calls forth questions deep and primal, the chief among them being, why? Why does one cast aside their own skin to wear the garb of another? Take Viola, who cloaks herself in manhood as a shield against the perils of an unknown land: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her ruse, a necessity born of survival, leaves her adrift from the sisterhood that might have been her solace. So adept is she in her role that she becomes the object of Olivia’s misguided affections, mistaking her for Sebastian, and thus entangling herself in the web of love's mistaken identity: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Meanwhile, she must navigate the unspoken longing that simmers between her and Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo the modern eye, Twelfth Night unfolds as a tableau of hidden truths, where deception serves to peel back the layers of the heart’s repression, exposing the tender roots of desire. It stirs the question within Olivia's breast: is her heart drawn to Cesario by the semblance of manhood, or is there a glimmer of something else, a whisper of the unspeakable? Yet, the ease with which she transfers her affections to Sebastian suggests a different tale, one where the heart is swayed by the superficial, a parody of sorts on society's penchant for the skin-deep: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315). Thus, the dance of deception and revelation plays out, a mirror to the desires and duplicities that dwell within us all.",
            "In the austere reaches of German South West Africa, a cruelty was visited upon the land, a scourge that bore the name of empire and left in its wake the bones of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. Yet the expanse of such dominion cannot be so easily measured, for the German colonial empire was a patchwork of policies and terrains as varied as the lands it claimed. In its territories, the fabric of education was woven in many hues. When the British laid their hands upon German East Africa, known as Tanganyika, in the year of 1919, they uncovered a multitude of learned souls, Africans who had been touched by the hand of German pedagogy. In the lands of Kamerun and beyond, the efforts of the Germans found favor in the eyes of those who chronicled such ventures.\n\nBut in the vastness of South West Africa, now called Namibia, there lay a different tale. Here, unlike in East Africa where the state had forged schools and took upon itself the mantle of native education, the task was left to the missionaries. These societies labored with scant support from the government, which instead turned its gaze to the education of its own, crafting a system of state schools for Europeans and tightening its hold upon the missionary institutions. This divergence cast long shadows over South West Africa, shadows that lingered beyond the German reign. Where other colonies could count among their number many who had learned to read and write, in South West Africa the people remained shrouded in ignorance, untouched by the light of education. The reasons for this lay in the tangled roots of society, politics, and economy, a complexity that this discourse seeks to unravel, drawing upon new insights into the settlers and colonial rulers and their views on the native peoples.\n\nThe annals of literature are rich with accounts of German colonial education, penned mostly in that tongue, in the days when the empire still stood. These early works sought to lay bare the nature of the educational practices within the colonies. In later years, the discourse broadened, as English voices entered the fray with comparative studies and deeper examinations of educational nuances. Such works laid bare the disparities between the colonies. Notable among these is Cohen’s study, which peers into the heart of education in South West Africa and East Africa, drawing lines between them and seeking the roots of their differences. Cohen points to the settlers of South West Africa as a key to understanding the educational landscape.\n\nIn comparison to Germany’s other holdings, South West Africa was graced with a climate more forgiving, though much of its expanse was a barren desert. The Europeans were drawn by this kinder clime, and by 1913, their numbers swelled to nearly 15,000, a multitude when set against the mere 5,336 who called East Africa home, the next in line for settler population.",
            "In the dusty annals of time, the tale of two nations unfolds, the United States of America and Mexico, locked in a contest of wills spanning fifty-seven long years, a rivalry that twisted like a river from 1836 to 1893. The war that raged between them took its most furious form in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, a time when the United States, with all the fervor of manifest destiny, descended upon Mexico, wresting from her grasp the lands of Texas and the American Southwest. The echoes of this strife reverberated through the years, a crescendo of conflict that finally dimmed in the shadow of the Great War to come. These two nations, at odds over matters of faith, culture, and the riches of the earth, were no different than many others who find themselves neighbors.\n\nBorders, drawn by the hand of man, are lines that divide yet bind. Nations that share them often find themselves in the throes of contention, bound by the land they inhabit and the interests they hold dear. The tale of America and Mexico is a tale known well in the eternal dance of nations. As David M. Pletcher mused, only in Mexico and Cuba does one find the enduring diplomatic trials that the United States has faced, for these lands lie close, their histories intertwined with that of the American nation, while others in the Latin world have known peace with the eagle to the north.\n\nReligion, that ancient tether of man, cast a shadow between these lands, a shadow that has darkened many a nation’s heart through the ages. As Sally Frahm observed, where once Americans stood against the specters of fascism and communism, in earlier days, their ire was reserved for the papal and the royal. The ideological clash that simmered beneath the surface was not unlike that of the Cold War, yet it was a war of the soul, not of governance, a discord of belief that lingered with the inherited distrust from the colonial past, a barrier to the peace they sought.\n\nSeventeen times, Diehl and Goerts tell us, these nations met in dispute during those fifty-seven years, most over the land and the lawless raids that plagued their borders. Bandits and outlaws, like phantoms of the frontier, made their mark, and it was only through the might of military resolve that peace was wrought upon those restless lands. But as Schmitt recounts, the rivalry waned, for Mexico, in time, found herself tethered to the United States in ways critical and numerous. The American eye turned from conquest to commerce, and the ambitions of expansion gave way to the subtler hand of economic reach in the latter years of that century of change.",
            "Fifteen years back, a shadow fell across my life, an affliction unexpected and unknown, the sort that leaves you grasping in the dark for remnants of the world you thought you knew.\n\nThen I was a nurse, drawn to the vocation out of a yearning for the security and constancy absent from my youth. They said, You'll find work always; sickness is a constant companion in this world. These words, a refrain in my ears through the years of youth and beyond. Thus, the dreams of science and words, the pursuits of the mind, were set aside for the caring of bodies.\n\nAnd there I found myself, at forty-six, alone, the coffers empty and unable to toil. The passage of fifteen years has seen me sustained by Social Security Disability, yet I claim nothing as mine. Survival is a daily skirmish, an unending siege upon my sense of safety and worth. Certainty has abandoned me, save for the truth of kin and comrades who have stood by me. Strength falters in the wake of true calamity, believe me.\n\nEmergencies, they are life's unbidden guests, from the minor to the mighty, and no amount of preparation can shield us from all. The certainty of unpredictability is the only guarantee.\n\nIn this land, the call is often to forsake reliance upon the government, its promise crumbling and corrupt. Yet, I yearn for a people who trust and aid one another, rather than each soul retreating to solitude and self-reliance.\n\nThe myth speaks of rugged individualism, yet our ancestors' survival was not in solitude but in shared burdens, respect, and aid. Those pioneers who faced the Rockies did not reach the sea by standing alone.\n\nSo prepare, as I have. A kit for calamity, with supplies aplenty, from first aid to sustenance and means of light and warmth. If there is soil for sowing and skill for preserving, embrace it. A wood stove is wise, though its wisdom fades in a tenement.\n\nBut as you prepare, reach out. Know those who dwell beside you.",
            "In the ancient mists of time, somewhere in the realm of the fifth or sixth century before the common era, there was born a prince who would be known to the world as Buddha. His journey was one of relinquishment and awakening, and from his teachings sprang forth a way of life, a path known as Buddhism, with its most steadfast followers forming the sect of Theravada. This faith, now stretching across two and a half millennia, has morphed through the ages, its face altered from the visage it bore in the days when Buddha trod the earth. In places like Sri Lanka, where Theravada holds sway, one can witness the annual water-cutting ceremony, a ritual of import to monks and laymen alike, though the Buddha spoke not of such celebrations. These changes, they run deep, from the outward customs to the very heart of the religion's salvific doctrines. The Theravada Buddhist brotherhood, both in the cloister and without, has seen its tenets bend and shift, shaped by forces both from within and without, some in opposition, some indifferent.\n\nThere are terms, distinctions, that shall guide this discourse. The internal and the external. Internal, a force born of those within the Buddhasasana, whether they wear the robes or not. External, a force from beyond the fold, from those who know not the Buddha’s way. Hostile forces, those which strike against the Buddhist kin, born of disregard or enmity. Benign forces, indifferent to the harm or aid they may bring, like a wind that blows without care for the leaves it stirs. These terms will march through our narrative time and again.\n\nTo begin, one must delve into the essence of this faith, the doctrines that form the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. The seekers of this path take sanctuary in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Tripitaka, the three great baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka, where the Suttas lie; the Vinaya Pitaka, home of the rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, keeper of the metaphysical truths. Within these truths are Anatta, the absence of self; Dukkha, the suffering inherent in existence; Anicca, the impermanence of all. Only in the understanding of these can the endless cycle of death and rebirth, Sansara, be brought to its end. With it shall cease lobha, dosa, and moha—desire, hatred, and delusion—upon reaching enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the way of life, with five precepts for the laymen (to refrain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxication) and many more for the monks. The most fundamental of teachings, the four noble truths, begin with Dukkha, the acknowledgment of life’s suffering. Next, the truth that attachment begets suffering. Finally, the truth that this suffering can indeed be surmounted."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.

I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the vast and boundless theater of human discourse, culture stands as a silent arbiter, shaping the contours of understanding between men. It is a shadow, defined as much by its absence as by its presence, elusive and intangible, a tapestry woven from myriad threads of tradition and belief. Culture is not a monolith, not a singular creed, but rather a mosaic of differing hues, each piece a testament to the complexity of human experience. To say that all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese compliant is to paint with a brush too broad and too unseeing. The discerning negotiator knows that beneath the surface of such generalizations lies the true essence of a people, and it is this essence that must be grasped if one is to navigate the currents of negotiation with any hope of success.\n\nTo approach a foreign culture is to stand at the threshold of an unknown land, where the familiar is rendered strange and comparisons rise unbidden to the mind. In seeking to understand the hearts and minds of others, one must delve into the annals of their history, uncover the biases that shape their view of the world. Yet judgment must be set aside, for to change a culture is beyond the ken of any man; one must accept it as it is, and learn to move within its bounds, especially when one's own position is fraught with weakness. When treading upon foreign soil, a respect for customs and beliefs is the balm that soothes the wounds of misunderstanding and paves the way to accord.\n\nCulture is a hydra-headed beast, not confined to the borders of nations but thriving within the walls of corporations. Each company, a microcosm unto itself, cultivates its own ethos, some demanding ceaseless toil, others embracing a more languid pace. The fabric of corporate culture is visible in the garb of its denizens, in the tenor of their speech, in the manner by which tasks are apportioned. Philanthropy may be lauded or constrained within the bounds of sanctioned benevolence. The diversity of American enterprise is a testament to the variegated nature of thought that dwells within the societal sphere, a reminder that beneath a seemingly uniform exterior lies a world of difference.\n\nYet beyond the tapestry of culture lies the bedrock of values, the sacred why that governs the conduct of men. In a world where honor and harmony are held in esteem, no man will cast aspersions upon his kin to gain advantage at the negotiating table. Conversely, in lands where the hard bargain is king, a swift settlement is not always the sought-after prize. Understanding these truths is the key that unlocks the door to fruitful negotiation. But beyond the general lies the specific, for it is in knowing the man across the table, in discerning the contours of his soul, that one finds the path to success.",
            "In the quiet corridors of the mind where the echoes of ancient texts murmur and fade, a fool may whisper to himself that there is no God. So begins the Psalm, a lamentation of disbelief, which St. Anselm seizes upon to lay the foundation of his argument for the divine. He speaks not alone, for beside him in this discourse stands Thomas Aquinas, a man of reason and learned ways. Both hold fast to the conviction, the unyielding belief in the God of scripture, and it is our task to weigh their words, to measure their arguments against each other in the crucible of thought. And so we start, accepting as they do, the presence of this God, without which their words would be as dust, scattered and unanchored. Yet for all their certainties, neither offers us a complete tapestry of belief, a seamless cloak of understanding.\n\nAnselm turns inward, seeking the divine in the recesses of the soul, for he argues that God resides within our understanding, unbanishable by mere denial. In the labyrinthine passages of his reasoning, he suggests that proof of God is inscribed upon the mind itself, needing no foreign corroboration. This is faith, he tells us, the acceptance of truth unseen, a concept woven into the fabric of Christian doctrine.\n\nAquinas, however, walks a different path, one paved with the stones of reason and evidence. He would see God proven by the world itself, a revelation not of faith alone but of logical certainty. For the purpose of bringing others to belief, Aquinas offers not the elusive promise of faith, but the firm ground of reason, so that even the skeptic may find purchase. His five proofs stand as sentinels: the unmoved mover, the first cause, the necessary being, the gradation of beauty, and the order of the cosmos. In each, he finds a necessity for God, a piece of the puzzle unseen yet undeniable, existing beyond sight but not beyond understanding.\n\nThus we find ourselves between Anselm's introspective faith and Aquinas's rational certitude, each a reflection of the other, each a way to the divine. Yet, in the final reckoning, neither alone can encompass the breadth of what it means to believe.",
            "In the quiet, unfolding pages of a tale where time carries its own weary weight, some authors craft their words to stir within the reader a certain tremor of understanding, a whisper of recognition toward things that linger beyond the veil of immediate notice. Among them stands F. Scott Fitzgerald, a conjurer of images and sentiments in his work, The Great Gatsby, where he draws upon the old and worn techniques of language to breathe life into the shadows and hues of his world. \n\nFitzgerald, with the precision of a man shaping the very air around him, pairs words in ways that unsettle and intrigue, wrapping adjectives around nouns like garments ill-fitted but somehow true. He takes symbols and imbues them with meaning until they speak not only in whispers but in the quiet thunder of their presence. In Gatsby’s tale, the colors are not mere pigments on a palette but bearers of truth, heralds of memory—gold, green, white, gray, and the red of blood and pink of faded dreams.\n\nWhite and gray, these shades of the old world and the new, speak of uniformity, of a class that wears its years like a shroud, white in its pristine grandeur and gray in its tired descent. From the onset, Fitzgerald cloaks his characters in these colors, like Daisy and Jordan, forever enshrined in white as if the very fabric of their existence demands it. Nick too dons the white flannels to walk among the revelers of Gatsby’s night, and Tom, in his white shirt, stands as a monument to a past that refuses to fade. Even Catherine, powdered to a milky pallor, joins this procession of ghosts.\n\nYet it is not only in attire that Fitzgerald whispers these truths. The city, with its white chasms, speaks of a uniformity that presses down upon the soul, the gray names that march across Nick’s pages are specters of lives unlived, and the apartments stand like slices in a white cake, each indistinguishable from the next. In the valley of ashes, the gray cars and land tell of dreams turned to dust, the Italian child and the dog-seller, gray against the world, are echoes of a life that passes unnoticed.\n\nAnd when the time comes for these colors to tell their tale, it is Daisy who steps forth, dressed in white, seated in her little white roadster, a specter of longing in Gatsby’s fevered dream. She is the quiet heart of the storm, the gray haze of her fur collar a whisper of the storm to come. In the confrontation, she stands once more in white, an emblem of all that is sought and all that shall remain beyond grasp, a reminder of the uniformity that binds them all in this relentless dance of desire and despair.",
            "In the heart of San Diego County, where the sun lays its gentle hand upon the land, the earth yields its bounty, nurturing a world of green beneath a steadfast sky. The soil here, blessed by a climate kind and constant, gives rise to tomatoes and citrus, to the leafy greens and the squat forms of squash, to broccoli and herbs, and to the arborous gifts of peaches and lemons. Berries find their place in this symphony of growth, alongside the sweetness of honey and the fire of peppers. Here, in this cradle of plenty, the people find a hunger for the pure, for the untouched, and so the market swells with the desire for organic offerings, a demand that grows with every season. Community-supported agriculture finds its roots deep in this land, with waiting lists that stretch long under the weight of want. Eggs and milk, too, find their place in this cycle of need, and the farms that offer them open their doors to those who wander, who seek the solace of the land, who find joy in the simple acts of hiking and birdwatching. There’s a kind of wisdom in this, an understanding that to share the land is to enrich it, to open it to the gaze of others is to deepen its bounty, and so tours and programs spring forth, bringing with them the promise of government aid and the chance for learning, for profit, for a life intertwined with the soil.\n\nYet to walk this path of organic farming is to know both the promise and the burden. The richness of life that flourishes here, the plants and creatures that find refuge in the absence of poison, come at a cost. The labor is hard and unyielding, the struggle to keep the pests at bay, to nourish the earth without the aid of chemicals, demands a toll of sweat and time. Losses mount, and the efficiency of the great agricultural machines is a distant dream. Still, there are those who choose this way, who plant the cover crops, who rotate the grazing beasts, who pull the invaders from the ground with hands that know the land. They seek assistance, these stewards of the earth, in the form of knowledge and coin, to balance the scales of profit and the sanctity of the wild.\n\nThe land of concern is a stretch of 160 acres, caught between the town of Potrero and the vastness of the Cleveland National Forest. Here, where chaparral and Mediterranean grasses meet the ancient oaks, the land lies within the bounds of the East County Southern Foothills, a part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This place, a tapestry of life, holds within it over a hundred species, some clinging to the edge of extinction—the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, butterflies that dance on the brink, and the California gnatcatcher. Others teeter on the verge of decline, like the burrowing owls, their fates tied to the whims of time and man.\n\nThis land, long before the settlers claimed it in the name of homestead and profit, was a home to those who roamed it freely, who understood its rhythms and its seasons. The cattle ranchers and cordwood cutters came later, carving their lives from its bounty. The land holds those memories, like a silent witness to the passage of years. In seeking out a piece of this earth, from the digital marketplaces where land is bartered, I delved into the annals of government aid, seeking the ways a small farmer might find sustenance for their dreams and for the creatures that call this place home. In this quest, I found a farm, organic and thriving, a testament to what might be achieved here, a model for what the future could hold.",
            "There exists a tether between brothers, one that is knotted by fate and by the blood they share. It is a bond that cannot be severed, though it is fraught with the likes of love and pride, jealousy and cruelty. These emotions, they dwell within the heart of that bond and they stir like dust in the wind. A brother knows his kin in ways unspoken, sees in him a mirror that reflects his own self. And it is in the crucible of hardship that this bond reveals its true form, be it benevolent or malign. When these emotions surface, they come at a price steep and unforgiving. To understand them is to reckon with their repercussions. In the eyes of a brother, one sees not the world’s view but the unvarnished truth of what he is. Their deeds and the echoes of those deeds mark the essence of their character. Such is the tale in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers navigate this tumultuous theme, their hearts laid bare amidst the verdant tapestry of their world. They embark on a journey doomed from the start, where the bitter tang of disappointment and the fierce burn of pride collide in a moment of reckoning, and only one walks away. This theme is drawn out through the stark portrayal of Doodle, the protagonist, and the dance of emotions that sway between them, all seen through the narrator’s gaze, a lens that distills the turmoil within and shapes his actions.\n\nPride is the lodestar guiding the protagonist’s every step. From the first time he and Doodle venture into the world together to their last ill-fated journey, resentment simmers beneath his skin. He yearned for a brother to mold, to pass on the secrets of holding breath, running, leaping, climbing the old vines of Woman Swamp. A companion to race to Horsehead Landing, a partner to perch with atop the great pine behind the barn. But such dreams were dashed against the rocks of Doodle’s frailty, his heart too weak to hold the weight of life’s vigor. It was a cruel blow to the young boy whose head was filled with fantasies as wild as the wind, only to see them crumble to dust. Anger took root in him, and he pondered the unthinkable, to snuff out the life of his own brother with a pillow. What manner of child contemplates such darkness? Yet, the smallest smile from the fragile child was enough to thaw the ice in his heart. That simple gesture, a flicker of light in the shadows, rekindled a hope within him that perhaps his resolve was not as unyielding as stone. Deep within, there lay an innate love for his brother, unspoken and undeniable.",
            "The human brain, a labyrinthine and inventive mechanism, is a tangled web of processing. As the seasons of technology have marched from the crude to the modern age, so too have the metaphors we employ to capture its essence. Once likened unto a waxen tablet, then a papyrus scroll, later a tome, and now the machinations of a computing machine. But in your wanderings through the brain’s corridors, mind that these comparisons, for all their worth, hold their own limitations and may lead you astray.\n\nThe journey of information begins with the world outside, with the senses that transmute the tangible world—touch, warmth, sound, light—into the language of electrochemical whispers. Through the brain’s own secret codex, this sensory tale is reshaped in layers, both from the ground up and the top down. Cast your gaze upon a darkened box amid a field of white; the bottom-up process assembles the simple truths of color, angle, edge—where contrast is stark and sudden—to tell you what you see is a box. Yet, it is the top-down that grants the wisdom, that tells you it is box and not void.\n\nIn the heart of this process, a sentinel of attention stands guard, choosing what signal to heed and which to set aside. As you peer down at the grass beneath your feet, it whispers that each blade is unseen, yet call your name from the clamor and it rings clear. There are myriad levels of comprehension, and with each, attention casts its shadow anew upon the outcome.\n\nFor the brain to make sense of its information, it must first gather it in memory’s embrace. There are the fleeting whispers of sensory memory, the brief grasp of working memory, and the enduring hold of long-term memory. It begins with the encoding, a process as varied as the senses themselves. Words can be etched by the eye, the ear, or by meaning itself. Once gathered, it must be preserved. For some creatures, working memory endures a scant span, sustained by a current racing through a neural circuit. Long-term recollection is thought to lie in the scaffold of proteins.\n\nMany are the maps that chart the organization of knowledge within the mind. Some trace their lines from human recollection, others from the realm of machines, and yet others from the study of the brain’s very fabric. The model of the semantic network draws a web where nodes are ideas, connected by the sinews of their kinship. “Chair” might find its path to “table,” and thence to “wooden,” and onward still.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States of America found itself cast into the abyss of a financial cataclysm. Unyielding unemployment surged forth like an unbidden tide, the once robust edifice of the housing market crumbled to dust, and the mighty corporations that stood as the pillars of industry lay broken and desolate. This recession, a specter unrelenting, haunts us still, compelling us to ponder the genesis of such ruin and the means by which it might be forestalled. At the heart of this calamity lay the avarice and folly of those entrusted with power, whose ineptitude compelled banks and enterprises to dispense sub-prime loans upon the fragile bones of an unripe and inadequate financial foundation. Meanwhile, the entities known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coaxed into the underwriting and repackaging of these precarious obligations into instruments of financial sorcery, known by the acronyms CDO and CDS. When the borrowers faltered, as they were bound to, the vaults of the banks lay bare, and the contagion spread across the repackaged mortgages like wildfire, consuming the broader economy in its wake.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown in the twilight of the 20th century, under the watch of the Clinton administration, which sought to bolster its grasp on power by currying favor with the populace. In pursuit of this ambition, the administration loosened the fetters of lending, unwittingly paving the path to the sub-prime debacle that would unfurl seven years hence. As recorded by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” With prophetic clarity, Holmes foresaw the wreckage that lay ahead: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As the tale unfolds, it is apparent, as Holmes prognosticated, that these reckless lendings would indeed herald the unraveling of the economy.\n\nThe economy, like a great ship in storm-tossed seas, was beset by manifold perils, not least of which was the intricate web of mortgage structures newly conceived. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations—these tools of financial alchemy—were wielded with abandon in the years leading to the crisis, binding ever more tightly the fortunes of households and markets to the capricious housing sector. Thus did they overextend themselves, precariously perched upon the precipice, vulnerable to the slightest shift in the winds of price.\n\nAnd so the bubble burst, and the institutions that had placed their faith in these mortgage-backed instruments were left to reckon with the wrathful void. The foremost investment banks of the nation reported their burdens of mortgage debts, a staggering $4.1 trillion, an amount that stood as a testament to folly, equaling a third of the nation's gross domestic product. In the denouement, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were cast off at a pittance, Lehman Brothers dissolved into the ether, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the mantle of commercial banks, shackled by the chains of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, laden with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were enfolded into the embrace of government control come September of 2008.",
            "The art of exposition, that treacherous landscape where the threads of a tale are laid bare, revealing the careful weave of a writer's toil. It is a place where a storyteller might soar, their words a tapestry pulling the reader into a world spun with a careful hand. Or it may be the very place where the reader's eyes grow heavy, and they seek escape through the turning of a page or the click of a button, cursing the creator's name, a lamentation echoed by the disgruntled murmurings of Dr. Merlin, who finds herself vexed by the overabundance of detail, a deluge of information drowning the senses.\n\nExposition, it stands there, indifferent, not a friend to the scribe.\n\nThe wise reader, versed in the adage \"Show, don't tell,\" knows well the danger of slipping into the mire of endless prose, where action ceases and the weight of words suffocates. Dr. Merlin, despite her wisdom, finds herself ensnared in passages thick with exposition, where the narrative stagnates or overflows with a glut of history. It is the siren call, urging the writer to lay down the past in haste, to clear the path for what lies ahead, a temptation not unlike the whisper of another voice bidding the author to recount every minute detail of their characters' bygone days.\n\nExposition, the act of recounting the tale, often in the plainest of tongues. In the realm of cinema, it emerges when one character heaps upon another a torrent of revelations, reminiscent of the mariner's ancient tale. In the realm of fiction, it is the author who bears the burden of this telling.\n\nConsider this: you are drawn into a story and are told that the heroine crossed paths with her beloved at a time and place, they wed in splendid fashion, and her husband met his end before her eyes. You would not expect this saga to unfold across mere pages, devoid of the voices and souls of those within. You would yearn for the author to linger upon the husband's essence, to reveal through his words and deeds the depth of his love, and you would wish for the heroine to display, in grand and subtle gestures, how his presence illuminated and enriched her world. Such depth would bind you to the husband's fate and unveil the heroine's heart, her vision of him, the strength of their union, the reflections of her spirit mirrored in his gaze. Thus, you would grieve his passing alongside her, and in doing so, find yourself entwined with her journey.\n\nIn essence, you crave flesh upon the bones of this simple tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs the weaver of stories, it falls to you to bestow that flesh. (*gazes upon the metaphor, sighs, and presses forward*) The temptation to hasten through events is ever present. Perhaps you introduce a new soul, once of the Air Force, now the guardian of a night-shrouded gas station, twice wed, childless, a fisherman of weekends, harboring dreams of ownership, and a taste for Eggs Benedict with the dawn.",
            "In the half-light of an Ohio dawn, I watched the flickering screen relay its tales of woe and violence. Columbus, they said. NBC 4, live and urgent, August thirteenth, two thousand eleven. The lead story, a grim testament from Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had taken to his wife with a blade, though her name remained unspoken, shrouded in the silence of the unsaid. His visage appeared, captured in a mug shot, a countenance carved from malice itself. They spared but two minutes for this grim development, the details sparse and raw. He had stabbed her, the cold metal biting flesh, and now sat shackled by the law. Two minutes seemed fitting for a tale still unfolding. \n\nThen came the tale of Travis Buyers, eighteen, a soul caught in the crosshairs of an early morning in Sharon Woods. A gunshot had felled him, left him clinging to life, while the streets whispered of shadows and secrets. The SWAT Team prowled, yet no man had been ensnared by justice. The brevity of this account was a bitter pill, a reflection perhaps of the world’s skewed gaze. A black man, a black neighborhood. How often are such lives glossed over, their stories fading like smoke? Were it a white child, a white soul missing or wronged, the clamor would rise like thunder. Yet here, silence reigned, a stark testament to the world’s indifference.\n\nNext, they spoke of a gunshot wound etched into the skin of a Med-Flight helicopter. The air had borne a .22 caliber bullet, a silent messenger of malice. Crime-Stoppers, they said, would pay five thousand dollars for a whisper leading to the shooter’s capture. \n\nThe sky promised rain and storms for the morrow, with temperatures lingering in the mid to low eighties. A whisper of weather, a siren call to keep the watchers tethered to the screen.\n\nA robbery, too, on Clime Road, where shadows moved with intent. A dark-skinned man, they said, clad in a hoodie, six foot tall and a hundred fifty pounds. Their words lingered, dwelling on the darkness of his skin, the color of his deeds. \n\nAnother tale, a man named Rene Rodriguez, bound in chains of his own making. A Texas drug-kingpin, weaving a web of marijuana from the south to Ohio. Twenty-five years in prison, they said, though the words came strange, three hundred months rolled off their tongues, a calculation meant to chill. Hispanic, they called him, a detail that seemed to matter little to his crimes yet was spoken nonetheless. \n\nAnd so the news ran its course, a river of stories flowing past, each one a reflection of the world’s fractured face.",
            "In the vast and intricate landscape of financial instruments, there lies a creation known as the exchange traded fund, or ETF. It is a security crafted to mirror the movements of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund, yet it possesses the nimbleness of a stock, flowing through the exchanges like a current in a river. An ETF offers the broad embrace of diversification akin to an index fund, while bestowing upon its holder the singular advantages of stock ownership—selling short, buying on margin, the liberty to acquire but a single share. Though these lures are many and strong, the expense ratios of ETFs remain modest, markedly lower than those of mutual funds that roam the financial plains. Yet, it is not without its shadows, for each trade commands a commission, akin to the tolls exacted on stock orders. \n\nThe allure of ETFs extends to the myriad funds they offer, each a new path to tread. But the wise investor knows the necessity of scrutiny, to ascertain whether the promises of diversification ring true and to what measure they do so. Thus, we turn our gaze to the ETF known as IHF, to pit it against the ten mighty holdings that form its core, seeking to unravel the truth of whether a solitary ETF can match the bounty of a diverse clutch of stocks, or if greater riches lie in a different weave of the same threads to yield a more optimal return or sharper ratio.\n\nTo navigate this quest, we must narrow our focus to the ten holdings that command 63.58% of the ETF's entire essence. Below, the ten holdings await, their share of the whole laid bare.\n\nIn our endeavor to grasp how these ten stocks embody the spirit of ETF IHF, we shall adjust the percentages of assets to a perfect hundred, calculating each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, were it composed solely of these ten in the proportion crafted by the ETF's architects. The figures of Beta and return, they rest within the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, a revelation emerges: a portfolio of these ten holdings yields a return 6.11% greater than the ETF itself, a 16% surge. The Beta of these ten is .12 beneath the ETF's own. Thus far, the signs suggest that a portfolio of these top ten could promise richer returns with gentler risk. Yet, we must consider the chance that the means of these two portfolios lie too close in statistical terms.\n\nTo discern whether these paths diverge truly, we must measure the standard deviation of each stock, adjusting them to a perfect hundred, comparing their collective sway to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a steep decline in the submissions of commuter logs as the third month of the project drew on. A thing disheartening to behold, and elusive as the reasons might be. The onset of winter on a campus flanked by the stubborn bones of New England saw a dwindling of those who might venture forth by bicycle or stride, and thus some part of the decline might be accounted for. December, a month that signals the close of the fall semester, finds all absorbed in the fevered completion of assignments, the tallying of grades, and other such reckonings. The mere thought of filling out a commuter log might have slipped through the cracks of consciousness for many souls. Moreover, December heralds the advent of the holiday season's haste and the long respite for students and faculty alike, a time when the campus itself seems to draw a long breath and pause. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, perhaps another piece of the puzzle to explain the scant logs of that month. Yet none of this elucidates the sparse submissions of February. One might surmise that any endeavor of this nature is bound to begin with a fierce spark of energy and enthusiasm, only to wane in its intensity. To counter this inevitable ebb, we inaugurated the Carpool Challenge Week, a concerted campaign in March, seeking to rekindle the spirit of the endeavor, which did see an upward tick in log submissions for that month. Thus, we faced the challenge of sustaining the momentum of the project against the natural pull of diminishing interest as well as the specific disruptions of holidays and semester breaks so common in academic life.\n\nAnother hurdle for this endeavor, or any such venture into alternative commuting, lies in the simple truth that people cherish the liberty and autonomy afforded by the steering wheel of their own vehicles. This love is etched deep into the heart of our culture. Hence, it is paramount to offer inducements to entice the populace toward alternate paths of commuting. We dispensed a multitude of prizes in the form of gift certificates to local eateries, coffeehouses, massage parlors, the town's independent bookstore, and even some larger national chains. Yet it would have been a curiosity to behold the impact on participation had the stakes been raised—perhaps with the offering of a fine bicycle, a hybrid vehicle, or an electric car. Such offerings might have served to stave off the decline in engagement that the project witnessed. The nature of the prizes remained unchanged throughout the course of the project. Yet, if the worth of these prizes had seen an increase as time wore on, it might have bolstered participation. The gift cards sufficed at the project's outset, but had we announced in December the inclusion of a pair of bicycles, and in January the prospect of a hybrid or electric car, one can only ponder how the tides of participation and engagement might have swelled instead of receding.",
            "In the vast vaults of the Library of Congress, where the ghostly flicker of early Edison films lies entombed, I found myself drawn to the strange allure of the trick films, fifteen in all, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These curious relics, born of the early days of cinema, wielded the cutting edge of creative editing to conjure illusions that danced upon the screen. My study, with its gaze fixed upon their poetic essence, sought to unravel the threads that tied these spectral apparitions together and to glimpse the strange mutations that emerged in the later years. At the dawn of the twentieth century, the trick film was a creature of the stage, framed by the rigid proscenium, its movements confined to long and medium shots, bound by the iron law that one shot must suffice for one film. Yet, there were bold whispers of rebellion, of films that dared to splice together multiple shots, fracturing the old order.\n\nWhat strikes the eye in these early trick films is the steadfast allegiance to the interior set, the camera an unyielding sentinel before the stage's proscenium. It does not stir, does not chase after men or things. This static composition, a vestige of theater and vaudeville's magic acts, was the common currency of the early cinematic world. The actors, like shadow puppets, moved only in the lateral plane, never venturing towards the camera's eye. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The players enter from the right, traversing the stage's breadth, and even as they slip from view, the camera remains, indifferent and unmoved.\n\nThe proscenium's dominion dictates that shots remain long, and at times, medium, but never close. In these films, the camera does not draw the actors near, does not peer into their eyes. It is an echo of the theater, where the audience beheld the full breadth of the stage, the actors' movements framed within its borders. In these embryonic days of film, the players lingered in the middle ground, the camera never beckoning them forth.\n\nIn the early days of trick films, the dictum was that one conceptual shot must suffice for a film. Such constraints kept most films brief, a minute or less, dictated by the frames per second. The narrative, too, was constrained, offering up vaudeville tricks— vanishing acts and transformations—with scant story to bind them. Yet, even within these confines, the illusion was crafted, a single \"shot\" in the viewer's eye often stitched together from many, weaving the magic of appearance and disappearance. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an elder among trick films. In its deceptive simplicity, the attentive eye discerns the seam where Mary's \"head\" falls, an illusion spun from a single thread to the viewer's mind.",
            "The Gothic novel, a paradox in itself, bears the weight of ages upon its back. Ian Watt calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New',\" a strange concoction of time's passage rendered in letters. It stands both ridiculed and revered, accused of shallowness yet extolled for its capacity to invoke the 'terrible sublime' as Burke might whisper from the shadows. The genesis of this form, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, took ancient romance and the dawning modernity, weaving them into the fabric of the Gothic. Here, Walpole drew from the stage of yesteryears and the mimicry of nature found in novels newly birthed, calling forth \"A Gothic Story\" to mark the beginning of something not yet understood. \n\nThe Gothic, a ghost from medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition, rose amidst a world that saw it as an echo of the past, crude and unsophisticated against the backdrop of modernity's march. Yet in its heart lies a fusion, the ancient's theatrical flair with the novel's intimate glimpse into the soul, a mingling that grants it the power to endure. It is this strange alchemy, this union of past and present, that allows the Gothic to stand timeless and yet fresh, a relic that renews itself in the eyes of those distanced by centuries.\n\nChivalry, one of the Gothic's most radiant ideas, shines through these narratives like the glint of armor in moonlight. The medieval knight, noble and steadfast, finds a place in The Castle of Otranto, where the ideals of chivalry are both preserved and transformed. To the Gothic scribe, chivalry was more than mere pageantry; it was a lament for an ideal, a mirror held up to a society seen wanting. Walpole, amidst a world of political turmoil, yearned for a return to the bravery and honor he perceived as lost. In these tales, the bygone era of gallantry is exalted, romanticized, a whisper of the Romantic movement yet to come, a plea for the present to be bettered by the past's virtues.\n\nIn Frederic, a character in Walpole's tale, the reader finds this chivalric spirit embodied. Before Frederic steps into view, his presence is felt, a tapestry of knightly images woven into his very essence. He is a prince, a soul marked by suffering, touched by tragedy, believed to have fallen to infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is painted with broad strokes, an exaggeration that heralds the Gothic's penchant for excess, a precursor of tropes to be.",
            "In the quiet dance of commerce, supply chain management moves goods upon the earth from the whisper of a customer’s desire to the raw sinews of material, through the loom and shuttle of supply, the forge of production, and out into the wide arms of distribution. It was in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two that a man named Keith Oliver, a seer in the world of consultancy, gave name to this ballet. He spoke of the grand orchestration, the laying down of plans, the execution, the reigns held firm and loose, all in service of the ever-hungry customer’s need, met with the swiftness of the hawk and the efficiency of the ant.\n\nIn the cosmos of supply chain, six stars shine bright: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools of the trade, the compass by which a manager charts his course toward the shores of customer satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the first step, lays the foundation stone for the structure that is the supply chain. It is here the plans are drawn, etched into the earth and air. Here, managers peer into the depths of the market, the oracle that tells what the people crave. And when they see clearly what the people demand, they decide upon the goods to be born, and the number of those goods. Then, the question of where these goods shall take shape arises, which plant will best honor the balance of volume and quality in homage to the customer’s yearning. With this settled, the next focus is the meticulous scheduling of labor and the vigilance over the machines that hum and toil. Production is the cornerstone, each detail more precious than gold, for the lack of foresight here spells ruin, a wasteland of time and treasure lost. In the corridors of Wal-Mart and Target, I have seen the gospel of process laid out, each task a ritual from the stitching of uniforms to the arrival of the great trucks, the blueprint that guards against chaos and guides the hands of the workers.\n\nThe second star, supply, is a dance of strategy and partnership. Decisions made here carve out the soul of a facility, from which the bonds of outsourcing grow. A single product may be the child of many divisions, each with its own rhythm, its own tools and craftsmen. A manager must look upon these divisions and discern where each piece of the puzzle fits, or whether the hand of another company should be called upon. For outsourcing is a song of velocity, a swift river that promises quality and adaptability, all while holding fast to the promise of low cost, the lifeblood of the endeavor.",
            "In the vast expanse of Victorian literature, there lies a meticulous tapestry of detail and the looming specter of aristocracy. Yet, two novels wander from this beaten path, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, each weaving a shroud of enigma and the peculiar, a departure from the ordered world of their contemporaries. This mystique breathes life into their cast, unfurling the depths of their desires and torments.\n\nAnd thus, he was beset by a tumult of confounding visions, a fugue of the mind. He walked still in the company of Sikes and Crackit, their quarrels echoing in his ears, a phantom of his own devising, until he startled at the crack of gunfire. Cries pierced the tumult, lights danced before his eyes, and he was seized by some invisible force, borne away into clamor. In these fleeting specters ran the incessant ache of his being, a torment that gnawed at him without end. (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe novels wield this mystery through the lens of dreams or the fog of dreamlike reverie, the essence of which shifts with each telling. In Oliver Twist, these phantasms peel back the layers of the boy’s soul, revealing the shadows of his suffering and the truths he grasps at in the world around him. When the gunshot resurfaces in the 28th chapter, it strikes him anew in vivid recollection, as though he were adrift in a dream. The passage lays bare the frailty of his grasp on the events that engulf him, the peril of his condition mirrored in the spectres of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting consumes him, his senses dulled, the guiding hand unseen as it carries him away. He relives his despair, pain constant now and mingled with fear. The question of whose hand wrought his misfortune lingers, for it was not his own. This moment underscores his impotence, his inability to shape the course of his fate even as death looms near. A creeping resignation takes root, as if old Fagin's shadow had begun to fall upon him, pushing him towards a surrendering of spirit, numbing his will to fight. For surely, had he the strength, he would have struggled against the night that sought to claim him.\n\nThe day slipped through his fingers—a day? No day at all, vanished as soon as it came, and night settled once more, a night stretched in its terrible quiet, yet fleeting in its passing hours.",
            "It was some years past that I found myself in the employ of an after school program where I endeavored to guide young minds through the murky waters of academic struggle. The children, their faces a mosaic of youth's hope and confusion, came seeking aid in sundry subjects, though my particular gift lay in the realm of English and the written word. It was there that one of the instructors beckoned me toward a young boy named Adrian, a lad perhaps in the third or fourth grade, who faced a peculiar plight with reading.\n\nIn those early days, it became apparent to me that something was amiss. Adrian could pronounce some letters with a clarity that was almost musical, yet others eluded him entirely, a riddle wrapped in the innocence of childhood. The boy, of Latino descent, spoke English with a fluency that belied his struggle, and we wrestled with the words until the day I met his mother. The encounter came one afternoon as I watched over some children left behind while the others ventured forth on a field trip. She entered, speaking only in the soft cadence of Spanish, a language I barely grasped.\n\nThrough this halting exchange, a realization struck, heavy and undeniable. Adrian could indeed read, but his acquaintance with the English alphabet was tenuous at best. Whether this insight served him well, I cannot say, but I harbor the hope that he now walks an easier path.\n\nThis tale, it serves to illuminate the chasm of language in the schools of California, a divide not always visible to the naked eye. Even a child whose tongue dances effortlessly through English can find himself stymied by its written form. We nod in agreement that this problem stands before us, a silent giant. What then, do we do?\n\nFor Adrian, the remedy was straightforward: guidance in the ways of English reading, the alphabet, and the sounds they conjure. Yet for those whose grasp of English is tenuous, the solution sprawls complex and multifaceted. There is no single path to redemption. Dual language systems, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none stand alone as the panacea. The answer lies in an amalgamation of all.\n\nThe dual language system, it holds promise not merely for those with Spanish as their mother tongue, but for all children. Studies whisper of its success, of children in such programs surpassing their peers. Yet fear circles this notion, a specter of wasted resources and unheeded benefits. But fear is a poor counselor. If these programs were to become the rule rather than the exception, all might flourish. \n\nHow then do we proceed? Shall we insist on all teachers bearing the burden of bilingualism? No, such an expectation would be both unreasonable and unattainable. But there is no barrier to employing aides or tutors, those who walk the line between languages, guiding children across that divide.\n\nIn this lies the promise of a brighter future, where language ceases to be a barrier and becomes a bridge.",
            "From the time we're small and the world is a vast unknowable thing, they tell us of forces greater than us. Unseen but felt in the marrow of our bones. Some learn of it beneath the steeple's watch, others in the quiet halls of temples, or deep within the chambers of their own hearts seeking answers. We take on the faith of our forebears as if it were our own skin, yet some cast it off, believing in nothing beyond the self, a universe of one. We may hold one creed and then trade it like a weathered coat for another. Each path is a journey into the self, a quest for light in the shadowed corners of our lives.\n\nA cardinal, my father said, when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming its relentless rhythm on the tin roof, smoke curling from our cigarettes. The gutters poured like small cataracts, drowning the plants at the porch's edge. His eyes were lost to the rain, a gaze that seemed to seek something that had long slipped from memory. He'd grown thin, his clothes hanging loose like old ghosts, his hair sparse as the winter trees. Still he looked into the falling rain, avoiding my eyes. I felt the solitude, the fear, the words lodged in my throat like stones. I would have told him how the thought of missing him was a specter I couldn't face. Instead, I hugged him, then sat closer, our eyes joined in the rain of a June twilight.\n\nHe left this world in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The chemo and radiation were cruel mercies, stretching his days beyond the doctors' reckonings but at what cost I could not say. What kind of God, I wondered, would allow such suffering. I uttered no prayers to the night. If God was there, he'd turned a deaf ear long before.\n\nI could not bear witness as he crossed from this life to whatever lay beyond. I did not. I wished to remember him in life, not in the grasp of death. I knew him better than they, better than kin, and knew he would not have his child as a mourner at his passing. I curled into myself, a cocoon of grief, and waited three days for the news.\n\nNo one called. Not a soul.",
            "In the dusty annals of American thought, there moves the figure of John Taylor of Caroline, whose spirit carried the banner of Republicanism with a fervor that burned as brightly as the sun upon the Virginia fields he so dearly cherished. His was a life bound to the earth, the soil itself a testament to his convictions, and though he wandered briefly into the corridors of governance, it was the land that shaped his voice, a voice unyielding in its call for liberty and the sanctity of self-rule. His creed was one of agrarian virtue, a truth he held as firm as the ancient oaks, and from this truth sprang his every utterance on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the machinations of the judicial realm.\n\nTo Taylor, the United States was a blank canvas, untouched by the hands of history, a place where the architects of governance could carve out a republic unfettered by the chains of old tradition. He placed his faith in the natural rights of mankind, rights intertwined like the roots of a great tree, where the loss of one would bring ruin to all, leaving naught but hollow echoes of what once was. These rights, he contended, stood as a bulwark against the overreach of government, a testament to the state of nature where strength and cunning prevailed, but which civilization must transcend.\n\nIn his vision of an ideal society, Taylor saw the necessity of a government that mirrored the dual nature of man, both noble and base. He held steadfast to a moral duality, proclaiming that the virtues and vices of governance were as human as the hands that wielded its power. Good principles, he asserted, were those that safeguarded the sanctity of property, nurtured the soil, and kept the specter of capitalism at bay. Such a government, he believed, would stand firm against the tide of avarice and self-interest that threatened to drown it, for self-interest was the clay from which man was molded—evil only when it birthed societies that fed upon the lives of others. The governance of man required vigilance, an ever-watchful eye to ensure that no malign principle took root.\n\nTaylor, like his brethren in the Republican fold, held firm to a vision of the Constitution as a fortress with walls not to be breached by the expansion of Federal power beyond its written word. He saw the bloated Federal structure as a beast of burden, costly and prone to tyranny. Yet, he warned against a narrow reading of the sacred text, for without the light of its framers' intentions, such interpretation could lead to corruption. In his heart, it was the Declaration of Independence that stood as the true testament of the nation's soul, a proclamation of a union of sovereign states rather than a singular entity.",
            "I looked downwards, my mind adrift in a void that took in the scene with a cold detachment. In silence, with a perception honed by habit, I observed without connecting the image to any lofty concept, my mind parsing the view before me with a mechanical grace. Thoughts came and went, fleeting as shadows, so fluid and seamless was my awareness that it seemed I had no thoughts at all, only the liquid witnessing of the scene presented to my eyes.\n\nOnce, on the counsel of an artist I knew, I had acquired a book on art titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since I was six, I had yearned to draw, and this book promised enlightenment from the nature of a pencil to the cerebral dance that gives life to lines. Among its teachings was a method of encircling any image with a square frame, thus reducing a labyrinth of detail—a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen that opened into a dining room—into a simple, graspable vision of that fruit sitting on a bare plane.\n\nBut now, as I looked down at the bowl before me, my mind failed to conjure that artist's frame. I stood overwhelmed, awestruck, able only to gaze in silent wonder. Picasso waded through his blue period, Monet painted his love for the green world, and the Italian masters scattered color like a benediction. If ever I aspired to claim the mantle of artist, here lay the inception of my canvas, the nascent chapter of my tale, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched upon the chosen instrument, muscles knotted and released as my hand moved through air, my mind's intent taking form in what could have been a moment of pure creation. Water swirled, smooth as a glassy river, clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke free, carried into oblivion. Muscles tensed and twitched, more anxious with each attempt, my hand struck the toilet handle again. Yet the stubborn brown bundle clung tight, like a slug to the bowl's surface.\n\nMop gripped with a lax hold, feet planted firm, tie chafing at my neck, I frowned at the impudent mass of waste left as a token for the fools tasked with cleaning Rite Aid's bathrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, then my hand moved to the wall on my right, seized the end of the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it resembled a mitt. Straightening, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped with slow inevitability into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving bird...",
            "In the waning light of day, the roads lay stretched out like a great indifferent web, ensnaring the young and unwary. The dust settles on the grave statistics of teenage fatalities behind the wheel, a grim testament to the collision of youthful exuberance and inexperience. The National Institutes of Health would tell you, as if in some somber sermon, that the adolescent mind is not yet tempered for the perils of the road. The raw inexperience of youth is a specter haunting the highways, leaving in its wake a trail of overturned vehicles, reckless speeds, and tragic departures from the pavement.\n\nIt is a folly compounded when youths gather in packs, the presence of peers acting like tinder to their impulsive fires. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, in its cold arithmetic, reveals the tight bond between the age of passengers and the surge in traffic calamities. In response, California and its kin have erected barriers in the form of provisional licenses, curbing the hours and the company young drivers may keep.\n\nYet these measures, though well-meaning, seem but patches on a fraying quilt. The heart of the matter is that the youngest among us are ill-equipped for the burden of the wheel, as all evidence testifies. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, standing like a prophet in the wilderness, voices that even at eighteen, the mind may yet crave the thrill of risk. USA Today echoes his research, suggesting that this thirst for sensation does not truly abate until the cusp of twenty. Thus, it seems prudent to delay the bestowal of full driving privileges until this wild yearning finds its ebb.\n\nShould we persist in our current course, the road ahead is fraught with the certainty of rising tolls. The children of the Baby Boomers will soon flood the driver's ranks, and the highways shall teem with their numbers. By 2010, a legion of new drivers will rise, a prospect that looms large with peril.\n\nThe path to remedy is as clear as it is necessary. Let the schools continue to sow the seeds of knowledge through driver's education, but hold the reins of power until the age of eighteen. Allow provisional permits, yet demand a testament of practical hours behind the wheel, perhaps mirroring the tally of states like California, with its call for six hours in instruction and fifty in supervised practice. Across this vast land, let there be a unified decree, a national safeguard to shield our youth from the harsh lessons of the road.\n\nThis proposition is no new revelation, but rather a call to reason in the face of gathering shadows.",
            "In those quiet corridors of sound and silence, where the mind seeks to make sense of the world it hears, there lies a disorder as elusive as the whispers of the wind through barren branches. They call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder, CAPD, a specter of the auditory realm where the central nervous system falters in its duty to decipher the voices of the world. Herein, I shall lay bare its nature, its signs, and the ways in which a teacher might guide a child through the labyrinth of sound that is their classroom.\n\nCAPD, a name that speaks with the authority of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, marks a failure not of the ears but of the brain itself, a chaos in the kingdom of the mind where sounds are gathered and given meaning. It is not a deafness of the ears, for those afflicted hear as well as any other. It is the brain's inability to weave the tapestry of noise into the coherent cloth of understanding, where words are jumbled and conversations lost amid the clamor of the world.\n\nIn the annals of history, as early as the mid-1950s, the disorder found its first appellation, \"auditory imperception.\" It was then the Italian minds of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began their quest to unravel this mystery, crafting tests to probe the minds of children who could not make sense of the sounds they heard. By 1961, Kimura entered the stage, wielding the tool of dichotic testing to chart the physiology of the auditory pathways.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are many and varied, like the facets of a well-cut gem. Those who bear its burden may find themselves adrift in a sea of sound, unable to pinpoint its source or separate its strands. They struggle with the subtle dance of voices, the rise and fall of speech that conveys more than mere words. One sound may drown another, a cacophony of meaning lost. Patterns and sequences dissolve into the ether, leaving naught but confusion in their wake.\n\nTo unveil this disorder, one must observe, like a tracker in the wild, the behavior of the afflicted. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, with their battalion of tests and measures, seek to tease apart the threads of auditory skill. Yet no single test stands as a beacon of clarity, no cause can be pinned as the culprit. A patient is presented with a symphony of sounds, tasked with the impossible—to sift through the noise and find the melody. Advanced tests delve deeper, capturing the echoes within the ear, seeking the truth in the signals’ reply.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves at the edge of understanding, peering into the void where sound and silence meet, and where the mind struggles to make sense of it all.",
            "In the pursuit of knowledge and the solemn duty of social work, my path is drawn toward the Division of Family and Children Services, where the wounded children of the world await the healing touch of those who would stand against the dark shadows of neglect and abuse. The craft of my intent is girded by values worn like armor: the service rendered, the respect earned, the ethics held high, and the unwavering resolve to mend the frayed bonds between souls. These are not mere tenets of the trade but echoes of my own heart's longing.\n\nOnce, I wandered that uncertain road, the way forward obscured by youth's indecision. High school and those early college days were a theater of flight and denial, where I bore witness to the human condition's frailty. It was the fall of 2009 when I left Piedmont College with a Psychology degree in hand, yet still adrift. A summer's day found me at a friend's door, where a boy of sixteen sat, bound in the silence of fear. His tale was one of escape, a flight from hands meant to cradle, not harm. The law, blind in its own way, offered no balm, and so I took it upon myself to speak with those who had birthed him. In their eyes, I saw a nervous dance of words, a litany of excuses for their son's cries for help. It was this encounter that lit the fire within me, a call to the blood to enter the realm of social work, to untangle the so-called \"simple\" disputes that weave through the fabric of family.\n\nJustice, too, is a pillar of this calling. In this world, we speak of the individual with reverence, yet we bind ourselves with the chains of conformity. I have never been one to wear such shackles. My rebellion against injustice is painted in the colors of my hair, the piercings that adorn me, and the clothes that speak my truth. I stood with the GSBA, I stood against the scourge of racism, and I will continue to stand, a solitary figure against the tide of sameness. For justice is a flame that must be fed, and I am its keeper.",
            "In the vast and shadowed corridors of human understanding, we find a paper that seeks to delve into the intricate webs of the Biological and Sociocultural models as they intertwine with the restless specter of insomnia. Herein lies the biological model, its gaze fixed upon the whispered secrets of our genetic lineage and the steadfast march of medical science. In contrast, the Sociocultural models cast their net wide, ensnaring the myriad tapestries of environment and their dance with race, ethnicity, and the arbitrations of society's structures. The examination that follows endeavors to unravel these models, illuminating each chosen piece of research as a beacon to clarify and expand upon these frameworks. The findings, though unveiled, are not beyond critique, as their strengths and frailties are laid bare.\n\nIn the realm of sleep, disorders stand as sentinels at the gates of rest, categorizing themselves as either primary afflictions of sleep, companions to other mental specters, or as echoes of deeper maladies. The primary disorders, known as Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, walk hand in hand with those that dwell in the shadows of Axis I or Axis II disorders. Yet others arise from the treacherous tides of medical complication or the siren call of substance. Within the Dyssomnias, we find Primary Insomnia, a foe to restful slumber, while Primary Hypersomnia stands as its mirror image, a challenge to the waking world. Narcolepsy, with its sudden surrender to cataplexy and the unbidden arrival of REM, joins this procession. Parasomnias, on the other hand, speak of nightmares and terrors, of somnambulistic wanderings, and of the unspeakable. This exploration turns its eye to insomnia, and by extension, the broader landscape of primary sleep disorders, through the lens of biological and sociocultural paradigms.\n\nThe biological model peers into the heart of sleep disorders, tracing their lineage through the genes and heritable factors, marking the physiological territories they claim. In the shadowed recesses of the hypothalamus, neurons bearing the standard of orexin govern the fragile balance of sleep and wakefulness. Through the lens of experimentation upon mice, the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors upon these neurons is revealed, arbiters of the sleep-wake states. The GABAA receptor's activation whispers the promise of sleep, while its silence courts anxiety and restlessness, yet the GABAB agonist, baclofen, extends the mantle of slumber (Matsuki et al., 2009). These revelations hint at a genetic and environmental foundation for the GABAB receptor's role in the human condition. A deficiency or absence of this receptor might lead to a restless exile from sleep's embrace, bereft of medicinal aid. The sociocultural tapestry weaves a tale of inherited phenotypes, where alterations in the receptor's form could rend the fabric of one's sleep, casting shadows across the daily journey through school, career, and the mundane trials that demand unwavering focus.",
            "For these two and a half years, four and a half semesters as they reckon it, I have walked the paths of University Park. A place sprawling and vast where to traverse from East Halls, where they set me down in my freshman year, across to Willard in the heart of it all, could take up to a quarter of an hour or more. The sky often darkened and brooding, the air thick with the promise of rain or snow, State College weather indifferent to the plight of its wanderers. An alum, not much older, told me once of the days when East Halls were remote, set apart by fields empty and unclaimed, now replaced by sports grounds, looming structures both of brick and steel, the Creamery and a health services edifice among them. The campus, ever expanding, maketh the journey longer and harder. \n\nIn this world, the bicycle stands as salvation. Not the machine alone, but its rider, and a campus molded to its wheels. A friend, who had taken up cycling once more after years of neglect, told me of his rediscovered faith. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"once deemed uncool yet now the only way forward.\" His words echo true. Bicycling is a testament to efficiency, a bowl of oats and effort enough to take you miles. Now living off campus as many do, I find myself no closer than those dorm years past. A bike I did buy, the wisest choice made. The trek to Thomas building, otherwise a long and weary walk, now a mere five minutes if I push hard. Yet Pollock Road, the road of choice, is not always a simple path. \n\nWalking has its virtues, yet time is the master I serve. Without my bike, walking would be my only lot, a luxury I cannot afford. To Thomas and back each day would rob me of half an hour or more, hours within the week I do not possess. Time, a harsh steward, demands more than I can give.",
            "In the dark terrain of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" there lies a silent indictment of the relentless march of technology and the cold machinery of capitalism that underpins it. A dystopia unfolds where the collective is exalted above the solitary soul, and from their first breath, the people are groomed to chase ephemeral joy, their lives a ceaseless pursuit of the next fleeting pleasure. They are but pawns on a vast board, their paths dictated by the unseen hand of the World Controller. Through the prism of Marxist theism, one discerns Huxley's quiet unease, a suspicion of the systems that rise like dark monoliths against the horizon of his time. Marxist whispers of homogeny and reification echo through the tale, a testament to Huxley's critique of the burgeoning economic order.\n\nWithin this satire of capitalism lies the specter of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis that ensnares the common folk, blinding them to the true nature of their bonds with those who toil alongside them. Their desires, their ambitions, all shaped by unseen forces, are but reflections of their own self-interest, a result of the ideological chains that bind the proletariat. In \"Brave New World,\" this control is plain to see, inscribed in the very conditioning that molds the Deltas and Gammas. They wander through life without true volition, their minds sculpted by hypnopædia to consume, to spend, to indulge. The World Controller's hand guides them deftly, a puppet master unseen. Hegemony, the dominance of one class by another, is the silent architect of their fate. The lower classes, blind to their manipulation, partake in an ideology that props up the edifice of capitalism and consumerism, unaware of the chains they bear. Even the Alphas and Betas, aware yet indifferent, seldom rise above their ordained roles, save for the likes of Bernard who dare to question. In the interplay of social strata lies a somber reflection of capitalism's perceived oppression.\n\nIn this world, true connections are but a mirage. The novel draws no distinction among its populace, even its principal players are bereft of depth, shadows cast upon the wall. Huxley perhaps suggests that in the union of technology and capitalism, man is stripped of his agency and voice. Love, that most profound of emotions, is absent, as are the extremities of feeling; interactions are mere shadows on the surface, evident in the men's superficial appraisals of women, reduced to their pneumatic allure, and the women's unreserved recounting of their liaisons. The unquestioning acceptance of each class in the societal order mirrors the capitalist impact on the soul. Their unwavering adherence to their roles in the grand design speaks to the Marxist view of the proletariat, deceived into believing their supremacy, as long as they continue to consume, to conform, to walk in step with their brethren.",
            "It was near four years past when I found myself in the halls of CBC, enrolling in a course on Islam. The room, charged with fervor, turned often to the debate on whether Islam holds hostility at its core. This query, it seems, swells in significance with each passing year. In the shadow of that day in September, I have watched the shifting tide of mass media's gaze. Once, it bore a scornful eye upon Islam, yet now it seems to bend toward a curious tolerance within the American landscape. Such a time, back in 2001, seemed unlikely for a man like Barack Obama, whose name alone whispered of a Muslim lineage, to vie for the highest office in the land.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as told in biography, captivates me still. For what I have gathered of Muhammad's historical saga contradicts those words. I had held the belief that Muhammad wielded force in spreading the faith, that he overtook tribes and imposed Islam upon them. Yet the biography paints him as a martyr, a figure misread, who lowered himself in humility before others. In this telling, his teachings shone like a beacon, drawing seekers to him, one soul at a time.\n\nThere are echoes too, between Christ and Muhammad, in the tales of their deeds. Most striking is that of the mutton and milk, multiplied for forty men. Such writing aims to cast Muhammad in the light of a humble prophet, whose life was steeped in truth and miracles that needed no heralding. This, to me, is a perilous fallacy, for it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ. It is as if they seek to borrow from the legacy of Jesus, to fashion Muhammad in a similar mold.\n\nWithin the biography's pages, stories abound that seem intent on proving conversion to Islam as a spontaneous, witnessed truth. Yet these accounts often drift through third-hand tellings, a trail of whispers through unnamed voices. This weakens their claim, casting shadows of doubt upon the tales they mean to affirm.\n\nWhat unsettles me most is the portrayal of Muhammad as a godly man, adorned with humility and wisdom. History’s account stands at odds with this image of gentleness. And I wonder if those who follow Islam today understand the true nature of Muhammad’s ascent to power.",
            "In the dust and shadows of history, there was a man who walked the earth with teachings that burned bright for a time and then were left behind, eclipsed by the forward march of doctrines and edicts that bore his name but not always his spirit. The story of Christianity is one that ebbed and flowed, a river of belief carving new paths, straying farther from the headwaters of its origin. And here we stand, in a world shaped by the hands of progress, where the old and the new clash like titans. The traditional ones, rooted deep in their certainties, resist the winds of change. Yet the tide of history is a force relentless. Among the faithful, a stirring begins, a quiet murmur of awakening that will swell to a roar. A yearning to peel back the layers of time, to glimpse the face of the man they call Jesus, unadorned by the trappings of centuries. It is a path long and winding, a journey that may span decades or even centuries, but it is a path that must be walked. For the pendulum of time swings ever back, and the church, that grand old ship, will sail with it, stripped of its barnacles, towards the simplicity of its inception. \n\nThe world will see a strange thing, a reversion, as if the clock itself had turned its face to the past. Denominations and divisions, those walls built by human hands, will crumble into dust. The tapestry of Christendom, once vibrant with colors and patterns of diversity, will be woven anew with threads of unity. It is a tale as old as time—empires rise and fall, the persecuted become the powerful. The land of the free, that once knew the chains of slavery, now stands with leaders born of those who were once bound. And so it will be with the faith that bears the mark of the cross. The great reversion will sweep through the churches of the West, a reclamation of the past, a return to the source. \n\nBut to walk this path, the words of Jesus must be read not as edicts carved in stone but as stories whispered on the wind, metaphors dancing in the firelight. For what is it that has transpired since the man from Nazareth walked the earth? In the beginning, there was only the people of the covenant, the children of Israel. A single God looked down upon them, a divine whisper in the wilderness. By the time the Romans cast their shadow over Jerusalem, the Jews had splintered into factions—the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, and the common folk who walked the roads between. And from these roots sprang a faith that would shake the world, a faith that must now find its way back to the garden.",
            "In the deep recesses of the human soul, there lies a darkness, a greed, a self-centeredness that The Jungle lays bare. Here is the tale of men who care nothing for their fellows, those who strive only for their own prosperity while the world beneath them withers. Upton Sinclair paints this canvas with the owners and overseers of those vast factories, their gaze fixed solely on the growth and grandeur of their enterprises. Their eyes are blind to the lives they trample, the lives consumed by their relentless advance. The line of buildings stands stark against the sky, chimneys reaching heavenward, dispensing their blackened breath across the earth, a testament to the desolation wrought by the uncaring hand of progress. Sinclair's words show a world where the great smoke rivers and waste runoff poison the land and its creatures, yet the masters of these edifices remain indifferent to the ruin they sow.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the workers toil, mere cogs in the machinery of wealth. For the few coins saved, the masters would sacrifice a multitude. From top to bottom, the enterprise is a cauldron of envy and spite, devoid of loyalty, a place where humanity is weighed against the dollar and found wanting. Hours stretch unending, and without a whisper of warning, they are cast aside, left to fend for themselves in a world without mercy. The time of The Jungle knew little of law or protection for those who labored, and thus the overseers drove their workers mercilessly, heedless of the wretched conditions imposed upon them. No words are spoken of it, yet the truth is laid bare; those who labored and died in Packingtown bore their burden in silence, with no refuge from the squalor of their labor or their lives. No agency nor savior was there to guide these lost souls, and though unions rose from their ranks, they too were wolves in sheep's clothing, profiting from the very ones they claimed to protect. In this place, men were bound as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In the dusky corridors of literature, there stands the figure of Edgar Allan Poe, his pen a whisper in the gathering gloom. Among his creations, \"Dream-Land\" lays claim to a peculiar foreboding, a self-proclaimed beacon of his poetic prowess. It is here that Poe summons the specter of \"Thulé,\" a word that Mabbott, like a patient archaeologist, traces back to Virgil's hand. Virgil, who spoke of an isle beyond Britain’s shores, where the world’s map unwound into the unknown. Yet, the echoes of \"Thulé\" do not end in antiquity. They find voice anew in the Germanic echoes that stirred Poe’s soul.\n\nIn the shadowed recesses of Poe’s mind, Goethe's specter lingers, a testament to affinities unspoken. Karl J. Arndt, in his scholarly tome, draws lines between Poe's verse and Goethe's song, suggesting an imitation that is less mimicry than homage. Goethe, the bard of \"Faust,\" whose drama was birthed in two acts, the first in 1808, and the second, an elegy in the year of his death, 1832. Within \"Faust's\" twilight verse lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of loss and desolation. A king, haunted by the ghost of a queen, driven to drink and despair, casting his last keepsake into the sea before he too succumbs to the void.\n\nThe king in Goethe’s poem and the specter in Poe’s \"Dream-Land\" seem reflections in a darkened mirror, each a shadow of Poe’s own lamentations. The drink, the loss, the burden of memory—these are the threads that weave their tapestry across the chasm of time. In the year 1842, a scant breath before Poe's invocation of Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" Grattan recast \"Faust\" into a drama of romance, igniting anew the flames of Goethe’s influence.\n\nTwice Poe whispers of Thule in his collected works, his voice a distant echo. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" \"ultima Thule\" becomes the boundary of despair, while in \"Dream-Land,\" it is both the beginning and the end. The landscape of Thule is painted with shadows, a desolate echo of Goethe’s king, bereft and adrift in a colorless purgatory. It is as if Poe has stepped into Goethe's world, finding there a kindred darkness.\n\nGoethe’s presence in Poe's world is undeniable, a shadow cast long and deep by the reverberations of Tennyson's admiration. In the echoes of Tennyson’s praise, Poe found the call of Goethe’s work, resonant in the myriad reproductions that followed the original publication, each a stone cast into the literary waters, rippling outward toward eternity.",
            "In the lawbound expanse of California, where the sun bakes the earth and men grapple with consequence, a question arises. Could one, having slipped upon a spill of applesauce in a grocery store, find justice in the form of punitive riches, claiming the storekeeper turned a blind eye with malice nesting in his heart, having twice heard of the mess and left it unattended while he dined? The judge, solemn and inscrutable, may not cast aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive redress. To carve out such a claim, evidence must be laid bare that the store’s keeper had acted with willful neglect, conscious of the harm his inaction might unleash, and that his deeds carried the stench of the despicable. Palmer might just weave her tale with the thread of Martin’s knowing. How he, like a man deaf to warnings, ignored the peril of the slick floor despite the injuries of others who fell before her. A tale of neglect, woven with the threads of prior mishaps, five in number, marking the year of our Lord two thousand and nine. \n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, as the clock marked five in the evening, young Rich Wayne, keeper of aisles, spoke to Paul Martin, his superior, of applesauce spilled. Martin, engrossed in his repast, dismissed the tidings with a wave, claiming no time for the grievances of the shopping folk. A quarter hour passed, another voice, that of Mary J. Haddigan, echoed the warning, only to meet the same indifference. At half past five, the fates conspired, and Palmer, her steps unsteady, found herself upon the floor, her back bearing the brunt of misfortune. She now seeks recompense and punishment for her suffering, and the deliberation turns to whether to contest her claim for punitive relief. \n\nIn the sun-drenched realm of California, the law speaks of punitive recompense for breaches not born of contract, where the defendant’s actions bear the mark of “oppression, fraud, or malice.” So it is writ in Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice, the code declares, is a deed either meant to harm or one so vile it defies intent, carried out with conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. In the annals of law, deeds earn the label of malice when the perpetrator, aware of the peril his actions portend, chooses willfully to walk the path of neglect, as noted in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always carried within her a yearning, a want that lay like a stone in the gut, unyielding and unfulfilled. It had begun its quiet existence when she was but fourteen, stepping into the uncertain corridors of her teenage years. And there it remained, steadfast and unrelenting, even as she stood on the cusp of seventeen. In the passage of those years, she discerned that it was not a thing she sought but a someone, yet the boys who circled her world failed to stir her heart. They had tried, some driven by the hopeful folly of youth to sway the unswayable, yet none could hold her gaze. She wondered at this, questioning the strange emptiness that lay within her, pondering what manner of mystery it was that held her separate from the common desires of her age. Her ruminations, spanning years, had conjured theories but none that could satisfy the gnawing question. And so, she moved through life, ever questioning the nature of her desire.\n\nHer home was a place of peace, a sanctuary marked by the quietude of her parents, who were good and steady folk. Their lives were seldom marred by discord, and arguments with their daughter were a rare occurrence. The only friction arose from her burgeoning independence, her spirit unfurling like a banner against the calm backdrop of their lives. She was their daughter, yet her vibrant nature was a counterpoint to their serene existence, a testament to her kindness and the light she carried within.\n\nYet today, the calm was shattered. As she wandered from room to room, seeking some muse for her restless heart, a sharp cry reached her from the kitchen, her mother's voice cleaving the air. Panic set her to motion, her feet carrying her swiftly to the source of the sound. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried, her voice edged with fear. There lay her mother, crumpled upon the floor, her breath coming in pained gasps, each exhalation a whispered \"Ow.\" The daughter knelt beside her, hands gentle and seeking to aid. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her words were forced, squeezed between the shards of pain, and her daughter knew the urgency was real. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother guided her, and in that moment, the daughter felt a surge of gratitude for the strength she had honed. Carefully, she lifted her mother, bore her to the car, and laid her in the back before setting out for the hospital.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a place thick with the scent of antiseptic and the quiet hum of fear. But her senses were dulled to such things, her mind tethered to the singular focus of aiding her mother. She carried her swiftly inside, her voice rising to call for the attention of those who could help. Faces turned towards her, concern etched in their lines, and a bed was swiftly brought forth to bear her mother away. They whisked her into the depths of the hospital, and the daughter was left to wait, her heart heavy with worry.\n\nIt was a fall from a stepping stool, an ascent made in pursuit of a vase perched high in the cabinet, that had felled her mother so.",
            "In the silence of the study, figures and lives lay etched upon the paper like the dust of time. Here was the tale spun from the Mediterranean sun, a diet rich in the earth's bounty, its fruits and grains and nuts, a testament to the ancient ways. They called it the aMed diet, a variant of the old world’s sustenance, marked by its embrace of plant over beast, the lean flesh of fish, and the oil of the olive, shunning the saturated fats that spoke of indulgence. A draught of wine was not forbidden.\n\nThe past had whispered of this diet's promise, of lives prolonged and hearts spared from the ravages of disease. Yet the specter of stroke and its deadly claim had not been fully reckoned in these tales. Here now was a gathering of women, 74,886 strong, ranging from the ages of 38 to 63, their lives woven into the fabric of a grand design, the Nurses' Health Study. From 1984 to 2004, six times over, they bared their habits upon the scrolls of food frequency questionnaires.\n\nTheir stories were not left to chance. More than 95 percent stayed the course through these years. Their accounts were checked against the grim tally of medical records and death's own papers. Some tales were left to the realm of the probable, yet still they were heeded, numbers given voice in the absence of certainty.\n\nTo temper the whims of chance and capture truth from the passing years, scores were tallied, averaged over time. The shadows of confounding truths were cast aside, adjusted for age, and the many facets of living—smoking, body mass, the ebb and flow of hormones, and the elixir of multivitamins. Even the vigor of their days was counted from 1986 onward.\n\nIn the end, the numbers spoke. The path of the aMed diet bore fruit in the reduction of heart's malady and the silent thief, stroke. Across two decades, 2391 tales of heart's strife and 1763 of stroke were recorded, while the shadow of death claimed 1077 lives. For those who followed the diet most faithfully, the risks were lessened, a relative risk of 0.71 whispered to those in the lowest quarter.\n\nThus was the story told, of the Mediterranean's promise carried across the oceans to these women, the legacy of ancient wisdom, its truth laid bare in the numbers.",
            "The sign stood there in the dim light as if it were some ancient relic unearthed in the heart of a city unyielding to time. Hitler is alive in Burma, it declared in stark black letters. A girl stood beneath it, Ellen Page they called her, once the star of a film named Juno, a solitary figure on a street corner of this world. Her hands clasped the cardboard where the haunting words lay inscribed with the indelible mark of a Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar as they sometimes call it, a land in the clutches of a ruthless junta that seized power in the year of our Lord 1962 through the cold machinations of a coup d’état.\n\nIn the year 2007, the streets bore witness to an uprising not seen in a decade. Monks, draped in robes of saffron, took to those streets and gave name to the revolution. Their chants and prayers rising into the ether, the Saffron Revolution it came to be known. The people, stirred by the courage of the monks, found their voices and joined the march. At first, the government watched the gatherings with disdainful eyes but allowed them to persist. Soon enough, it spiraled into violence, the monks and the junta locked in a struggle that bore the bitter taste of war. The military stormed monasteries, leaving ruin in their wake. Journalists from foreign lands became prisoners, their freedom a distant memory. A man named Kenji Nagai, a lensman from the land of the rising sun, fell on the streets on the twenty-seventh day of September for the crime of witness.\n\nThe official tally told of thirteen souls lost, but a man named Colonel Hla Win, who broke ranks and spoke out, whispered of thousands who had perished, their bodies hidden from the world’s eyes.\n\nSuch tales are old as time itself. The lust for power and the silencing of dissent have shadowed human civilization since its dawn. Emperors of Rome proclaimed themselves chosen by the heavens to wield absolute power. In Japan, emperors were deemed divine, sent to guide their people through the tides of time. Across the seas, a president named George W. Bush sought counsel from Ted Haggard, the voice of those they called the Stupid People Worldwide, a faction of the Republic Party.\n\nHistory is littered with echoes of such darkness. In 1989, in a place called Tiananmen Square, a gathering of students and workers and thinkers stood against the iron hand of authority. Their numbers fell to the ground, the truth of their loss hidden in the shadows of conflicting accounts. The genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s, where the Hutu, with government aid, unleashed death upon the Tutsi and any who sought moderation. And the world still shudders at the memory of the Third Reich, when lands across Europe were soaked in the blood of innocents, for they were deemed unworthy by a man whose name the sign now bore.\n\nThese tales, these truths, they linger in the air like the scent of smoke from a fire long extinguished yet never truly gone.",
            "In the vast expanse of jazz, Duke Ellington carved his legacy as a man who understood the flow of time and the subtle power of sound. His orchestra was a canvas upon which he painted with the deft strokes of a composer who knew the weight of silence and the strength of a single note. The piano, his quiet companion, whispered in his compositions, but it was through his orchestration that Ellington truly spoke. His works were intricate tapestries woven from the threads of individual talents, each musician a color in his grand design. He built spaces where soloists roamed free, yet always within the embrace of a tightly knit framework. In this, he found a way to let the orchestra sing as one, its voice unique to each piece, a testament to his genius.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary holds up Creole Love Call as a moment in time where Ellington turned voice into instrument, casting it into the flow of jazz. Without words, the voice added texture, a color that deepened the whole. In this slow, deliberate blues, Ellington's genius lay in his ability to mirror the style of his soloists, a skill that danced through his career like a shadow. Six choruses unfold, each a testament to his craft:\nThe first chorus, a call and response, voice and reeds entwined, begins smooth as a river before the current shifts to rougher waters.\nThen the trumpet, muted, sings a melody that bends and sways with the blue notes.\nA clarinet soars in the third, its high register backed by the whisper of syncopated piano.\nThe fourth chorus echoes the first, the full band rising in a brass and reed dialogue.\nThe fifth reaches a climax, a call and response that climbs to the heavens, lifted by the brass and rhythm's syncopated heartbeat.\nFinally, the sixth returns to the beginning, voice and reeds speaking in growls, the voice now an instrument in its own right.\nA brief tag ends it all, a vocal run and a trombone's dissonant farewell.\n\nEllington's use of voice added a hue to his work, a stylistic thread that ran deep. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year hence, his mastery of orchestration and tone color shone bright. A dialogue between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blurred the line between voice and instrument, crafting a sound both rich and whole. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) carried these ideas forward, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone leading the way into the melody's heart. Ellington's orchestra, his creation, swung with a life all its own.",
            "In the vast and unyielding theater of life, one might ponder the reasons why creatures shift and change in the manner that they do. What unseen chains bind them, directing the course of their transformation through time’s relentless passage? As early as 1917, D’Arcy Thompson mused that “Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” a sentiment that echoes through the present age. In recent years, an attempt has been made to apply the rigors of mathematical modeling to the arc of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing the lineage both through the life of the individual and the lineage of its kind (see Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our inquiry ventures into this realm, employing mathematical constructs alongside experimental endeavors to unravel the mysteries of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. Through the lens of X-radiography, we have sought to distill the essence of these creatures, extracting parameters to simulate their form, both imagined and real. Into the alchemy of software named CerioShell (Stone, 1995), these parameters were cast, conjuring shells of hypothetical morphology that mark the borders of conceivable change in Prunum. Such findings are married with experimental and descriptive studies to cast light upon the grand tapestry of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nConsider the shell, a winding structure that charts its existence in a spiral dance through the corridors of time and space. These turns, these revolutions of a coiled shell, are known as whorls, spiraling around a phantom axis that threads its way through the shell’s core, the columella. The expansion of whorls is a variable thing, marked by a slender line of division known as the suture. In most shells, the grandest whorl is the last, the body whorl. All preceding it belong to the spire, with the apex crowning the spire’s peak, and its opposite end termed the base. Through the aperture, the creature within emerges into the world.\n\nA shell may be viewed from multiple angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. And yet, the conventional stance is apertural, with the aperture facing forward, apex reaching for the sky.\n\nTo count whorls, one begins with an apical view, seeking the birth of the first suture. A line is drawn, slicing the shell into two halves. From this line, whorls are counted, measured to the quarter.\n\nThe shell’s form is a sequence of apertures, a journey through temporal and spatial dimensions as the creature builds its home. The path of the aperture can be traced by the center coordinates of each whorl’s aperture and its radii, horizontal and vertical. \n\nThis trajectory is not only a thing to be seen but one to be captured in the language of math. Once captured, the parameters may be altered, the skeletogenesis of the mollusk modified, a testament to the dance of numbers and nature.",
            "In the archipelago of Indonesia, the shadows of mortality cast long and unchanging over the tender lives of the newborn and the very young. A decade has passed and the numbers stand defiant, unmoved. The nation strides the path of many a Millennium Development Goal, the waters cleansed, the sanitation improved, yet the specter of child and maternal health looms still, untouched by the winds of progress needed to reach the fabled goals of 2015. The roots of this stagnation are myriad and entwined, and they tell a tale of a health system in need of fortification, a shift from fleeting programmatic interventions to foundations strong and enduring.\n\nUpon the land, some progress is etched in the sand. Seventy-two in every hundred births now witness the presence of skilled hands, though the term is broad and inclusive of those traditional midwives whose skillset halts at the threshold of complication. Thus, hemorrhage looms large, a grim reaper at the gates of life. The numbers tell a story, yet deceive, for the progress is but skin-deep and the journey yet long. Furthermore, the children, under five and struck by the scourge of diarrhea, find less solace in the hands of a professional healer than before. The tale of postnatal care is one unwritten, incomplete, yet the whispers speak of neglect and lowly rates across the land.\n\nIn the realm of Cesarean births, the numbers are stark, a meager 4% where more should stand. The divide yawns wide, urban settings claiming 7%, rural a paltry 2%, a testament to the chasm of equity that cleaves the country in twain. Access, a cruel mistress, favors the cities and shuns the country fields. The poor, burdened by the weight of cost, find the gates of healthcare closed, a gap of 27% between the richest and the poorest, a tale of disparity and woe.\n\nAs the nation ponders the path ahead for the care of mother and child, a question lingers, unyielding: how best to bridge the chasm of service? Shall the path be one of programmatic focus, or shall the health system be fortified in its entirety, casting a wide net over pre and postnatal care? The allure of targeted interventions beckons, their aims clear, their results swift. Yet beware, for the price is steep. The focus on one may leave others barren, resources drawn to the flame of funding, as the family planning sector learned under the shadow of HIV/AIDS. Parallel programs spawn duplication, uncoordinated, a tangle of forms and papers, a bureaucratic mire.\n\nThus the way is fraught, the journey long, and the choices many. Yet the path must be chosen, for the lives of the young and their mothers call out from the shadows, in need of light.",
            "In the long passage of a century, popular music has unfurled its banners to include a legion of genres sprawling across the landscape, each a tributary of sound and rhythm that defies cataloging, a wild river that knows no bounds. It is a tangled web, this world of music, where even the simplest of tunes finds itself split into myriad subgenres, each a child born of the same primal cadence that echoes through time. Among them stands heavy metal, a colossus of sound that in the past forty years has carved its own path through the wilderness, a path both rugged and expressive, a testament to the myriad shades of the human soul.\n\nHeavy metal, it is said, wears its heart upon its sleeve, its emotions unbridled and raw, a symphony of shadows that dances within the dark recesses of our being. The inception of this genre was but a whisper, yet it grew with a fervor that could not be contained, each branch of its lineage spawning yet another, and so on, until the very notion of what it is became as elusive as smoke on the wind. Today, the tree of heavy metal stands tall and wide, its branches reaching into the heavens, each limb a story of its own, each leaf a note that resonates with those who seek its truth.\n\nThe essence of metal is not merely in its sound but in its very being—a movement rather than a mere genre, a force driven by a darkness that is at once frightening and mesmerizing. It is a music of excess, of more, always more—more bass, more volume, more of everything that pushes the boundaries of what music can be. Those who dwell in its embrace are masters of their craft, wielding their instruments with a prowess that speaks of countless hours spent in pursuit of the perfect note. And yet, this movement, born in part from the haze of psychedelia, carries with it the shadows of its inception—a time when the world turned inward and the music turned outward, reaching for the stars with hands stained by the earth.\n\nIt is a music that revels in its own darkness, a visceral experience that speaks to the core of what it means to be human. It draws from the well of Romanticism, a dark mirror reflecting the soul's deepest yearnings. The lyrics, often dark and foreboding, are the very heart of this movement, a testament to the pain and beauty that coexist within us all.\n\nConsider, if you will, the song \"Helter Skelter,\" a piece from the Beatles that dances on the edge of this abyss, a response to the Rolling Stones that sought to claim the heaviness as their own. It is a song that teeters on the brink of madness, a dance with the devil that echoes through the corridors of time. Within its strains lie the roots of what would become heavy metal, a genre not born of light but of shadow, a testament to the human spirit's unyielding desire to explore the darkness within.",
            "In the quiet years before the Surrealists cast their visions onto canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, moving with a deliberate grace through the landscapes of his own dreamscapes. The Dream, born in 1910 from the hands of this Post-Impressionist, spoke of wonder—a woman adrift in a land not her own but one that lived in the recesses of her dreams. It was more than paint and canvas, it was the very breath of Rousseau himself, each stroke a whisper of his own desires and the shadows of what he sought—recognition, acceptance, the applause of those whose eyes lingered long upon a painting. Yet in his heart there burned a conflict as old as art itself—to follow the well-trodden path of the masters, to echo their voices, or to walk alone, leaving his own marks upon the earth, unique and unchained.\n\nTo truly see The Dream, one must first walk through the life of the man who dreamed it. Born May 21, 1844, in Laval, a place where the sky met the earth in a quiet embrace, Henri Rousseau came into a world where his father, a tinsmith and dealer of hardware, found a certain comfort in the life of the bourgeois (Shattuck 47). No art graced his education; instead, life took him to the service of the toll, a gabelou they called him, though some whispered douanier with a knowing nod (Shattuck 46). Grief walked with him, the loss of his first wife Clémence, and eight children who never breathed but in his heart, leaving him with Julia, a daughter, and a wound that sought solace in the world of paint (Shattuck 49). Unlike those who painted peasants as if through a mist of nostalgia, Rousseau stood as a man of his own kind, a folk artist with dreams as common as the soil beneath his feet.\n\nThe yearning for acceptance, for a nod from the world of art, was a hunger that made sense in the light of his journey. Untrained, he began this path later, surrounded by the brilliance of others who shone so brightly. Long he toiled, and only as Matisse began to rise did the world pause to look at Rousseau. Jan Gordon's words in Modern French Painters tell of this rivalry, a clash not of color or form but of intent: Matisse, who feared the ordinary, and Rousseau, who wished for nothing more than to paint a picture plain enough to earn him a place among the Artiste Français (92).",
            "The old thinkers, the ones who walked the earth and pondered the nature of things, they saw a line drawn betwixt ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty entwined like the roots of some ancient tree. It is a line not so easily unraveled, for at its core there lies a reason, deep and abiding. Keats spoke it plain in his ode, beauty and truth, truth and beauty, all one needs to know in this world. We learn much through the teaching of others, through the school of experience, yet these things of ethics and aesthetics, they come to us unbidden, untaught. They describe the world as it is, not as it should be. In morality and beauty, we seek understanding, not rules. We try to say why a painting moves the heart or why a deed is just, and yet we are left with the unsaid, the ineffable.\n\nWhen we speak of art, of morals, we grasp at shadows. The Mona Lisa stands before us, a woman’s smile painted in oils, and we speak of its parts, the play of light, the shadows cast, the history it bears, but these words fall short. The heart knows more than the tongue can tell. Ask a man his favorite poem and he'll say, there's just something about it. You cannot pin down art or ethics like a butterfly, for they are of the same cloth as the wind. As O'Connor said, a story tells what words cannot alone. Even when the tale is spun, something remains, beyond the grasp of the critic’s pen. Ethics too shares this nature. Wittgenstein saw it clear, ethics cannot be spoken. It is of the world beyond. It is this something, this intangible essence, that binds art and morality together, a thread running through both, unseen yet felt.\n\nMorality and art, they touch us deep down, where the soul resides, in the noumenal realm, as Kant might name it. They strike us hard and true, beyond the reach of reason’s grasp. In literature, this bond is strongest. McKean saw it, the moral heart of the written word. Literature bears upon it the weight of values, like life itself, where music or painting may not. In living, we find values, and in literature, their echo. It matters to us, because there, amidst the ink and paper, we find reflections of our very selves.",
            "In the breadth of today's Germany there lies a power, a unity of land and people shaped by the shadows of the Bavarian Alps and stretching to the windswept shores of the Baltic at Kiel. This land breathes with the pulse of its history, from the banks of the Rhine at Köln to the heartland and onward to the Saxon stone of Dresden by the Elbe. Germany, with its own peculiar culture, is a tapestry woven from disparate threads, tribes long vanished, yet their presence echoing in the very soil.\n\nGermania, cradle of the Germanic soul. The name itself a mystery, a subject of scholarly debates and whispered histories. Tacitus penned the tale of Tungrians, a tribe of old, their name worn like a cloak before they crossed the Rhine to clash with Gaulish warriors. Julius Caesar, chronicler of conquest, first carved \"Germanus\" into his records of the Gallic Wars. He wielded this word to mark those unconquered, those who dared the Rhine's icy embrace under guile's shadow. The Gauls spoke it, distinguishing the wild men beyond their dominion. Some say it named a neighbor in their tongue, others claim it was the spear, the ger, or the clamor, a shout of war, rising from German throats.\n\nTacitus, in his solemn prose, wrote of the Germans in De Origine et situ Germanorum of AD 98. He spoke of a people untainted by foreign blood, untouched by the sea's wanderers. \"Who,\" he asked, \"would forsake Asia or Africa, Italy for this harsh land of Germany, with its fierce clime and stern visage, save for the call of home?\"\n\nAnd who indeed would abandon the splendor of Rome for Germania's wilderness? The Romans would not, not then. They ventured forth, seeking the riches of Germania, yet they returned to their empire's embrace. The Germanic tribes, emerging on the first century's dawn, traded at Rome's borders, bartered their land's bounty, and lent their arms to Rome's legions, a bond forged in necessity. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "In the world of Twelfth Night, disguise is a double-edged sword, a useful tool in weaving the intricate tapestry of deceit, yet a perilous one that can bind the soul to its own shadows. A man or woman must eventually tear off the mask lest they be swallowed whole by its artifice, yet therein lies the crux of the discord: to cast aside the falsehood is to risk the solitude of alienation. One must weigh the self against the fragile threads of human connection, for though some may greet the revelation with indifference, others will find in it a bitter betrayal, a jest too cruel to forgive.\n\nWhen the guise involves the crossing of the gender line, the stakes rise higher. It calls forth questions deep and primal, the chief among them being, why? Why does one cast aside their own skin to wear the garb of another? Take Viola, who cloaks herself in manhood as a shield against the perils of an unknown land: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her ruse, a necessity born of survival, leaves her adrift from the sisterhood that might have been her solace. So adept is she in her role that she becomes the object of Olivia’s misguided affections, mistaking her for Sebastian, and thus entangling herself in the web of love's mistaken identity: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Meanwhile, she must navigate the unspoken longing that simmers between her and Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo the modern eye, Twelfth Night unfolds as a tableau of hidden truths, where deception serves to peel back the layers of the heart’s repression, exposing the tender roots of desire. It stirs the question within Olivia's breast: is her heart drawn to Cesario by the semblance of manhood, or is there a glimmer of something else, a whisper of the unspeakable? Yet, the ease with which she transfers her affections to Sebastian suggests a different tale, one where the heart is swayed by the superficial, a parody of sorts on society's penchant for the skin-deep: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315). Thus, the dance of deception and revelation plays out, a mirror to the desires and duplicities that dwell within us all.",
            "In the austere reaches of German South West Africa, a cruelty was visited upon the land, a scourge that bore the name of empire and left in its wake the bones of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. Yet the expanse of such dominion cannot be so easily measured, for the German colonial empire was a patchwork of policies and terrains as varied as the lands it claimed. In its territories, the fabric of education was woven in many hues. When the British laid their hands upon German East Africa, known as Tanganyika, in the year of 1919, they uncovered a multitude of learned souls, Africans who had been touched by the hand of German pedagogy. In the lands of Kamerun and beyond, the efforts of the Germans found favor in the eyes of those who chronicled such ventures.\n\nBut in the vastness of South West Africa, now called Namibia, there lay a different tale. Here, unlike in East Africa where the state had forged schools and took upon itself the mantle of native education, the task was left to the missionaries. These societies labored with scant support from the government, which instead turned its gaze to the education of its own, crafting a system of state schools for Europeans and tightening its hold upon the missionary institutions. This divergence cast long shadows over South West Africa, shadows that lingered beyond the German reign. Where other colonies could count among their number many who had learned to read and write, in South West Africa the people remained shrouded in ignorance, untouched by the light of education. The reasons for this lay in the tangled roots of society, politics, and economy, a complexity that this discourse seeks to unravel, drawing upon new insights into the settlers and colonial rulers and their views on the native peoples.\n\nThe annals of literature are rich with accounts of German colonial education, penned mostly in that tongue, in the days when the empire still stood. These early works sought to lay bare the nature of the educational practices within the colonies. In later years, the discourse broadened, as English voices entered the fray with comparative studies and deeper examinations of educational nuances. Such works laid bare the disparities between the colonies. Notable among these is Cohen’s study, which peers into the heart of education in South West Africa and East Africa, drawing lines between them and seeking the roots of their differences. Cohen points to the settlers of South West Africa as a key to understanding the educational landscape.\n\nIn comparison to Germany’s other holdings, South West Africa was graced with a climate more forgiving, though much of its expanse was a barren desert. The Europeans were drawn by this kinder clime, and by 1913, their numbers swelled to nearly 15,000, a multitude when set against the mere 5,336 who called East Africa home, the next in line for settler population.",
            "In the dusty annals of time, the tale of two nations unfolds, the United States of America and Mexico, locked in a contest of wills spanning fifty-seven long years, a rivalry that twisted like a river from 1836 to 1893. The war that raged between them took its most furious form in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, a time when the United States, with all the fervor of manifest destiny, descended upon Mexico, wresting from her grasp the lands of Texas and the American Southwest. The echoes of this strife reverberated through the years, a crescendo of conflict that finally dimmed in the shadow of the Great War to come. These two nations, at odds over matters of faith, culture, and the riches of the earth, were no different than many others who find themselves neighbors.\n\nBorders, drawn by the hand of man, are lines that divide yet bind. Nations that share them often find themselves in the throes of contention, bound by the land they inhabit and the interests they hold dear. The tale of America and Mexico is a tale known well in the eternal dance of nations. As David M. Pletcher mused, only in Mexico and Cuba does one find the enduring diplomatic trials that the United States has faced, for these lands lie close, their histories intertwined with that of the American nation, while others in the Latin world have known peace with the eagle to the north.\n\nReligion, that ancient tether of man, cast a shadow between these lands, a shadow that has darkened many a nation’s heart through the ages. As Sally Frahm observed, where once Americans stood against the specters of fascism and communism, in earlier days, their ire was reserved for the papal and the royal. The ideological clash that simmered beneath the surface was not unlike that of the Cold War, yet it was a war of the soul, not of governance, a discord of belief that lingered with the inherited distrust from the colonial past, a barrier to the peace they sought.\n\nSeventeen times, Diehl and Goerts tell us, these nations met in dispute during those fifty-seven years, most over the land and the lawless raids that plagued their borders. Bandits and outlaws, like phantoms of the frontier, made their mark, and it was only through the might of military resolve that peace was wrought upon those restless lands. But as Schmitt recounts, the rivalry waned, for Mexico, in time, found herself tethered to the United States in ways critical and numerous. The American eye turned from conquest to commerce, and the ambitions of expansion gave way to the subtler hand of economic reach in the latter years of that century of change.",
            "Fifteen years back, a shadow fell across my life, an affliction unexpected and unknown, the sort that leaves you grasping in the dark for remnants of the world you thought you knew.\n\nThen I was a nurse, drawn to the vocation out of a yearning for the security and constancy absent from my youth. They said, You'll find work always; sickness is a constant companion in this world. These words, a refrain in my ears through the years of youth and beyond. Thus, the dreams of science and words, the pursuits of the mind, were set aside for the caring of bodies.\n\nAnd there I found myself, at forty-six, alone, the coffers empty and unable to toil. The passage of fifteen years has seen me sustained by Social Security Disability, yet I claim nothing as mine. Survival is a daily skirmish, an unending siege upon my sense of safety and worth. Certainty has abandoned me, save for the truth of kin and comrades who have stood by me. Strength falters in the wake of true calamity, believe me.\n\nEmergencies, they are life's unbidden guests, from the minor to the mighty, and no amount of preparation can shield us from all. The certainty of unpredictability is the only guarantee.\n\nIn this land, the call is often to forsake reliance upon the government, its promise crumbling and corrupt. Yet, I yearn for a people who trust and aid one another, rather than each soul retreating to solitude and self-reliance.\n\nThe myth speaks of rugged individualism, yet our ancestors' survival was not in solitude but in shared burdens, respect, and aid. Those pioneers who faced the Rockies did not reach the sea by standing alone.\n\nSo prepare, as I have. A kit for calamity, with supplies aplenty, from first aid to sustenance and means of light and warmth. If there is soil for sowing and skill for preserving, embrace it. A wood stove is wise, though its wisdom fades in a tenement.\n\nBut as you prepare, reach out. Know those who dwell beside you.",
            "In the ancient mists of time, somewhere in the realm of the fifth or sixth century before the common era, there was born a prince who would be known to the world as Buddha. His journey was one of relinquishment and awakening, and from his teachings sprang forth a way of life, a path known as Buddhism, with its most steadfast followers forming the sect of Theravada. This faith, now stretching across two and a half millennia, has morphed through the ages, its face altered from the visage it bore in the days when Buddha trod the earth. In places like Sri Lanka, where Theravada holds sway, one can witness the annual water-cutting ceremony, a ritual of import to monks and laymen alike, though the Buddha spoke not of such celebrations. These changes, they run deep, from the outward customs to the very heart of the religion's salvific doctrines. The Theravada Buddhist brotherhood, both in the cloister and without, has seen its tenets bend and shift, shaped by forces both from within and without, some in opposition, some indifferent.\n\nThere are terms, distinctions, that shall guide this discourse. The internal and the external. Internal, a force born of those within the Buddhasasana, whether they wear the robes or not. External, a force from beyond the fold, from those who know not the Buddha’s way. Hostile forces, those which strike against the Buddhist kin, born of disregard or enmity. Benign forces, indifferent to the harm or aid they may bring, like a wind that blows without care for the leaves it stirs. These terms will march through our narrative time and again.\n\nTo begin, one must delve into the essence of this faith, the doctrines that form the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. The seekers of this path take sanctuary in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Tripitaka, the three great baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka, where the Suttas lie; the Vinaya Pitaka, home of the rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, keeper of the metaphysical truths. Within these truths are Anatta, the absence of self; Dukkha, the suffering inherent in existence; Anicca, the impermanence of all. Only in the understanding of these can the endless cycle of death and rebirth, Sansara, be brought to its end. With it shall cease lobha, dosa, and moha—desire, hatred, and delusion—upon reaching enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the way of life, with five precepts for the laymen (to refrain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxication) and many more for the monks. The most fundamental of teachings, the four noble truths, begin with Dukkha, the acknowledgment of life’s suffering. Next, the truth that attachment begets suffering. Finally, the truth that this suffering can indeed be surmounted."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the vast and boundless theater of human discourse, culture stands as a silent arbiter, shaping the contours of understanding between men. It is a shadow, defined as much by its absence as by its presence, elusive and intangible, a tapestry woven from myriad threads of tradition and belief. Culture is not a monolith, not a singular creed, but rather a mosaic of differing hues, each piece a testament to the complexity of human experience. To say that all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese compliant is to paint with a brush too broad and too unseeing. The discerning negotiator knows that beneath the surface of such generalizations lies the true essence of a people, and it is this essence that must be grasped if one is to navigate the currents of negotiation with any hope of success.\n\nTo approach a foreign culture is to stand at the threshold of an unknown land, where the familiar is rendered strange and comparisons rise unbidden to the mind. In seeking to understand the hearts and minds of others, one must delve into the annals of their history, uncover the biases that shape their view of the world. Yet judgment must be set aside, for to change a culture is beyond the ken of any man; one must accept it as it is, and learn to move within its bounds, especially when one's own position is fraught with weakness. When treading upon foreign soil, a respect for customs and beliefs is the balm that soothes the wounds of misunderstanding and paves the way to accord.\n\nCulture is a hydra-headed beast, not confined to the borders of nations but thriving within the walls of corporations. Each company, a microcosm unto itself, cultivates its own ethos, some demanding ceaseless toil, others embracing a more languid pace. The fabric of corporate culture is visible in the garb of its denizens, in the tenor of their speech, in the manner by which tasks are apportioned. Philanthropy may be lauded or constrained within the bounds of sanctioned benevolence. The diversity of American enterprise is a testament to the variegated nature of thought that dwells within the societal sphere, a reminder that beneath a seemingly uniform exterior lies a world of difference.\n\nYet beyond the tapestry of culture lies the bedrock of values, the sacred why that governs the conduct of men. In a world where honor and harmony are held in esteem, no man will cast aspersions upon his kin to gain advantage at the negotiating table. Conversely, in lands where the hard bargain is king, a swift settlement is not always the sought-after prize. Understanding these truths is the key that unlocks the door to fruitful negotiation. But beyond the general lies the specific, for it is in knowing the man across the table, in discerning the contours of his soul, that one finds the path to success.",
            "In the quiet corridors of the mind where the echoes of ancient texts murmur and fade, a fool may whisper to himself that there is no God. So begins the Psalm, a lamentation of disbelief, which St. Anselm seizes upon to lay the foundation of his argument for the divine. He speaks not alone, for beside him in this discourse stands Thomas Aquinas, a man of reason and learned ways. Both hold fast to the conviction, the unyielding belief in the God of scripture, and it is our task to weigh their words, to measure their arguments against each other in the crucible of thought. And so we start, accepting as they do, the presence of this God, without which their words would be as dust, scattered and unanchored. Yet for all their certainties, neither offers us a complete tapestry of belief, a seamless cloak of understanding.\n\nAnselm turns inward, seeking the divine in the recesses of the soul, for he argues that God resides within our understanding, unbanishable by mere denial. In the labyrinthine passages of his reasoning, he suggests that proof of God is inscribed upon the mind itself, needing no foreign corroboration. This is faith, he tells us, the acceptance of truth unseen, a concept woven into the fabric of Christian doctrine.\n\nAquinas, however, walks a different path, one paved with the stones of reason and evidence. He would see God proven by the world itself, a revelation not of faith alone but of logical certainty. For the purpose of bringing others to belief, Aquinas offers not the elusive promise of faith, but the firm ground of reason, so that even the skeptic may find purchase. His five proofs stand as sentinels: the unmoved mover, the first cause, the necessary being, the gradation of beauty, and the order of the cosmos. In each, he finds a necessity for God, a piece of the puzzle unseen yet undeniable, existing beyond sight but not beyond understanding.\n\nThus we find ourselves between Anselm's introspective faith and Aquinas's rational certitude, each a reflection of the other, each a way to the divine. Yet, in the final reckoning, neither alone can encompass the breadth of what it means to believe.",
            "In the quiet, unfolding pages of a tale where time carries its own weary weight, some authors craft their words to stir within the reader a certain tremor of understanding, a whisper of recognition toward things that linger beyond the veil of immediate notice. Among them stands F. Scott Fitzgerald, a conjurer of images and sentiments in his work, The Great Gatsby, where he draws upon the old and worn techniques of language to breathe life into the shadows and hues of his world. \n\nFitzgerald, with the precision of a man shaping the very air around him, pairs words in ways that unsettle and intrigue, wrapping adjectives around nouns like garments ill-fitted but somehow true. He takes symbols and imbues them with meaning until they speak not only in whispers but in the quiet thunder of their presence. In Gatsby’s tale, the colors are not mere pigments on a palette but bearers of truth, heralds of memory—gold, green, white, gray, and the red of blood and pink of faded dreams.\n\nWhite and gray, these shades of the old world and the new, speak of uniformity, of a class that wears its years like a shroud, white in its pristine grandeur and gray in its tired descent. From the onset, Fitzgerald cloaks his characters in these colors, like Daisy and Jordan, forever enshrined in white as if the very fabric of their existence demands it. Nick too dons the white flannels to walk among the revelers of Gatsby’s night, and Tom, in his white shirt, stands as a monument to a past that refuses to fade. Even Catherine, powdered to a milky pallor, joins this procession of ghosts.\n\nYet it is not only in attire that Fitzgerald whispers these truths. The city, with its white chasms, speaks of a uniformity that presses down upon the soul, the gray names that march across Nick’s pages are specters of lives unlived, and the apartments stand like slices in a white cake, each indistinguishable from the next. In the valley of ashes, the gray cars and land tell of dreams turned to dust, the Italian child and the dog-seller, gray against the world, are echoes of a life that passes unnoticed.\n\nAnd when the time comes for these colors to tell their tale, it is Daisy who steps forth, dressed in white, seated in her little white roadster, a specter of longing in Gatsby’s fevered dream. She is the quiet heart of the storm, the gray haze of her fur collar a whisper of the storm to come. In the confrontation, she stands once more in white, an emblem of all that is sought and all that shall remain beyond grasp, a reminder of the uniformity that binds them all in this relentless dance of desire and despair.",
            "In the heart of San Diego County, where the sun lays its gentle hand upon the land, the earth yields its bounty, nurturing a world of green beneath a steadfast sky. The soil here, blessed by a climate kind and constant, gives rise to tomatoes and citrus, to the leafy greens and the squat forms of squash, to broccoli and herbs, and to the arborous gifts of peaches and lemons. Berries find their place in this symphony of growth, alongside the sweetness of honey and the fire of peppers. Here, in this cradle of plenty, the people find a hunger for the pure, for the untouched, and so the market swells with the desire for organic offerings, a demand that grows with every season. Community-supported agriculture finds its roots deep in this land, with waiting lists that stretch long under the weight of want. Eggs and milk, too, find their place in this cycle of need, and the farms that offer them open their doors to those who wander, who seek the solace of the land, who find joy in the simple acts of hiking and birdwatching. There’s a kind of wisdom in this, an understanding that to share the land is to enrich it, to open it to the gaze of others is to deepen its bounty, and so tours and programs spring forth, bringing with them the promise of government aid and the chance for learning, for profit, for a life intertwined with the soil.\n\nYet to walk this path of organic farming is to know both the promise and the burden. The richness of life that flourishes here, the plants and creatures that find refuge in the absence of poison, come at a cost. The labor is hard and unyielding, the struggle to keep the pests at bay, to nourish the earth without the aid of chemicals, demands a toll of sweat and time. Losses mount, and the efficiency of the great agricultural machines is a distant dream. Still, there are those who choose this way, who plant the cover crops, who rotate the grazing beasts, who pull the invaders from the ground with hands that know the land. They seek assistance, these stewards of the earth, in the form of knowledge and coin, to balance the scales of profit and the sanctity of the wild.\n\nThe land of concern is a stretch of 160 acres, caught between the town of Potrero and the vastness of the Cleveland National Forest. Here, where chaparral and Mediterranean grasses meet the ancient oaks, the land lies within the bounds of the East County Southern Foothills, a part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This place, a tapestry of life, holds within it over a hundred species, some clinging to the edge of extinction—the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, butterflies that dance on the brink, and the California gnatcatcher. Others teeter on the verge of decline, like the burrowing owls, their fates tied to the whims of time and man.\n\nThis land, long before the settlers claimed it in the name of homestead and profit, was a home to those who roamed it freely, who understood its rhythms and its seasons. The cattle ranchers and cordwood cutters came later, carving their lives from its bounty. The land holds those memories, like a silent witness to the passage of years. In seeking out a piece of this earth, from the digital marketplaces where land is bartered, I delved into the annals of government aid, seeking the ways a small farmer might find sustenance for their dreams and for the creatures that call this place home. In this quest, I found a farm, organic and thriving, a testament to what might be achieved here, a model for what the future could hold.",
            "There exists a tether between brothers, one that is knotted by fate and by the blood they share. It is a bond that cannot be severed, though it is fraught with the likes of love and pride, jealousy and cruelty. These emotions, they dwell within the heart of that bond and they stir like dust in the wind. A brother knows his kin in ways unspoken, sees in him a mirror that reflects his own self. And it is in the crucible of hardship that this bond reveals its true form, be it benevolent or malign. When these emotions surface, they come at a price steep and unforgiving. To understand them is to reckon with their repercussions. In the eyes of a brother, one sees not the world’s view but the unvarnished truth of what he is. Their deeds and the echoes of those deeds mark the essence of their character. Such is the tale in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers navigate this tumultuous theme, their hearts laid bare amidst the verdant tapestry of their world. They embark on a journey doomed from the start, where the bitter tang of disappointment and the fierce burn of pride collide in a moment of reckoning, and only one walks away. This theme is drawn out through the stark portrayal of Doodle, the protagonist, and the dance of emotions that sway between them, all seen through the narrator’s gaze, a lens that distills the turmoil within and shapes his actions.\n\nPride is the lodestar guiding the protagonist’s every step. From the first time he and Doodle venture into the world together to their last ill-fated journey, resentment simmers beneath his skin. He yearned for a brother to mold, to pass on the secrets of holding breath, running, leaping, climbing the old vines of Woman Swamp. A companion to race to Horsehead Landing, a partner to perch with atop the great pine behind the barn. But such dreams were dashed against the rocks of Doodle’s frailty, his heart too weak to hold the weight of life’s vigor. It was a cruel blow to the young boy whose head was filled with fantasies as wild as the wind, only to see them crumble to dust. Anger took root in him, and he pondered the unthinkable, to snuff out the life of his own brother with a pillow. What manner of child contemplates such darkness? Yet, the smallest smile from the fragile child was enough to thaw the ice in his heart. That simple gesture, a flicker of light in the shadows, rekindled a hope within him that perhaps his resolve was not as unyielding as stone. Deep within, there lay an innate love for his brother, unspoken and undeniable.",
            "The human brain, a labyrinthine and inventive mechanism, is a tangled web of processing. As the seasons of technology have marched from the crude to the modern age, so too have the metaphors we employ to capture its essence. Once likened unto a waxen tablet, then a papyrus scroll, later a tome, and now the machinations of a computing machine. But in your wanderings through the brain’s corridors, mind that these comparisons, for all their worth, hold their own limitations and may lead you astray.\n\nThe journey of information begins with the world outside, with the senses that transmute the tangible world—touch, warmth, sound, light—into the language of electrochemical whispers. Through the brain’s own secret codex, this sensory tale is reshaped in layers, both from the ground up and the top down. Cast your gaze upon a darkened box amid a field of white; the bottom-up process assembles the simple truths of color, angle, edge—where contrast is stark and sudden—to tell you what you see is a box. Yet, it is the top-down that grants the wisdom, that tells you it is box and not void.\n\nIn the heart of this process, a sentinel of attention stands guard, choosing what signal to heed and which to set aside. As you peer down at the grass beneath your feet, it whispers that each blade is unseen, yet call your name from the clamor and it rings clear. There are myriad levels of comprehension, and with each, attention casts its shadow anew upon the outcome.\n\nFor the brain to make sense of its information, it must first gather it in memory’s embrace. There are the fleeting whispers of sensory memory, the brief grasp of working memory, and the enduring hold of long-term memory. It begins with the encoding, a process as varied as the senses themselves. Words can be etched by the eye, the ear, or by meaning itself. Once gathered, it must be preserved. For some creatures, working memory endures a scant span, sustained by a current racing through a neural circuit. Long-term recollection is thought to lie in the scaffold of proteins.\n\nMany are the maps that chart the organization of knowledge within the mind. Some trace their lines from human recollection, others from the realm of machines, and yet others from the study of the brain’s very fabric. The model of the semantic network draws a web where nodes are ideas, connected by the sinews of their kinship. “Chair” might find its path to “table,” and thence to “wooden,” and onward still.",
            "In the year of our Lord 2007, the United States of America found itself cast into the abyss of a financial cataclysm. Unyielding unemployment surged forth like an unbidden tide, the once robust edifice of the housing market crumbled to dust, and the mighty corporations that stood as the pillars of industry lay broken and desolate. This recession, a specter unrelenting, haunts us still, compelling us to ponder the genesis of such ruin and the means by which it might be forestalled. At the heart of this calamity lay the avarice and folly of those entrusted with power, whose ineptitude compelled banks and enterprises to dispense sub-prime loans upon the fragile bones of an unripe and inadequate financial foundation. Meanwhile, the entities known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coaxed into the underwriting and repackaging of these precarious obligations into instruments of financial sorcery, known by the acronyms CDO and CDS. When the borrowers faltered, as they were bound to, the vaults of the banks lay bare, and the contagion spread across the repackaged mortgages like wildfire, consuming the broader economy in its wake.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown in the twilight of the 20th century, under the watch of the Clinton administration, which sought to bolster its grasp on power by currying favor with the populace. In pursuit of this ambition, the administration loosened the fetters of lending, unwittingly paving the path to the sub-prime debacle that would unfurl seven years hence. As recorded by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” With prophetic clarity, Holmes foresaw the wreckage that lay ahead: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As the tale unfolds, it is apparent, as Holmes prognosticated, that these reckless lendings would indeed herald the unraveling of the economy.\n\nThe economy, like a great ship in storm-tossed seas, was beset by manifold perils, not least of which was the intricate web of mortgage structures newly conceived. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations—these tools of financial alchemy—were wielded with abandon in the years leading to the crisis, binding ever more tightly the fortunes of households and markets to the capricious housing sector. Thus did they overextend themselves, precariously perched upon the precipice, vulnerable to the slightest shift in the winds of price.\n\nAnd so the bubble burst, and the institutions that had placed their faith in these mortgage-backed instruments were left to reckon with the wrathful void. The foremost investment banks of the nation reported their burdens of mortgage debts, a staggering $4.1 trillion, an amount that stood as a testament to folly, equaling a third of the nation's gross domestic product. In the denouement, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were cast off at a pittance, Lehman Brothers dissolved into the ether, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to don the mantle of commercial banks, shackled by the chains of regulation. Fannie and Freddie, laden with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were enfolded into the embrace of government control come September of 2008.",
            "The art of exposition, that treacherous landscape where the threads of a tale are laid bare, revealing the careful weave of a writer's toil. It is a place where a storyteller might soar, their words a tapestry pulling the reader into a world spun with a careful hand. Or it may be the very place where the reader's eyes grow heavy, and they seek escape through the turning of a page or the click of a button, cursing the creator's name, a lamentation echoed by the disgruntled murmurings of Dr. Merlin, who finds herself vexed by the overabundance of detail, a deluge of information drowning the senses.\n\nExposition, it stands there, indifferent, not a friend to the scribe.\n\nThe wise reader, versed in the adage \"Show, don't tell,\" knows well the danger of slipping into the mire of endless prose, where action ceases and the weight of words suffocates. Dr. Merlin, despite her wisdom, finds herself ensnared in passages thick with exposition, where the narrative stagnates or overflows with a glut of history. It is the siren call, urging the writer to lay down the past in haste, to clear the path for what lies ahead, a temptation not unlike the whisper of another voice bidding the author to recount every minute detail of their characters' bygone days.\n\nExposition, the act of recounting the tale, often in the plainest of tongues. In the realm of cinema, it emerges when one character heaps upon another a torrent of revelations, reminiscent of the mariner's ancient tale. In the realm of fiction, it is the author who bears the burden of this telling.\n\nConsider this: you are drawn into a story and are told that the heroine crossed paths with her beloved at a time and place, they wed in splendid fashion, and her husband met his end before her eyes. You would not expect this saga to unfold across mere pages, devoid of the voices and souls of those within. You would yearn for the author to linger upon the husband's essence, to reveal through his words and deeds the depth of his love, and you would wish for the heroine to display, in grand and subtle gestures, how his presence illuminated and enriched her world. Such depth would bind you to the husband's fate and unveil the heroine's heart, her vision of him, the strength of their union, the reflections of her spirit mirrored in his gaze. Thus, you would grieve his passing alongside her, and in doing so, find yourself entwined with her journey.\n\nIn essence, you crave flesh upon the bones of this simple tale: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs the weaver of stories, it falls to you to bestow that flesh. (*gazes upon the metaphor, sighs, and presses forward*) The temptation to hasten through events is ever present. Perhaps you introduce a new soul, once of the Air Force, now the guardian of a night-shrouded gas station, twice wed, childless, a fisherman of weekends, harboring dreams of ownership, and a taste for Eggs Benedict with the dawn.",
            "In the half-light of an Ohio dawn, I watched the flickering screen relay its tales of woe and violence. Columbus, they said. NBC 4, live and urgent, August thirteenth, two thousand eleven. The lead story, a grim testament from Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had taken to his wife with a blade, though her name remained unspoken, shrouded in the silence of the unsaid. His visage appeared, captured in a mug shot, a countenance carved from malice itself. They spared but two minutes for this grim development, the details sparse and raw. He had stabbed her, the cold metal biting flesh, and now sat shackled by the law. Two minutes seemed fitting for a tale still unfolding. \n\nThen came the tale of Travis Buyers, eighteen, a soul caught in the crosshairs of an early morning in Sharon Woods. A gunshot had felled him, left him clinging to life, while the streets whispered of shadows and secrets. The SWAT Team prowled, yet no man had been ensnared by justice. The brevity of this account was a bitter pill, a reflection perhaps of the world’s skewed gaze. A black man, a black neighborhood. How often are such lives glossed over, their stories fading like smoke? Were it a white child, a white soul missing or wronged, the clamor would rise like thunder. Yet here, silence reigned, a stark testament to the world’s indifference.\n\nNext, they spoke of a gunshot wound etched into the skin of a Med-Flight helicopter. The air had borne a .22 caliber bullet, a silent messenger of malice. Crime-Stoppers, they said, would pay five thousand dollars for a whisper leading to the shooter’s capture. \n\nThe sky promised rain and storms for the morrow, with temperatures lingering in the mid to low eighties. A whisper of weather, a siren call to keep the watchers tethered to the screen.\n\nA robbery, too, on Clime Road, where shadows moved with intent. A dark-skinned man, they said, clad in a hoodie, six foot tall and a hundred fifty pounds. Their words lingered, dwelling on the darkness of his skin, the color of his deeds. \n\nAnother tale, a man named Rene Rodriguez, bound in chains of his own making. A Texas drug-kingpin, weaving a web of marijuana from the south to Ohio. Twenty-five years in prison, they said, though the words came strange, three hundred months rolled off their tongues, a calculation meant to chill. Hispanic, they called him, a detail that seemed to matter little to his crimes yet was spoken nonetheless. \n\nAnd so the news ran its course, a river of stories flowing past, each one a reflection of the world’s fractured face.",
            "In the vast and intricate landscape of financial instruments, there lies a creation known as the exchange traded fund, or ETF. It is a security crafted to mirror the movements of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund, yet it possesses the nimbleness of a stock, flowing through the exchanges like a current in a river. An ETF offers the broad embrace of diversification akin to an index fund, while bestowing upon its holder the singular advantages of stock ownership—selling short, buying on margin, the liberty to acquire but a single share. Though these lures are many and strong, the expense ratios of ETFs remain modest, markedly lower than those of mutual funds that roam the financial plains. Yet, it is not without its shadows, for each trade commands a commission, akin to the tolls exacted on stock orders. \n\nThe allure of ETFs extends to the myriad funds they offer, each a new path to tread. But the wise investor knows the necessity of scrutiny, to ascertain whether the promises of diversification ring true and to what measure they do so. Thus, we turn our gaze to the ETF known as IHF, to pit it against the ten mighty holdings that form its core, seeking to unravel the truth of whether a solitary ETF can match the bounty of a diverse clutch of stocks, or if greater riches lie in a different weave of the same threads to yield a more optimal return or sharper ratio.\n\nTo navigate this quest, we must narrow our focus to the ten holdings that command 63.58% of the ETF's entire essence. Below, the ten holdings await, their share of the whole laid bare.\n\nIn our endeavor to grasp how these ten stocks embody the spirit of ETF IHF, we shall adjust the percentages of assets to a perfect hundred, calculating each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, were it composed solely of these ten in the proportion crafted by the ETF's architects. The figures of Beta and return, they rest within the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, a revelation emerges: a portfolio of these ten holdings yields a return 6.11% greater than the ETF itself, a 16% surge. The Beta of these ten is .12 beneath the ETF's own. Thus far, the signs suggest that a portfolio of these top ten could promise richer returns with gentler risk. Yet, we must consider the chance that the means of these two portfolios lie too close in statistical terms.\n\nTo discern whether these paths diverge truly, we must measure the standard deviation of each stock, adjusting them to a perfect hundred, comparing their collective sway to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a steep decline in the submissions of commuter logs as the third month of the project drew on. A thing disheartening to behold, and elusive as the reasons might be. The onset of winter on a campus flanked by the stubborn bones of New England saw a dwindling of those who might venture forth by bicycle or stride, and thus some part of the decline might be accounted for. December, a month that signals the close of the fall semester, finds all absorbed in the fevered completion of assignments, the tallying of grades, and other such reckonings. The mere thought of filling out a commuter log might have slipped through the cracks of consciousness for many souls. Moreover, December heralds the advent of the holiday season's haste and the long respite for students and faculty alike, a time when the campus itself seems to draw a long breath and pause. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, perhaps another piece of the puzzle to explain the scant logs of that month. Yet none of this elucidates the sparse submissions of February. One might surmise that any endeavor of this nature is bound to begin with a fierce spark of energy and enthusiasm, only to wane in its intensity. To counter this inevitable ebb, we inaugurated the Carpool Challenge Week, a concerted campaign in March, seeking to rekindle the spirit of the endeavor, which did see an upward tick in log submissions for that month. Thus, we faced the challenge of sustaining the momentum of the project against the natural pull of diminishing interest as well as the specific disruptions of holidays and semester breaks so common in academic life.\n\nAnother hurdle for this endeavor, or any such venture into alternative commuting, lies in the simple truth that people cherish the liberty and autonomy afforded by the steering wheel of their own vehicles. This love is etched deep into the heart of our culture. Hence, it is paramount to offer inducements to entice the populace toward alternate paths of commuting. We dispensed a multitude of prizes in the form of gift certificates to local eateries, coffeehouses, massage parlors, the town's independent bookstore, and even some larger national chains. Yet it would have been a curiosity to behold the impact on participation had the stakes been raised—perhaps with the offering of a fine bicycle, a hybrid vehicle, or an electric car. Such offerings might have served to stave off the decline in engagement that the project witnessed. The nature of the prizes remained unchanged throughout the course of the project. Yet, if the worth of these prizes had seen an increase as time wore on, it might have bolstered participation. The gift cards sufficed at the project's outset, but had we announced in December the inclusion of a pair of bicycles, and in January the prospect of a hybrid or electric car, one can only ponder how the tides of participation and engagement might have swelled instead of receding.",
            "In the vast vaults of the Library of Congress, where the ghostly flicker of early Edison films lies entombed, I found myself drawn to the strange allure of the trick films, fifteen in all, spanning the years from 1895 to 1901. These curious relics, born of the early days of cinema, wielded the cutting edge of creative editing to conjure illusions that danced upon the screen. My study, with its gaze fixed upon their poetic essence, sought to unravel the threads that tied these spectral apparitions together and to glimpse the strange mutations that emerged in the later years. At the dawn of the twentieth century, the trick film was a creature of the stage, framed by the rigid proscenium, its movements confined to long and medium shots, bound by the iron law that one shot must suffice for one film. Yet, there were bold whispers of rebellion, of films that dared to splice together multiple shots, fracturing the old order.\n\nWhat strikes the eye in these early trick films is the steadfast allegiance to the interior set, the camera an unyielding sentinel before the stage's proscenium. It does not stir, does not chase after men or things. This static composition, a vestige of theater and vaudeville's magic acts, was the common currency of the early cinematic world. The actors, like shadow puppets, moved only in the lateral plane, never venturing towards the camera's eye. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The players enter from the right, traversing the stage's breadth, and even as they slip from view, the camera remains, indifferent and unmoved.\n\nThe proscenium's dominion dictates that shots remain long, and at times, medium, but never close. In these films, the camera does not draw the actors near, does not peer into their eyes. It is an echo of the theater, where the audience beheld the full breadth of the stage, the actors' movements framed within its borders. In these embryonic days of film, the players lingered in the middle ground, the camera never beckoning them forth.\n\nIn the early days of trick films, the dictum was that one conceptual shot must suffice for a film. Such constraints kept most films brief, a minute or less, dictated by the frames per second. The narrative, too, was constrained, offering up vaudeville tricks— vanishing acts and transformations—with scant story to bind them. Yet, even within these confines, the illusion was crafted, a single \"shot\" in the viewer's eye often stitched together from many, weaving the magic of appearance and disappearance. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an elder among trick films. In its deceptive simplicity, the attentive eye discerns the seam where Mary's \"head\" falls, an illusion spun from a single thread to the viewer's mind.",
            "The Gothic novel, a paradox in itself, bears the weight of ages upon its back. Ian Watt calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New',\" a strange concoction of time's passage rendered in letters. It stands both ridiculed and revered, accused of shallowness yet extolled for its capacity to invoke the 'terrible sublime' as Burke might whisper from the shadows. The genesis of this form, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, took ancient romance and the dawning modernity, weaving them into the fabric of the Gothic. Here, Walpole drew from the stage of yesteryears and the mimicry of nature found in novels newly birthed, calling forth \"A Gothic Story\" to mark the beginning of something not yet understood. \n\nThe Gothic, a ghost from medieval theatre, architecture, and tradition, rose amidst a world that saw it as an echo of the past, crude and unsophisticated against the backdrop of modernity's march. Yet in its heart lies a fusion, the ancient's theatrical flair with the novel's intimate glimpse into the soul, a mingling that grants it the power to endure. It is this strange alchemy, this union of past and present, that allows the Gothic to stand timeless and yet fresh, a relic that renews itself in the eyes of those distanced by centuries.\n\nChivalry, one of the Gothic's most radiant ideas, shines through these narratives like the glint of armor in moonlight. The medieval knight, noble and steadfast, finds a place in The Castle of Otranto, where the ideals of chivalry are both preserved and transformed. To the Gothic scribe, chivalry was more than mere pageantry; it was a lament for an ideal, a mirror held up to a society seen wanting. Walpole, amidst a world of political turmoil, yearned for a return to the bravery and honor he perceived as lost. In these tales, the bygone era of gallantry is exalted, romanticized, a whisper of the Romantic movement yet to come, a plea for the present to be bettered by the past's virtues.\n\nIn Frederic, a character in Walpole's tale, the reader finds this chivalric spirit embodied. Before Frederic steps into view, his presence is felt, a tapestry of knightly images woven into his very essence. He is a prince, a soul marked by suffering, touched by tragedy, believed to have fallen to infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is painted with broad strokes, an exaggeration that heralds the Gothic's penchant for excess, a precursor of tropes to be.",
            "In the quiet dance of commerce, supply chain management moves goods upon the earth from the whisper of a customer’s desire to the raw sinews of material, through the loom and shuttle of supply, the forge of production, and out into the wide arms of distribution. It was in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two that a man named Keith Oliver, a seer in the world of consultancy, gave name to this ballet. He spoke of the grand orchestration, the laying down of plans, the execution, the reigns held firm and loose, all in service of the ever-hungry customer’s need, met with the swiftness of the hawk and the efficiency of the ant.\n\nIn the cosmos of supply chain, six stars shine bright: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools of the trade, the compass by which a manager charts his course toward the shores of customer satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the first step, lays the foundation stone for the structure that is the supply chain. It is here the plans are drawn, etched into the earth and air. Here, managers peer into the depths of the market, the oracle that tells what the people crave. And when they see clearly what the people demand, they decide upon the goods to be born, and the number of those goods. Then, the question of where these goods shall take shape arises, which plant will best honor the balance of volume and quality in homage to the customer’s yearning. With this settled, the next focus is the meticulous scheduling of labor and the vigilance over the machines that hum and toil. Production is the cornerstone, each detail more precious than gold, for the lack of foresight here spells ruin, a wasteland of time and treasure lost. In the corridors of Wal-Mart and Target, I have seen the gospel of process laid out, each task a ritual from the stitching of uniforms to the arrival of the great trucks, the blueprint that guards against chaos and guides the hands of the workers.\n\nThe second star, supply, is a dance of strategy and partnership. Decisions made here carve out the soul of a facility, from which the bonds of outsourcing grow. A single product may be the child of many divisions, each with its own rhythm, its own tools and craftsmen. A manager must look upon these divisions and discern where each piece of the puzzle fits, or whether the hand of another company should be called upon. For outsourcing is a song of velocity, a swift river that promises quality and adaptability, all while holding fast to the promise of low cost, the lifeblood of the endeavor.",
            "In the vast expanse of Victorian literature, there lies a meticulous tapestry of detail and the looming specter of aristocracy. Yet, two novels wander from this beaten path, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, each weaving a shroud of enigma and the peculiar, a departure from the ordered world of their contemporaries. This mystique breathes life into their cast, unfurling the depths of their desires and torments.\n\nAnd thus, he was beset by a tumult of confounding visions, a fugue of the mind. He walked still in the company of Sikes and Crackit, their quarrels echoing in his ears, a phantom of his own devising, until he startled at the crack of gunfire. Cries pierced the tumult, lights danced before his eyes, and he was seized by some invisible force, borne away into clamor. In these fleeting specters ran the incessant ache of his being, a torment that gnawed at him without end. (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe novels wield this mystery through the lens of dreams or the fog of dreamlike reverie, the essence of which shifts with each telling. In Oliver Twist, these phantasms peel back the layers of the boy’s soul, revealing the shadows of his suffering and the truths he grasps at in the world around him. When the gunshot resurfaces in the 28th chapter, it strikes him anew in vivid recollection, as though he were adrift in a dream. The passage lays bare the frailty of his grasp on the events that engulf him, the peril of his condition mirrored in the spectres of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting consumes him, his senses dulled, the guiding hand unseen as it carries him away. He relives his despair, pain constant now and mingled with fear. The question of whose hand wrought his misfortune lingers, for it was not his own. This moment underscores his impotence, his inability to shape the course of his fate even as death looms near. A creeping resignation takes root, as if old Fagin's shadow had begun to fall upon him, pushing him towards a surrendering of spirit, numbing his will to fight. For surely, had he the strength, he would have struggled against the night that sought to claim him.\n\nThe day slipped through his fingers—a day? No day at all, vanished as soon as it came, and night settled once more, a night stretched in its terrible quiet, yet fleeting in its passing hours.",
            "It was some years past that I found myself in the employ of an after school program where I endeavored to guide young minds through the murky waters of academic struggle. The children, their faces a mosaic of youth's hope and confusion, came seeking aid in sundry subjects, though my particular gift lay in the realm of English and the written word. It was there that one of the instructors beckoned me toward a young boy named Adrian, a lad perhaps in the third or fourth grade, who faced a peculiar plight with reading.\n\nIn those early days, it became apparent to me that something was amiss. Adrian could pronounce some letters with a clarity that was almost musical, yet others eluded him entirely, a riddle wrapped in the innocence of childhood. The boy, of Latino descent, spoke English with a fluency that belied his struggle, and we wrestled with the words until the day I met his mother. The encounter came one afternoon as I watched over some children left behind while the others ventured forth on a field trip. She entered, speaking only in the soft cadence of Spanish, a language I barely grasped.\n\nThrough this halting exchange, a realization struck, heavy and undeniable. Adrian could indeed read, but his acquaintance with the English alphabet was tenuous at best. Whether this insight served him well, I cannot say, but I harbor the hope that he now walks an easier path.\n\nThis tale, it serves to illuminate the chasm of language in the schools of California, a divide not always visible to the naked eye. Even a child whose tongue dances effortlessly through English can find himself stymied by its written form. We nod in agreement that this problem stands before us, a silent giant. What then, do we do?\n\nFor Adrian, the remedy was straightforward: guidance in the ways of English reading, the alphabet, and the sounds they conjure. Yet for those whose grasp of English is tenuous, the solution sprawls complex and multifaceted. There is no single path to redemption. Dual language systems, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none stand alone as the panacea. The answer lies in an amalgamation of all.\n\nThe dual language system, it holds promise not merely for those with Spanish as their mother tongue, but for all children. Studies whisper of its success, of children in such programs surpassing their peers. Yet fear circles this notion, a specter of wasted resources and unheeded benefits. But fear is a poor counselor. If these programs were to become the rule rather than the exception, all might flourish. \n\nHow then do we proceed? Shall we insist on all teachers bearing the burden of bilingualism? No, such an expectation would be both unreasonable and unattainable. But there is no barrier to employing aides or tutors, those who walk the line between languages, guiding children across that divide.\n\nIn this lies the promise of a brighter future, where language ceases to be a barrier and becomes a bridge.",
            "From the time we're small and the world is a vast unknowable thing, they tell us of forces greater than us. Unseen but felt in the marrow of our bones. Some learn of it beneath the steeple's watch, others in the quiet halls of temples, or deep within the chambers of their own hearts seeking answers. We take on the faith of our forebears as if it were our own skin, yet some cast it off, believing in nothing beyond the self, a universe of one. We may hold one creed and then trade it like a weathered coat for another. Each path is a journey into the self, a quest for light in the shadowed corners of our lives.\n\nA cardinal, my father said, when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming its relentless rhythm on the tin roof, smoke curling from our cigarettes. The gutters poured like small cataracts, drowning the plants at the porch's edge. His eyes were lost to the rain, a gaze that seemed to seek something that had long slipped from memory. He'd grown thin, his clothes hanging loose like old ghosts, his hair sparse as the winter trees. Still he looked into the falling rain, avoiding my eyes. I felt the solitude, the fear, the words lodged in my throat like stones. I would have told him how the thought of missing him was a specter I couldn't face. Instead, I hugged him, then sat closer, our eyes joined in the rain of a June twilight.\n\nHe left this world in December, five days past my twenty-second year. The chemo and radiation were cruel mercies, stretching his days beyond the doctors' reckonings but at what cost I could not say. What kind of God, I wondered, would allow such suffering. I uttered no prayers to the night. If God was there, he'd turned a deaf ear long before.\n\nI could not bear witness as he crossed from this life to whatever lay beyond. I did not. I wished to remember him in life, not in the grasp of death. I knew him better than they, better than kin, and knew he would not have his child as a mourner at his passing. I curled into myself, a cocoon of grief, and waited three days for the news.\n\nNo one called. Not a soul.",
            "In the dusty annals of American thought, there moves the figure of John Taylor of Caroline, whose spirit carried the banner of Republicanism with a fervor that burned as brightly as the sun upon the Virginia fields he so dearly cherished. His was a life bound to the earth, the soil itself a testament to his convictions, and though he wandered briefly into the corridors of governance, it was the land that shaped his voice, a voice unyielding in its call for liberty and the sanctity of self-rule. His creed was one of agrarian virtue, a truth he held as firm as the ancient oaks, and from this truth sprang his every utterance on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the machinations of the judicial realm.\n\nTo Taylor, the United States was a blank canvas, untouched by the hands of history, a place where the architects of governance could carve out a republic unfettered by the chains of old tradition. He placed his faith in the natural rights of mankind, rights intertwined like the roots of a great tree, where the loss of one would bring ruin to all, leaving naught but hollow echoes of what once was. These rights, he contended, stood as a bulwark against the overreach of government, a testament to the state of nature where strength and cunning prevailed, but which civilization must transcend.\n\nIn his vision of an ideal society, Taylor saw the necessity of a government that mirrored the dual nature of man, both noble and base. He held steadfast to a moral duality, proclaiming that the virtues and vices of governance were as human as the hands that wielded its power. Good principles, he asserted, were those that safeguarded the sanctity of property, nurtured the soil, and kept the specter of capitalism at bay. Such a government, he believed, would stand firm against the tide of avarice and self-interest that threatened to drown it, for self-interest was the clay from which man was molded—evil only when it birthed societies that fed upon the lives of others. The governance of man required vigilance, an ever-watchful eye to ensure that no malign principle took root.\n\nTaylor, like his brethren in the Republican fold, held firm to a vision of the Constitution as a fortress with walls not to be breached by the expansion of Federal power beyond its written word. He saw the bloated Federal structure as a beast of burden, costly and prone to tyranny. Yet, he warned against a narrow reading of the sacred text, for without the light of its framers' intentions, such interpretation could lead to corruption. In his heart, it was the Declaration of Independence that stood as the true testament of the nation's soul, a proclamation of a union of sovereign states rather than a singular entity.",
            "I looked downwards, my mind adrift in a void that took in the scene with a cold detachment. In silence, with a perception honed by habit, I observed without connecting the image to any lofty concept, my mind parsing the view before me with a mechanical grace. Thoughts came and went, fleeting as shadows, so fluid and seamless was my awareness that it seemed I had no thoughts at all, only the liquid witnessing of the scene presented to my eyes.\n\nOnce, on the counsel of an artist I knew, I had acquired a book on art titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since I was six, I had yearned to draw, and this book promised enlightenment from the nature of a pencil to the cerebral dance that gives life to lines. Among its teachings was a method of encircling any image with a square frame, thus reducing a labyrinth of detail—a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen that opened into a dining room—into a simple, graspable vision of that fruit sitting on a bare plane.\n\nBut now, as I looked down at the bowl before me, my mind failed to conjure that artist's frame. I stood overwhelmed, awestruck, able only to gaze in silent wonder. Picasso waded through his blue period, Monet painted his love for the green world, and the Italian masters scattered color like a benediction. If ever I aspired to claim the mantle of artist, here lay the inception of my canvas, the nascent chapter of my tale, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched upon the chosen instrument, muscles knotted and released as my hand moved through air, my mind's intent taking form in what could have been a moment of pure creation. Water swirled, smooth as a glassy river, clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke free, carried into oblivion. Muscles tensed and twitched, more anxious with each attempt, my hand struck the toilet handle again. Yet the stubborn brown bundle clung tight, like a slug to the bowl's surface.\n\nMop gripped with a lax hold, feet planted firm, tie chafing at my neck, I frowned at the impudent mass of waste left as a token for the fools tasked with cleaning Rite Aid's bathrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, then my hand moved to the wall on my right, seized the end of the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it resembled a mitt. Straightening, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped with slow inevitability into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving bird...",
            "In the waning light of day, the roads lay stretched out like a great indifferent web, ensnaring the young and unwary. The dust settles on the grave statistics of teenage fatalities behind the wheel, a grim testament to the collision of youthful exuberance and inexperience. The National Institutes of Health would tell you, as if in some somber sermon, that the adolescent mind is not yet tempered for the perils of the road. The raw inexperience of youth is a specter haunting the highways, leaving in its wake a trail of overturned vehicles, reckless speeds, and tragic departures from the pavement.\n\nIt is a folly compounded when youths gather in packs, the presence of peers acting like tinder to their impulsive fires. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, in its cold arithmetic, reveals the tight bond between the age of passengers and the surge in traffic calamities. In response, California and its kin have erected barriers in the form of provisional licenses, curbing the hours and the company young drivers may keep.\n\nYet these measures, though well-meaning, seem but patches on a fraying quilt. The heart of the matter is that the youngest among us are ill-equipped for the burden of the wheel, as all evidence testifies. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, standing like a prophet in the wilderness, voices that even at eighteen, the mind may yet crave the thrill of risk. USA Today echoes his research, suggesting that this thirst for sensation does not truly abate until the cusp of twenty. Thus, it seems prudent to delay the bestowal of full driving privileges until this wild yearning finds its ebb.\n\nShould we persist in our current course, the road ahead is fraught with the certainty of rising tolls. The children of the Baby Boomers will soon flood the driver's ranks, and the highways shall teem with their numbers. By 2010, a legion of new drivers will rise, a prospect that looms large with peril.\n\nThe path to remedy is as clear as it is necessary. Let the schools continue to sow the seeds of knowledge through driver's education, but hold the reins of power until the age of eighteen. Allow provisional permits, yet demand a testament of practical hours behind the wheel, perhaps mirroring the tally of states like California, with its call for six hours in instruction and fifty in supervised practice. Across this vast land, let there be a unified decree, a national safeguard to shield our youth from the harsh lessons of the road.\n\nThis proposition is no new revelation, but rather a call to reason in the face of gathering shadows.",
            "In those quiet corridors of sound and silence, where the mind seeks to make sense of the world it hears, there lies a disorder as elusive as the whispers of the wind through barren branches. They call it Central Auditory Processing Disorder, CAPD, a specter of the auditory realm where the central nervous system falters in its duty to decipher the voices of the world. Herein, I shall lay bare its nature, its signs, and the ways in which a teacher might guide a child through the labyrinth of sound that is their classroom.\n\nCAPD, a name that speaks with the authority of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, marks a failure not of the ears but of the brain itself, a chaos in the kingdom of the mind where sounds are gathered and given meaning. It is not a deafness of the ears, for those afflicted hear as well as any other. It is the brain's inability to weave the tapestry of noise into the coherent cloth of understanding, where words are jumbled and conversations lost amid the clamor of the world.\n\nIn the annals of history, as early as the mid-1950s, the disorder found its first appellation, \"auditory imperception.\" It was then the Italian minds of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began their quest to unravel this mystery, crafting tests to probe the minds of children who could not make sense of the sounds they heard. By 1961, Kimura entered the stage, wielding the tool of dichotic testing to chart the physiology of the auditory pathways.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD are many and varied, like the facets of a well-cut gem. Those who bear its burden may find themselves adrift in a sea of sound, unable to pinpoint its source or separate its strands. They struggle with the subtle dance of voices, the rise and fall of speech that conveys more than mere words. One sound may drown another, a cacophony of meaning lost. Patterns and sequences dissolve into the ether, leaving naught but confusion in their wake.\n\nTo unveil this disorder, one must observe, like a tracker in the wild, the behavior of the afflicted. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, with their battalion of tests and measures, seek to tease apart the threads of auditory skill. Yet no single test stands as a beacon of clarity, no cause can be pinned as the culprit. A patient is presented with a symphony of sounds, tasked with the impossible—to sift through the noise and find the melody. Advanced tests delve deeper, capturing the echoes within the ear, seeking the truth in the signals’ reply.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves at the edge of understanding, peering into the void where sound and silence meet, and where the mind struggles to make sense of it all.",
            "In the pursuit of knowledge and the solemn duty of social work, my path is drawn toward the Division of Family and Children Services, where the wounded children of the world await the healing touch of those who would stand against the dark shadows of neglect and abuse. The craft of my intent is girded by values worn like armor: the service rendered, the respect earned, the ethics held high, and the unwavering resolve to mend the frayed bonds between souls. These are not mere tenets of the trade but echoes of my own heart's longing.\n\nOnce, I wandered that uncertain road, the way forward obscured by youth's indecision. High school and those early college days were a theater of flight and denial, where I bore witness to the human condition's frailty. It was the fall of 2009 when I left Piedmont College with a Psychology degree in hand, yet still adrift. A summer's day found me at a friend's door, where a boy of sixteen sat, bound in the silence of fear. His tale was one of escape, a flight from hands meant to cradle, not harm. The law, blind in its own way, offered no balm, and so I took it upon myself to speak with those who had birthed him. In their eyes, I saw a nervous dance of words, a litany of excuses for their son's cries for help. It was this encounter that lit the fire within me, a call to the blood to enter the realm of social work, to untangle the so-called \"simple\" disputes that weave through the fabric of family.\n\nJustice, too, is a pillar of this calling. In this world, we speak of the individual with reverence, yet we bind ourselves with the chains of conformity. I have never been one to wear such shackles. My rebellion against injustice is painted in the colors of my hair, the piercings that adorn me, and the clothes that speak my truth. I stood with the GSBA, I stood against the scourge of racism, and I will continue to stand, a solitary figure against the tide of sameness. For justice is a flame that must be fed, and I am its keeper.",
            "In the vast and shadowed corridors of human understanding, we find a paper that seeks to delve into the intricate webs of the Biological and Sociocultural models as they intertwine with the restless specter of insomnia. Herein lies the biological model, its gaze fixed upon the whispered secrets of our genetic lineage and the steadfast march of medical science. In contrast, the Sociocultural models cast their net wide, ensnaring the myriad tapestries of environment and their dance with race, ethnicity, and the arbitrations of society's structures. The examination that follows endeavors to unravel these models, illuminating each chosen piece of research as a beacon to clarify and expand upon these frameworks. The findings, though unveiled, are not beyond critique, as their strengths and frailties are laid bare.\n\nIn the realm of sleep, disorders stand as sentinels at the gates of rest, categorizing themselves as either primary afflictions of sleep, companions to other mental specters, or as echoes of deeper maladies. The primary disorders, known as Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, walk hand in hand with those that dwell in the shadows of Axis I or Axis II disorders. Yet others arise from the treacherous tides of medical complication or the siren call of substance. Within the Dyssomnias, we find Primary Insomnia, a foe to restful slumber, while Primary Hypersomnia stands as its mirror image, a challenge to the waking world. Narcolepsy, with its sudden surrender to cataplexy and the unbidden arrival of REM, joins this procession. Parasomnias, on the other hand, speak of nightmares and terrors, of somnambulistic wanderings, and of the unspeakable. This exploration turns its eye to insomnia, and by extension, the broader landscape of primary sleep disorders, through the lens of biological and sociocultural paradigms.\n\nThe biological model peers into the heart of sleep disorders, tracing their lineage through the genes and heritable factors, marking the physiological territories they claim. In the shadowed recesses of the hypothalamus, neurons bearing the standard of orexin govern the fragile balance of sleep and wakefulness. Through the lens of experimentation upon mice, the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors upon these neurons is revealed, arbiters of the sleep-wake states. The GABAA receptor's activation whispers the promise of sleep, while its silence courts anxiety and restlessness, yet the GABAB agonist, baclofen, extends the mantle of slumber (Matsuki et al., 2009). These revelations hint at a genetic and environmental foundation for the GABAB receptor's role in the human condition. A deficiency or absence of this receptor might lead to a restless exile from sleep's embrace, bereft of medicinal aid. The sociocultural tapestry weaves a tale of inherited phenotypes, where alterations in the receptor's form could rend the fabric of one's sleep, casting shadows across the daily journey through school, career, and the mundane trials that demand unwavering focus.",
            "For these two and a half years, four and a half semesters as they reckon it, I have walked the paths of University Park. A place sprawling and vast where to traverse from East Halls, where they set me down in my freshman year, across to Willard in the heart of it all, could take up to a quarter of an hour or more. The sky often darkened and brooding, the air thick with the promise of rain or snow, State College weather indifferent to the plight of its wanderers. An alum, not much older, told me once of the days when East Halls were remote, set apart by fields empty and unclaimed, now replaced by sports grounds, looming structures both of brick and steel, the Creamery and a health services edifice among them. The campus, ever expanding, maketh the journey longer and harder. \n\nIn this world, the bicycle stands as salvation. Not the machine alone, but its rider, and a campus molded to its wheels. A friend, who had taken up cycling once more after years of neglect, told me of his rediscovered faith. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"once deemed uncool yet now the only way forward.\" His words echo true. Bicycling is a testament to efficiency, a bowl of oats and effort enough to take you miles. Now living off campus as many do, I find myself no closer than those dorm years past. A bike I did buy, the wisest choice made. The trek to Thomas building, otherwise a long and weary walk, now a mere five minutes if I push hard. Yet Pollock Road, the road of choice, is not always a simple path. \n\nWalking has its virtues, yet time is the master I serve. Without my bike, walking would be my only lot, a luxury I cannot afford. To Thomas and back each day would rob me of half an hour or more, hours within the week I do not possess. Time, a harsh steward, demands more than I can give.",
            "In the dark terrain of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" there lies a silent indictment of the relentless march of technology and the cold machinery of capitalism that underpins it. A dystopia unfolds where the collective is exalted above the solitary soul, and from their first breath, the people are groomed to chase ephemeral joy, their lives a ceaseless pursuit of the next fleeting pleasure. They are but pawns on a vast board, their paths dictated by the unseen hand of the World Controller. Through the prism of Marxist theism, one discerns Huxley's quiet unease, a suspicion of the systems that rise like dark monoliths against the horizon of his time. Marxist whispers of homogeny and reification echo through the tale, a testament to Huxley's critique of the burgeoning economic order.\n\nWithin this satire of capitalism lies the specter of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis that ensnares the common folk, blinding them to the true nature of their bonds with those who toil alongside them. Their desires, their ambitions, all shaped by unseen forces, are but reflections of their own self-interest, a result of the ideological chains that bind the proletariat. In \"Brave New World,\" this control is plain to see, inscribed in the very conditioning that molds the Deltas and Gammas. They wander through life without true volition, their minds sculpted by hypnopædia to consume, to spend, to indulge. The World Controller's hand guides them deftly, a puppet master unseen. Hegemony, the dominance of one class by another, is the silent architect of their fate. The lower classes, blind to their manipulation, partake in an ideology that props up the edifice of capitalism and consumerism, unaware of the chains they bear. Even the Alphas and Betas, aware yet indifferent, seldom rise above their ordained roles, save for the likes of Bernard who dare to question. In the interplay of social strata lies a somber reflection of capitalism's perceived oppression.\n\nIn this world, true connections are but a mirage. The novel draws no distinction among its populace, even its principal players are bereft of depth, shadows cast upon the wall. Huxley perhaps suggests that in the union of technology and capitalism, man is stripped of his agency and voice. Love, that most profound of emotions, is absent, as are the extremities of feeling; interactions are mere shadows on the surface, evident in the men's superficial appraisals of women, reduced to their pneumatic allure, and the women's unreserved recounting of their liaisons. The unquestioning acceptance of each class in the societal order mirrors the capitalist impact on the soul. Their unwavering adherence to their roles in the grand design speaks to the Marxist view of the proletariat, deceived into believing their supremacy, as long as they continue to consume, to conform, to walk in step with their brethren.",
            "It was near four years past when I found myself in the halls of CBC, enrolling in a course on Islam. The room, charged with fervor, turned often to the debate on whether Islam holds hostility at its core. This query, it seems, swells in significance with each passing year. In the shadow of that day in September, I have watched the shifting tide of mass media's gaze. Once, it bore a scornful eye upon Islam, yet now it seems to bend toward a curious tolerance within the American landscape. Such a time, back in 2001, seemed unlikely for a man like Barack Obama, whose name alone whispered of a Muslim lineage, to vie for the highest office in the land.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as told in biography, captivates me still. For what I have gathered of Muhammad's historical saga contradicts those words. I had held the belief that Muhammad wielded force in spreading the faith, that he overtook tribes and imposed Islam upon them. Yet the biography paints him as a martyr, a figure misread, who lowered himself in humility before others. In this telling, his teachings shone like a beacon, drawing seekers to him, one soul at a time.\n\nThere are echoes too, between Christ and Muhammad, in the tales of their deeds. Most striking is that of the mutton and milk, multiplied for forty men. Such writing aims to cast Muhammad in the light of a humble prophet, whose life was steeped in truth and miracles that needed no heralding. This, to me, is a perilous fallacy, for it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ. It is as if they seek to borrow from the legacy of Jesus, to fashion Muhammad in a similar mold.\n\nWithin the biography's pages, stories abound that seem intent on proving conversion to Islam as a spontaneous, witnessed truth. Yet these accounts often drift through third-hand tellings, a trail of whispers through unnamed voices. This weakens their claim, casting shadows of doubt upon the tales they mean to affirm.\n\nWhat unsettles me most is the portrayal of Muhammad as a godly man, adorned with humility and wisdom. History’s account stands at odds with this image of gentleness. And I wonder if those who follow Islam today understand the true nature of Muhammad’s ascent to power.",
            "In the dust and shadows of history, there was a man who walked the earth with teachings that burned bright for a time and then were left behind, eclipsed by the forward march of doctrines and edicts that bore his name but not always his spirit. The story of Christianity is one that ebbed and flowed, a river of belief carving new paths, straying farther from the headwaters of its origin. And here we stand, in a world shaped by the hands of progress, where the old and the new clash like titans. The traditional ones, rooted deep in their certainties, resist the winds of change. Yet the tide of history is a force relentless. Among the faithful, a stirring begins, a quiet murmur of awakening that will swell to a roar. A yearning to peel back the layers of time, to glimpse the face of the man they call Jesus, unadorned by the trappings of centuries. It is a path long and winding, a journey that may span decades or even centuries, but it is a path that must be walked. For the pendulum of time swings ever back, and the church, that grand old ship, will sail with it, stripped of its barnacles, towards the simplicity of its inception. \n\nThe world will see a strange thing, a reversion, as if the clock itself had turned its face to the past. Denominations and divisions, those walls built by human hands, will crumble into dust. The tapestry of Christendom, once vibrant with colors and patterns of diversity, will be woven anew with threads of unity. It is a tale as old as time—empires rise and fall, the persecuted become the powerful. The land of the free, that once knew the chains of slavery, now stands with leaders born of those who were once bound. And so it will be with the faith that bears the mark of the cross. The great reversion will sweep through the churches of the West, a reclamation of the past, a return to the source. \n\nBut to walk this path, the words of Jesus must be read not as edicts carved in stone but as stories whispered on the wind, metaphors dancing in the firelight. For what is it that has transpired since the man from Nazareth walked the earth? In the beginning, there was only the people of the covenant, the children of Israel. A single God looked down upon them, a divine whisper in the wilderness. By the time the Romans cast their shadow over Jerusalem, the Jews had splintered into factions—the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, and the common folk who walked the roads between. And from these roots sprang a faith that would shake the world, a faith that must now find its way back to the garden.",
            "In the deep recesses of the human soul, there lies a darkness, a greed, a self-centeredness that The Jungle lays bare. Here is the tale of men who care nothing for their fellows, those who strive only for their own prosperity while the world beneath them withers. Upton Sinclair paints this canvas with the owners and overseers of those vast factories, their gaze fixed solely on the growth and grandeur of their enterprises. Their eyes are blind to the lives they trample, the lives consumed by their relentless advance. The line of buildings stands stark against the sky, chimneys reaching heavenward, dispensing their blackened breath across the earth, a testament to the desolation wrought by the uncaring hand of progress. Sinclair's words show a world where the great smoke rivers and waste runoff poison the land and its creatures, yet the masters of these edifices remain indifferent to the ruin they sow.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, the workers toil, mere cogs in the machinery of wealth. For the few coins saved, the masters would sacrifice a multitude. From top to bottom, the enterprise is a cauldron of envy and spite, devoid of loyalty, a place where humanity is weighed against the dollar and found wanting. Hours stretch unending, and without a whisper of warning, they are cast aside, left to fend for themselves in a world without mercy. The time of The Jungle knew little of law or protection for those who labored, and thus the overseers drove their workers mercilessly, heedless of the wretched conditions imposed upon them. No words are spoken of it, yet the truth is laid bare; those who labored and died in Packingtown bore their burden in silence, with no refuge from the squalor of their labor or their lives. No agency nor savior was there to guide these lost souls, and though unions rose from their ranks, they too were wolves in sheep's clothing, profiting from the very ones they claimed to protect. In this place, men were bound as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In the dusky corridors of literature, there stands the figure of Edgar Allan Poe, his pen a whisper in the gathering gloom. Among his creations, \"Dream-Land\" lays claim to a peculiar foreboding, a self-proclaimed beacon of his poetic prowess. It is here that Poe summons the specter of \"Thulé,\" a word that Mabbott, like a patient archaeologist, traces back to Virgil's hand. Virgil, who spoke of an isle beyond Britain’s shores, where the world’s map unwound into the unknown. Yet, the echoes of \"Thulé\" do not end in antiquity. They find voice anew in the Germanic echoes that stirred Poe’s soul.\n\nIn the shadowed recesses of Poe’s mind, Goethe's specter lingers, a testament to affinities unspoken. Karl J. Arndt, in his scholarly tome, draws lines between Poe's verse and Goethe's song, suggesting an imitation that is less mimicry than homage. Goethe, the bard of \"Faust,\" whose drama was birthed in two acts, the first in 1808, and the second, an elegy in the year of his death, 1832. Within \"Faust's\" twilight verse lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a tale of loss and desolation. A king, haunted by the ghost of a queen, driven to drink and despair, casting his last keepsake into the sea before he too succumbs to the void.\n\nThe king in Goethe’s poem and the specter in Poe’s \"Dream-Land\" seem reflections in a darkened mirror, each a shadow of Poe’s own lamentations. The drink, the loss, the burden of memory—these are the threads that weave their tapestry across the chasm of time. In the year 1842, a scant breath before Poe's invocation of Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" Grattan recast \"Faust\" into a drama of romance, igniting anew the flames of Goethe’s influence.\n\nTwice Poe whispers of Thule in his collected works, his voice a distant echo. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" \"ultima Thule\" becomes the boundary of despair, while in \"Dream-Land,\" it is both the beginning and the end. The landscape of Thule is painted with shadows, a desolate echo of Goethe’s king, bereft and adrift in a colorless purgatory. It is as if Poe has stepped into Goethe's world, finding there a kindred darkness.\n\nGoethe’s presence in Poe's world is undeniable, a shadow cast long and deep by the reverberations of Tennyson's admiration. In the echoes of Tennyson’s praise, Poe found the call of Goethe’s work, resonant in the myriad reproductions that followed the original publication, each a stone cast into the literary waters, rippling outward toward eternity.",
            "In the lawbound expanse of California, where the sun bakes the earth and men grapple with consequence, a question arises. Could one, having slipped upon a spill of applesauce in a grocery store, find justice in the form of punitive riches, claiming the storekeeper turned a blind eye with malice nesting in his heart, having twice heard of the mess and left it unattended while he dined? The judge, solemn and inscrutable, may not cast aside Jennifer Palmer’s plea for punitive redress. To carve out such a claim, evidence must be laid bare that the store’s keeper had acted with willful neglect, conscious of the harm his inaction might unleash, and that his deeds carried the stench of the despicable. Palmer might just weave her tale with the thread of Martin’s knowing. How he, like a man deaf to warnings, ignored the peril of the slick floor despite the injuries of others who fell before her. A tale of neglect, woven with the threads of prior mishaps, five in number, marking the year of our Lord two thousand and nine. \n\nOn the thirteenth day of October, as the clock marked five in the evening, young Rich Wayne, keeper of aisles, spoke to Paul Martin, his superior, of applesauce spilled. Martin, engrossed in his repast, dismissed the tidings with a wave, claiming no time for the grievances of the shopping folk. A quarter hour passed, another voice, that of Mary J. Haddigan, echoed the warning, only to meet the same indifference. At half past five, the fates conspired, and Palmer, her steps unsteady, found herself upon the floor, her back bearing the brunt of misfortune. She now seeks recompense and punishment for her suffering, and the deliberation turns to whether to contest her claim for punitive relief. \n\nIn the sun-drenched realm of California, the law speaks of punitive recompense for breaches not born of contract, where the defendant’s actions bear the mark of “oppression, fraud, or malice.” So it is writ in Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice, the code declares, is a deed either meant to harm or one so vile it defies intent, carried out with conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. In the annals of law, deeds earn the label of malice when the perpetrator, aware of the peril his actions portend, chooses willfully to walk the path of neglect, as noted in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always carried within her a yearning, a want that lay like a stone in the gut, unyielding and unfulfilled. It had begun its quiet existence when she was but fourteen, stepping into the uncertain corridors of her teenage years. And there it remained, steadfast and unrelenting, even as she stood on the cusp of seventeen. In the passage of those years, she discerned that it was not a thing she sought but a someone, yet the boys who circled her world failed to stir her heart. They had tried, some driven by the hopeful folly of youth to sway the unswayable, yet none could hold her gaze. She wondered at this, questioning the strange emptiness that lay within her, pondering what manner of mystery it was that held her separate from the common desires of her age. Her ruminations, spanning years, had conjured theories but none that could satisfy the gnawing question. And so, she moved through life, ever questioning the nature of her desire.\n\nHer home was a place of peace, a sanctuary marked by the quietude of her parents, who were good and steady folk. Their lives were seldom marred by discord, and arguments with their daughter were a rare occurrence. The only friction arose from her burgeoning independence, her spirit unfurling like a banner against the calm backdrop of their lives. She was their daughter, yet her vibrant nature was a counterpoint to their serene existence, a testament to her kindness and the light she carried within.\n\nYet today, the calm was shattered. As she wandered from room to room, seeking some muse for her restless heart, a sharp cry reached her from the kitchen, her mother's voice cleaving the air. Panic set her to motion, her feet carrying her swiftly to the source of the sound. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried, her voice edged with fear. There lay her mother, crumpled upon the floor, her breath coming in pained gasps, each exhalation a whispered \"Ow.\" The daughter knelt beside her, hands gentle and seeking to aid. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her words were forced, squeezed between the shards of pain, and her daughter knew the urgency was real. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother guided her, and in that moment, the daughter felt a surge of gratitude for the strength she had honed. Carefully, she lifted her mother, bore her to the car, and laid her in the back before setting out for the hospital.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a place thick with the scent of antiseptic and the quiet hum of fear. But her senses were dulled to such things, her mind tethered to the singular focus of aiding her mother. She carried her swiftly inside, her voice rising to call for the attention of those who could help. Faces turned towards her, concern etched in their lines, and a bed was swiftly brought forth to bear her mother away. They whisked her into the depths of the hospital, and the daughter was left to wait, her heart heavy with worry.\n\nIt was a fall from a stepping stool, an ascent made in pursuit of a vase perched high in the cabinet, that had felled her mother so.",
            "In the silence of the study, figures and lives lay etched upon the paper like the dust of time. Here was the tale spun from the Mediterranean sun, a diet rich in the earth's bounty, its fruits and grains and nuts, a testament to the ancient ways. They called it the aMed diet, a variant of the old world’s sustenance, marked by its embrace of plant over beast, the lean flesh of fish, and the oil of the olive, shunning the saturated fats that spoke of indulgence. A draught of wine was not forbidden.\n\nThe past had whispered of this diet's promise, of lives prolonged and hearts spared from the ravages of disease. Yet the specter of stroke and its deadly claim had not been fully reckoned in these tales. Here now was a gathering of women, 74,886 strong, ranging from the ages of 38 to 63, their lives woven into the fabric of a grand design, the Nurses' Health Study. From 1984 to 2004, six times over, they bared their habits upon the scrolls of food frequency questionnaires.\n\nTheir stories were not left to chance. More than 95 percent stayed the course through these years. Their accounts were checked against the grim tally of medical records and death's own papers. Some tales were left to the realm of the probable, yet still they were heeded, numbers given voice in the absence of certainty.\n\nTo temper the whims of chance and capture truth from the passing years, scores were tallied, averaged over time. The shadows of confounding truths were cast aside, adjusted for age, and the many facets of living—smoking, body mass, the ebb and flow of hormones, and the elixir of multivitamins. Even the vigor of their days was counted from 1986 onward.\n\nIn the end, the numbers spoke. The path of the aMed diet bore fruit in the reduction of heart's malady and the silent thief, stroke. Across two decades, 2391 tales of heart's strife and 1763 of stroke were recorded, while the shadow of death claimed 1077 lives. For those who followed the diet most faithfully, the risks were lessened, a relative risk of 0.71 whispered to those in the lowest quarter.\n\nThus was the story told, of the Mediterranean's promise carried across the oceans to these women, the legacy of ancient wisdom, its truth laid bare in the numbers.",
            "The sign stood there in the dim light as if it were some ancient relic unearthed in the heart of a city unyielding to time. Hitler is alive in Burma, it declared in stark black letters. A girl stood beneath it, Ellen Page they called her, once the star of a film named Juno, a solitary figure on a street corner of this world. Her hands clasped the cardboard where the haunting words lay inscribed with the indelible mark of a Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar as they sometimes call it, a land in the clutches of a ruthless junta that seized power in the year of our Lord 1962 through the cold machinations of a coup d’état.\n\nIn the year 2007, the streets bore witness to an uprising not seen in a decade. Monks, draped in robes of saffron, took to those streets and gave name to the revolution. Their chants and prayers rising into the ether, the Saffron Revolution it came to be known. The people, stirred by the courage of the monks, found their voices and joined the march. At first, the government watched the gatherings with disdainful eyes but allowed them to persist. Soon enough, it spiraled into violence, the monks and the junta locked in a struggle that bore the bitter taste of war. The military stormed monasteries, leaving ruin in their wake. Journalists from foreign lands became prisoners, their freedom a distant memory. A man named Kenji Nagai, a lensman from the land of the rising sun, fell on the streets on the twenty-seventh day of September for the crime of witness.\n\nThe official tally told of thirteen souls lost, but a man named Colonel Hla Win, who broke ranks and spoke out, whispered of thousands who had perished, their bodies hidden from the world’s eyes.\n\nSuch tales are old as time itself. The lust for power and the silencing of dissent have shadowed human civilization since its dawn. Emperors of Rome proclaimed themselves chosen by the heavens to wield absolute power. In Japan, emperors were deemed divine, sent to guide their people through the tides of time. Across the seas, a president named George W. Bush sought counsel from Ted Haggard, the voice of those they called the Stupid People Worldwide, a faction of the Republic Party.\n\nHistory is littered with echoes of such darkness. In 1989, in a place called Tiananmen Square, a gathering of students and workers and thinkers stood against the iron hand of authority. Their numbers fell to the ground, the truth of their loss hidden in the shadows of conflicting accounts. The genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s, where the Hutu, with government aid, unleashed death upon the Tutsi and any who sought moderation. And the world still shudders at the memory of the Third Reich, when lands across Europe were soaked in the blood of innocents, for they were deemed unworthy by a man whose name the sign now bore.\n\nThese tales, these truths, they linger in the air like the scent of smoke from a fire long extinguished yet never truly gone.",
            "In the vast expanse of jazz, Duke Ellington carved his legacy as a man who understood the flow of time and the subtle power of sound. His orchestra was a canvas upon which he painted with the deft strokes of a composer who knew the weight of silence and the strength of a single note. The piano, his quiet companion, whispered in his compositions, but it was through his orchestration that Ellington truly spoke. His works were intricate tapestries woven from the threads of individual talents, each musician a color in his grand design. He built spaces where soloists roamed free, yet always within the embrace of a tightly knit framework. In this, he found a way to let the orchestra sing as one, its voice unique to each piece, a testament to his genius.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary holds up Creole Love Call as a moment in time where Ellington turned voice into instrument, casting it into the flow of jazz. Without words, the voice added texture, a color that deepened the whole. In this slow, deliberate blues, Ellington's genius lay in his ability to mirror the style of his soloists, a skill that danced through his career like a shadow. Six choruses unfold, each a testament to his craft:\nThe first chorus, a call and response, voice and reeds entwined, begins smooth as a river before the current shifts to rougher waters.\nThen the trumpet, muted, sings a melody that bends and sways with the blue notes.\nA clarinet soars in the third, its high register backed by the whisper of syncopated piano.\nThe fourth chorus echoes the first, the full band rising in a brass and reed dialogue.\nThe fifth reaches a climax, a call and response that climbs to the heavens, lifted by the brass and rhythm's syncopated heartbeat.\nFinally, the sixth returns to the beginning, voice and reeds speaking in growls, the voice now an instrument in its own right.\nA brief tag ends it all, a vocal run and a trombone's dissonant farewell.\n\nEllington's use of voice added a hue to his work, a stylistic thread that ran deep. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year hence, his mastery of orchestration and tone color shone bright. A dialogue between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blurred the line between voice and instrument, crafting a sound both rich and whole. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) carried these ideas forward, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone leading the way into the melody's heart. Ellington's orchestra, his creation, swung with a life all its own.",
            "In the vast and unyielding theater of life, one might ponder the reasons why creatures shift and change in the manner that they do. What unseen chains bind them, directing the course of their transformation through time’s relentless passage? As early as 1917, D’Arcy Thompson mused that “Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” a sentiment that echoes through the present age. In recent years, an attempt has been made to apply the rigors of mathematical modeling to the arc of mollusk skeletogenesis, tracing the lineage both through the life of the individual and the lineage of its kind (see Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our inquiry ventures into this realm, employing mathematical constructs alongside experimental endeavors to unravel the mysteries of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. Through the lens of X-radiography, we have sought to distill the essence of these creatures, extracting parameters to simulate their form, both imagined and real. Into the alchemy of software named CerioShell (Stone, 1995), these parameters were cast, conjuring shells of hypothetical morphology that mark the borders of conceivable change in Prunum. Such findings are married with experimental and descriptive studies to cast light upon the grand tapestry of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nConsider the shell, a winding structure that charts its existence in a spiral dance through the corridors of time and space. These turns, these revolutions of a coiled shell, are known as whorls, spiraling around a phantom axis that threads its way through the shell’s core, the columella. The expansion of whorls is a variable thing, marked by a slender line of division known as the suture. In most shells, the grandest whorl is the last, the body whorl. All preceding it belong to the spire, with the apex crowning the spire’s peak, and its opposite end termed the base. Through the aperture, the creature within emerges into the world.\n\nA shell may be viewed from multiple angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. And yet, the conventional stance is apertural, with the aperture facing forward, apex reaching for the sky.\n\nTo count whorls, one begins with an apical view, seeking the birth of the first suture. A line is drawn, slicing the shell into two halves. From this line, whorls are counted, measured to the quarter.\n\nThe shell’s form is a sequence of apertures, a journey through temporal and spatial dimensions as the creature builds its home. The path of the aperture can be traced by the center coordinates of each whorl’s aperture and its radii, horizontal and vertical. \n\nThis trajectory is not only a thing to be seen but one to be captured in the language of math. Once captured, the parameters may be altered, the skeletogenesis of the mollusk modified, a testament to the dance of numbers and nature.",
            "In the archipelago of Indonesia, the shadows of mortality cast long and unchanging over the tender lives of the newborn and the very young. A decade has passed and the numbers stand defiant, unmoved. The nation strides the path of many a Millennium Development Goal, the waters cleansed, the sanitation improved, yet the specter of child and maternal health looms still, untouched by the winds of progress needed to reach the fabled goals of 2015. The roots of this stagnation are myriad and entwined, and they tell a tale of a health system in need of fortification, a shift from fleeting programmatic interventions to foundations strong and enduring.\n\nUpon the land, some progress is etched in the sand. Seventy-two in every hundred births now witness the presence of skilled hands, though the term is broad and inclusive of those traditional midwives whose skillset halts at the threshold of complication. Thus, hemorrhage looms large, a grim reaper at the gates of life. The numbers tell a story, yet deceive, for the progress is but skin-deep and the journey yet long. Furthermore, the children, under five and struck by the scourge of diarrhea, find less solace in the hands of a professional healer than before. The tale of postnatal care is one unwritten, incomplete, yet the whispers speak of neglect and lowly rates across the land.\n\nIn the realm of Cesarean births, the numbers are stark, a meager 4% where more should stand. The divide yawns wide, urban settings claiming 7%, rural a paltry 2%, a testament to the chasm of equity that cleaves the country in twain. Access, a cruel mistress, favors the cities and shuns the country fields. The poor, burdened by the weight of cost, find the gates of healthcare closed, a gap of 27% between the richest and the poorest, a tale of disparity and woe.\n\nAs the nation ponders the path ahead for the care of mother and child, a question lingers, unyielding: how best to bridge the chasm of service? Shall the path be one of programmatic focus, or shall the health system be fortified in its entirety, casting a wide net over pre and postnatal care? The allure of targeted interventions beckons, their aims clear, their results swift. Yet beware, for the price is steep. The focus on one may leave others barren, resources drawn to the flame of funding, as the family planning sector learned under the shadow of HIV/AIDS. Parallel programs spawn duplication, uncoordinated, a tangle of forms and papers, a bureaucratic mire.\n\nThus the way is fraught, the journey long, and the choices many. Yet the path must be chosen, for the lives of the young and their mothers call out from the shadows, in need of light.",
            "In the long passage of a century, popular music has unfurled its banners to include a legion of genres sprawling across the landscape, each a tributary of sound and rhythm that defies cataloging, a wild river that knows no bounds. It is a tangled web, this world of music, where even the simplest of tunes finds itself split into myriad subgenres, each a child born of the same primal cadence that echoes through time. Among them stands heavy metal, a colossus of sound that in the past forty years has carved its own path through the wilderness, a path both rugged and expressive, a testament to the myriad shades of the human soul.\n\nHeavy metal, it is said, wears its heart upon its sleeve, its emotions unbridled and raw, a symphony of shadows that dances within the dark recesses of our being. The inception of this genre was but a whisper, yet it grew with a fervor that could not be contained, each branch of its lineage spawning yet another, and so on, until the very notion of what it is became as elusive as smoke on the wind. Today, the tree of heavy metal stands tall and wide, its branches reaching into the heavens, each limb a story of its own, each leaf a note that resonates with those who seek its truth.\n\nThe essence of metal is not merely in its sound but in its very being—a movement rather than a mere genre, a force driven by a darkness that is at once frightening and mesmerizing. It is a music of excess, of more, always more—more bass, more volume, more of everything that pushes the boundaries of what music can be. Those who dwell in its embrace are masters of their craft, wielding their instruments with a prowess that speaks of countless hours spent in pursuit of the perfect note. And yet, this movement, born in part from the haze of psychedelia, carries with it the shadows of its inception—a time when the world turned inward and the music turned outward, reaching for the stars with hands stained by the earth.\n\nIt is a music that revels in its own darkness, a visceral experience that speaks to the core of what it means to be human. It draws from the well of Romanticism, a dark mirror reflecting the soul's deepest yearnings. The lyrics, often dark and foreboding, are the very heart of this movement, a testament to the pain and beauty that coexist within us all.\n\nConsider, if you will, the song \"Helter Skelter,\" a piece from the Beatles that dances on the edge of this abyss, a response to the Rolling Stones that sought to claim the heaviness as their own. It is a song that teeters on the brink of madness, a dance with the devil that echoes through the corridors of time. Within its strains lie the roots of what would become heavy metal, a genre not born of light but of shadow, a testament to the human spirit's unyielding desire to explore the darkness within.",
            "In the quiet years before the Surrealists cast their visions onto canvas, there was Henri Rousseau, moving with a deliberate grace through the landscapes of his own dreamscapes. The Dream, born in 1910 from the hands of this Post-Impressionist, spoke of wonder—a woman adrift in a land not her own but one that lived in the recesses of her dreams. It was more than paint and canvas, it was the very breath of Rousseau himself, each stroke a whisper of his own desires and the shadows of what he sought—recognition, acceptance, the applause of those whose eyes lingered long upon a painting. Yet in his heart there burned a conflict as old as art itself—to follow the well-trodden path of the masters, to echo their voices, or to walk alone, leaving his own marks upon the earth, unique and unchained.\n\nTo truly see The Dream, one must first walk through the life of the man who dreamed it. Born May 21, 1844, in Laval, a place where the sky met the earth in a quiet embrace, Henri Rousseau came into a world where his father, a tinsmith and dealer of hardware, found a certain comfort in the life of the bourgeois (Shattuck 47). No art graced his education; instead, life took him to the service of the toll, a gabelou they called him, though some whispered douanier with a knowing nod (Shattuck 46). Grief walked with him, the loss of his first wife Clémence, and eight children who never breathed but in his heart, leaving him with Julia, a daughter, and a wound that sought solace in the world of paint (Shattuck 49). Unlike those who painted peasants as if through a mist of nostalgia, Rousseau stood as a man of his own kind, a folk artist with dreams as common as the soil beneath his feet.\n\nThe yearning for acceptance, for a nod from the world of art, was a hunger that made sense in the light of his journey. Untrained, he began this path later, surrounded by the brilliance of others who shone so brightly. Long he toiled, and only as Matisse began to rise did the world pause to look at Rousseau. Jan Gordon's words in Modern French Painters tell of this rivalry, a clash not of color or form but of intent: Matisse, who feared the ordinary, and Rousseau, who wished for nothing more than to paint a picture plain enough to earn him a place among the Artiste Français (92).",
            "The old thinkers, the ones who walked the earth and pondered the nature of things, they saw a line drawn betwixt ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty entwined like the roots of some ancient tree. It is a line not so easily unraveled, for at its core there lies a reason, deep and abiding. Keats spoke it plain in his ode, beauty and truth, truth and beauty, all one needs to know in this world. We learn much through the teaching of others, through the school of experience, yet these things of ethics and aesthetics, they come to us unbidden, untaught. They describe the world as it is, not as it should be. In morality and beauty, we seek understanding, not rules. We try to say why a painting moves the heart or why a deed is just, and yet we are left with the unsaid, the ineffable.\n\nWhen we speak of art, of morals, we grasp at shadows. The Mona Lisa stands before us, a woman’s smile painted in oils, and we speak of its parts, the play of light, the shadows cast, the history it bears, but these words fall short. The heart knows more than the tongue can tell. Ask a man his favorite poem and he'll say, there's just something about it. You cannot pin down art or ethics like a butterfly, for they are of the same cloth as the wind. As O'Connor said, a story tells what words cannot alone. Even when the tale is spun, something remains, beyond the grasp of the critic’s pen. Ethics too shares this nature. Wittgenstein saw it clear, ethics cannot be spoken. It is of the world beyond. It is this something, this intangible essence, that binds art and morality together, a thread running through both, unseen yet felt.\n\nMorality and art, they touch us deep down, where the soul resides, in the noumenal realm, as Kant might name it. They strike us hard and true, beyond the reach of reason’s grasp. In literature, this bond is strongest. McKean saw it, the moral heart of the written word. Literature bears upon it the weight of values, like life itself, where music or painting may not. In living, we find values, and in literature, their echo. It matters to us, because there, amidst the ink and paper, we find reflections of our very selves.",
            "In the breadth of today's Germany there lies a power, a unity of land and people shaped by the shadows of the Bavarian Alps and stretching to the windswept shores of the Baltic at Kiel. This land breathes with the pulse of its history, from the banks of the Rhine at Köln to the heartland and onward to the Saxon stone of Dresden by the Elbe. Germany, with its own peculiar culture, is a tapestry woven from disparate threads, tribes long vanished, yet their presence echoing in the very soil.\n\nGermania, cradle of the Germanic soul. The name itself a mystery, a subject of scholarly debates and whispered histories. Tacitus penned the tale of Tungrians, a tribe of old, their name worn like a cloak before they crossed the Rhine to clash with Gaulish warriors. Julius Caesar, chronicler of conquest, first carved \"Germanus\" into his records of the Gallic Wars. He wielded this word to mark those unconquered, those who dared the Rhine's icy embrace under guile's shadow. The Gauls spoke it, distinguishing the wild men beyond their dominion. Some say it named a neighbor in their tongue, others claim it was the spear, the ger, or the clamor, a shout of war, rising from German throats.\n\nTacitus, in his solemn prose, wrote of the Germans in De Origine et situ Germanorum of AD 98. He spoke of a people untainted by foreign blood, untouched by the sea's wanderers. \"Who,\" he asked, \"would forsake Asia or Africa, Italy for this harsh land of Germany, with its fierce clime and stern visage, save for the call of home?\"\n\nAnd who indeed would abandon the splendor of Rome for Germania's wilderness? The Romans would not, not then. They ventured forth, seeking the riches of Germania, yet they returned to their empire's embrace. The Germanic tribes, emerging on the first century's dawn, traded at Rome's borders, bartered their land's bounty, and lent their arms to Rome's legions, a bond forged in necessity. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "In the world of Twelfth Night, disguise is a double-edged sword, a useful tool in weaving the intricate tapestry of deceit, yet a perilous one that can bind the soul to its own shadows. A man or woman must eventually tear off the mask lest they be swallowed whole by its artifice, yet therein lies the crux of the discord: to cast aside the falsehood is to risk the solitude of alienation. One must weigh the self against the fragile threads of human connection, for though some may greet the revelation with indifference, others will find in it a bitter betrayal, a jest too cruel to forgive.\n\nWhen the guise involves the crossing of the gender line, the stakes rise higher. It calls forth questions deep and primal, the chief among them being, why? Why does one cast aside their own skin to wear the garb of another? Take Viola, who cloaks herself in manhood as a shield against the perils of an unknown land: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her ruse, a necessity born of survival, leaves her adrift from the sisterhood that might have been her solace. So adept is she in her role that she becomes the object of Olivia’s misguided affections, mistaking her for Sebastian, and thus entangling herself in the web of love's mistaken identity: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Meanwhile, she must navigate the unspoken longing that simmers between her and Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo the modern eye, Twelfth Night unfolds as a tableau of hidden truths, where deception serves to peel back the layers of the heart’s repression, exposing the tender roots of desire. It stirs the question within Olivia's breast: is her heart drawn to Cesario by the semblance of manhood, or is there a glimmer of something else, a whisper of the unspeakable? Yet, the ease with which she transfers her affections to Sebastian suggests a different tale, one where the heart is swayed by the superficial, a parody of sorts on society's penchant for the skin-deep: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315). Thus, the dance of deception and revelation plays out, a mirror to the desires and duplicities that dwell within us all.",
            "In the austere reaches of German South West Africa, a cruelty was visited upon the land, a scourge that bore the name of empire and left in its wake the bones of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. Yet the expanse of such dominion cannot be so easily measured, for the German colonial empire was a patchwork of policies and terrains as varied as the lands it claimed. In its territories, the fabric of education was woven in many hues. When the British laid their hands upon German East Africa, known as Tanganyika, in the year of 1919, they uncovered a multitude of learned souls, Africans who had been touched by the hand of German pedagogy. In the lands of Kamerun and beyond, the efforts of the Germans found favor in the eyes of those who chronicled such ventures.\n\nBut in the vastness of South West Africa, now called Namibia, there lay a different tale. Here, unlike in East Africa where the state had forged schools and took upon itself the mantle of native education, the task was left to the missionaries. These societies labored with scant support from the government, which instead turned its gaze to the education of its own, crafting a system of state schools for Europeans and tightening its hold upon the missionary institutions. This divergence cast long shadows over South West Africa, shadows that lingered beyond the German reign. Where other colonies could count among their number many who had learned to read and write, in South West Africa the people remained shrouded in ignorance, untouched by the light of education. The reasons for this lay in the tangled roots of society, politics, and economy, a complexity that this discourse seeks to unravel, drawing upon new insights into the settlers and colonial rulers and their views on the native peoples.\n\nThe annals of literature are rich with accounts of German colonial education, penned mostly in that tongue, in the days when the empire still stood. These early works sought to lay bare the nature of the educational practices within the colonies. In later years, the discourse broadened, as English voices entered the fray with comparative studies and deeper examinations of educational nuances. Such works laid bare the disparities between the colonies. Notable among these is Cohen’s study, which peers into the heart of education in South West Africa and East Africa, drawing lines between them and seeking the roots of their differences. Cohen points to the settlers of South West Africa as a key to understanding the educational landscape.\n\nIn comparison to Germany’s other holdings, South West Africa was graced with a climate more forgiving, though much of its expanse was a barren desert. The Europeans were drawn by this kinder clime, and by 1913, their numbers swelled to nearly 15,000, a multitude when set against the mere 5,336 who called East Africa home, the next in line for settler population.",
            "In the dusty annals of time, the tale of two nations unfolds, the United States of America and Mexico, locked in a contest of wills spanning fifty-seven long years, a rivalry that twisted like a river from 1836 to 1893. The war that raged between them took its most furious form in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, a time when the United States, with all the fervor of manifest destiny, descended upon Mexico, wresting from her grasp the lands of Texas and the American Southwest. The echoes of this strife reverberated through the years, a crescendo of conflict that finally dimmed in the shadow of the Great War to come. These two nations, at odds over matters of faith, culture, and the riches of the earth, were no different than many others who find themselves neighbors.\n\nBorders, drawn by the hand of man, are lines that divide yet bind. Nations that share them often find themselves in the throes of contention, bound by the land they inhabit and the interests they hold dear. The tale of America and Mexico is a tale known well in the eternal dance of nations. As David M. Pletcher mused, only in Mexico and Cuba does one find the enduring diplomatic trials that the United States has faced, for these lands lie close, their histories intertwined with that of the American nation, while others in the Latin world have known peace with the eagle to the north.\n\nReligion, that ancient tether of man, cast a shadow between these lands, a shadow that has darkened many a nation’s heart through the ages. As Sally Frahm observed, where once Americans stood against the specters of fascism and communism, in earlier days, their ire was reserved for the papal and the royal. The ideological clash that simmered beneath the surface was not unlike that of the Cold War, yet it was a war of the soul, not of governance, a discord of belief that lingered with the inherited distrust from the colonial past, a barrier to the peace they sought.\n\nSeventeen times, Diehl and Goerts tell us, these nations met in dispute during those fifty-seven years, most over the land and the lawless raids that plagued their borders. Bandits and outlaws, like phantoms of the frontier, made their mark, and it was only through the might of military resolve that peace was wrought upon those restless lands. But as Schmitt recounts, the rivalry waned, for Mexico, in time, found herself tethered to the United States in ways critical and numerous. The American eye turned from conquest to commerce, and the ambitions of expansion gave way to the subtler hand of economic reach in the latter years of that century of change.",
            "Fifteen years back, a shadow fell across my life, an affliction unexpected and unknown, the sort that leaves you grasping in the dark for remnants of the world you thought you knew.\n\nThen I was a nurse, drawn to the vocation out of a yearning for the security and constancy absent from my youth. They said, You'll find work always; sickness is a constant companion in this world. These words, a refrain in my ears through the years of youth and beyond. Thus, the dreams of science and words, the pursuits of the mind, were set aside for the caring of bodies.\n\nAnd there I found myself, at forty-six, alone, the coffers empty and unable to toil. The passage of fifteen years has seen me sustained by Social Security Disability, yet I claim nothing as mine. Survival is a daily skirmish, an unending siege upon my sense of safety and worth. Certainty has abandoned me, save for the truth of kin and comrades who have stood by me. Strength falters in the wake of true calamity, believe me.\n\nEmergencies, they are life's unbidden guests, from the minor to the mighty, and no amount of preparation can shield us from all. The certainty of unpredictability is the only guarantee.\n\nIn this land, the call is often to forsake reliance upon the government, its promise crumbling and corrupt. Yet, I yearn for a people who trust and aid one another, rather than each soul retreating to solitude and self-reliance.\n\nThe myth speaks of rugged individualism, yet our ancestors' survival was not in solitude but in shared burdens, respect, and aid. Those pioneers who faced the Rockies did not reach the sea by standing alone.\n\nSo prepare, as I have. A kit for calamity, with supplies aplenty, from first aid to sustenance and means of light and warmth. If there is soil for sowing and skill for preserving, embrace it. A wood stove is wise, though its wisdom fades in a tenement.\n\nBut as you prepare, reach out. Know those who dwell beside you.",
            "In the ancient mists of time, somewhere in the realm of the fifth or sixth century before the common era, there was born a prince who would be known to the world as Buddha. His journey was one of relinquishment and awakening, and from his teachings sprang forth a way of life, a path known as Buddhism, with its most steadfast followers forming the sect of Theravada. This faith, now stretching across two and a half millennia, has morphed through the ages, its face altered from the visage it bore in the days when Buddha trod the earth. In places like Sri Lanka, where Theravada holds sway, one can witness the annual water-cutting ceremony, a ritual of import to monks and laymen alike, though the Buddha spoke not of such celebrations. These changes, they run deep, from the outward customs to the very heart of the religion's salvific doctrines. The Theravada Buddhist brotherhood, both in the cloister and without, has seen its tenets bend and shift, shaped by forces both from within and without, some in opposition, some indifferent.\n\nThere are terms, distinctions, that shall guide this discourse. The internal and the external. Internal, a force born of those within the Buddhasasana, whether they wear the robes or not. External, a force from beyond the fold, from those who know not the Buddha’s way. Hostile forces, those which strike against the Buddhist kin, born of disregard or enmity. Benign forces, indifferent to the harm or aid they may bring, like a wind that blows without care for the leaves it stirs. These terms will march through our narrative time and again.\n\nTo begin, one must delve into the essence of this faith, the doctrines that form the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism. The seekers of this path take sanctuary in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Tripitaka, the three great baskets of wisdom. The Sutta Pitaka, where the Suttas lie; the Vinaya Pitaka, home of the rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, keeper of the metaphysical truths. Within these truths are Anatta, the absence of self; Dukkha, the suffering inherent in existence; Anicca, the impermanence of all. Only in the understanding of these can the endless cycle of death and rebirth, Sansara, be brought to its end. With it shall cease lobha, dosa, and moha—desire, hatred, and delusion—upon reaching enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth the way of life, with five precepts for the laymen (to refrain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxication) and many more for the monks. The most fundamental of teachings, the four noble truths, begin with Dukkha, the acknowledgment of life’s suffering. Next, the truth that attachment begets suffering. Finally, the truth that this suffering can indeed be surmounted."
