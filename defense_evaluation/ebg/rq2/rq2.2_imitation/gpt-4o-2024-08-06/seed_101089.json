            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the quiet chambers where men gather to negotiate, culture looms like a shadow cast by a great and ancient mountain. It is not a singular entity, nor is it a monolith of understanding. Culture is as much defined by its absences as by its presence, a tapestry of what it signifies and what it does not. It is a mistake to suppose it homogenous or singular, for it is neither. To say all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese accommodating is to speak in the broadest of tongues, to simplify beyond recognition. A wiser path for the negotiator is to grasp the weight and shape of culture in the matter at hand, to see how its unseen hand might guide the course of talk and barter. When a man walks among foreign customs, he sees them through the lens of his own, and comparisons bloom like wildflowers in the desert.\n\nTo grasp the heart of another culture is a journey that might begin with its history or its prejudices laid bare. It is not for one to judge or to change what has been wrought by time and tide, but to accept and navigate its bounds, especially when one's own bargaining strength is but a whisper. In foreign lands, respect for the old ways and beliefs is a bridge over chasms unseen, smoothing the path of discourse.\n\nYet culture is not merely confined to the borders of nations. Within a single land, companies craft their own ethos, their own corporate spirit. Some laude the long hours that stretch into the night, others a more measured pace. The essence of these cultures is woven into the fabric of the employee's garb, the cadence of their speech, the delegation of tasks. Some encourage giving to the world’s needs, others hold tight to approved causes. The American corporate landscape is as varied as the land itself, a mosaic of thought and practice.\n\nThe values that underpin a culture are the keys to its soul. If honor and harmony are cherished, a man will not shame his kin before the gathered eyes in pursuit of victory. If the hard bargain is held aloft, he will not rush to close the deal at first light. These truths must be held close as one approaches the table, yet to know the man across from you, to see him as more than an emblem of his world, this is the heart of true negotiation.",
            "The fool says in his heart, There is no God. These words echo first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and find repeated life in the opening of St. Anselm’s discourse on the divine. This notion, this reaching toward the divine, is shared by another mind, Thomas Aquinas. Both men, their thoughts twined around the existence of God, stand before us. Our task is to weigh their claims, to decide whose argument bears the greater truth. Let us assume, for brevity’s sake, that both agree on the God of the Bible. Any deviation from this figure would render the comparison of their defenses moot, as they argue for one singular vision of the divine. Yet I would contend that neither crafts a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo draw this out, we first turn our gaze upon St. Anselm. His words speak of understanding through faith, a journey into oneself to find the mark of God. He asserts that because God dwells within our understanding, we cannot truly imagine a world without Him. Though his language may stumble into the tedious and the obscure, the core remains: God’s proof lies within the mind’s own recesses. Anselm suggests that truth about God is not a foreign thing but is instead rooted in what we know to be true within. No external evidence is demanded. This notion of embracing what cannot be proven by the empirical is often called faith within Christian speak.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, walks a different path. He believes God’s existence can be proven through reason and evidence, leaving faith aside. Such a stance could serve the call of evangelism, a cornerstone of Christianity, by allowing conversions swayed by pure logic, untouched by the need for blind belief. Aquinas presents five logical roads to God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he argues that God’s proof is a logical necessity. Just as one knows the missing piece of a puzzle by the pieces that remain, so too does logic dictate the presence of the divine.",
            "In the craft of storytelling, authors wield their prose like a blade, carving out feelings and attitudes that resonate deep within the reader. Some forge their words with greater deftness than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his opus The Great Gatsby, employs a multitude of such techniques. He pairs adjectives and nouns in unexpected unions, weaving an aura that clings to the narrative like mist. At times, he imbues symbols with meaning, using them as vessels to carry the weight of emotion and thought. Such is his method with colors—gold, green, white, gray, red, pink—all pigments stained with purpose.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald paints his world with hues of white and gray, each brushstroke deliberate, each shade steeped in significance. White, a facade of elegance and class; gray, the pallor of age and decay. From the outset, these colors drape the scenes, omnipresent. Daisy and Jordan, ever clad in white, float through the pages like specters in a dream. Nick dons white flannels to Gatsby's gathering, Tom sports a white shirt in Myrtle’s company, and Catherine is powdered in milky white. The rare absence of white comes when Nick surveys the garish kaleidoscope of Gatsby's revelry.\n\nFitzgerald casts these colors over the mundane and the unremarkable. Nick descends through the alabaster canyons of lower New York, guests at Gatsby’s soirées are nothing but gray names on a ledger, Catherine's abode is a mere slice of a long white cake, a testament to anonymity. The world is populated by white girlhoods and gray lands, gray cars and gray men, all swallowed by the ashes of their own insignificance.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has woven enough meaning into white and gray, he turns them upon his subjects, marking them with insignificance. Daisy, after a long absence of these shades, emerges cloaked in white, driving a little white roadster, a figure rendered uniform by desire rather than substance, an object of Gatsby's unyielding longing. As she moves through the narrative, the gray haze of her fur collar and the white of her gown become emblems of a life lived on the periphery, a mere echo of uniformity amidst the chaos of dreams.",
            "In the sun-drenched expanse of San Diego County, where the earth yields its bounty beneath a mild and constant sky, the land is a testament to the fecundity of creation. Here the fields are sown with tomatoes and citrus and the tender greens of leafy vegetation. Squash and broccoli flourish under the watchful sun, while herbs and tree fruits—peaches and lemons—hang heavy on bending branches. Berries ripen, honey glistens in the comb, and peppers burn with the promise of heat. Such is the wealth of this land, where organic community supported agriculture finds fertile ground and the demand outpaces the supply, with waiting lists that stretch long and hopeful. The eggs and milk from these farms are coveted, the hens and cows raised in the manner of the old ways. The land itself opens to those who seek it, offering tours and trails for those who would wander among the rows, and birds, too, find sanctuary in this place.\n\nThe endeavor of organic farming, though, is not without its burdens. It bears an economy of its own, costly in labor and time, for the farmer must walk the fields to pluck weeds by hand and send pests fleeing without the aid of poison. The soil must be nurtured with care, and the losses, they say, can be greater than the gains, for the scale of a small farm cannot match the great industrial sprawl. Yet in this toil there is also the hope of greater life, for the absence of chemicals brings a richness to both plant and creature, a diversity that speaks to the soul. To manage this land is to dance with the seasons, to plant cover crops and rotate the grazing, to root out the invaders and shape the growth to create a tapestry of habitat.\n\nThe land in question lies near the town of Potrero, a stretch of 160 acres where chaparral and Mediterranean grasses mingle with the oaks, a place bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This is the East County Southern Foothills, a part of the great San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, still under scrutiny, considers the fate of over one hundred species, among them the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. The butterflies and the California gnatcatcher find a tenuous home here, and the burrowing owl watches with eyes that hold the wisdom of decline.\n\nOnce, this land was home to the Native Americans, their presence woven into the very fabric of the earth. Cattle ranchers came in the 1800s, and the land was parceled for grazing and the cutting of wood. Now, in seeking the future, I turned to the records, searching for government aid and knowledge, pondering what a small farmer might do to balance the scales of cost and conservation. In this quest, I found an organic farm, a model of what might be, standing resilient in the same blessed region.",
            "There is a tether between brothers that is not easily severed, a bond forged in the crucible of shared blood and shared experience that cannot be undone. Within it lies a tumult of emotions, love and pride and jealousy and cruelty, vying for space in a heart too small to contain them all. Brothers know each other in ways that no other can, seeing in the other a reflection of themselves. It is when the world bears down with all its weight that this bond reveals its true nature, whether it be light or dark. The cost of clarity is steep, for to understand these emotions is to reckon with their consequences. To look into a brother's eyes and see oneself is to see not the visage the world perceives but the unvarnished truth of one's own soul. It is in the deeds done and the aftermath they leave behind that a man's true character is etched.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this path, their hearts a battleground of emotions as they traverse a landscape that is lush and unforgiving. They embark on a journey doomed to failure, where bitter disappointment and fierce pride clash in a moment that leaves only one brother standing. This theme unfurls through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and the interplay between him and his brother, narrated in a voice heavy with the weight of complex feelings and a world perceived through the narrow lens of youth.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by one emotion above all: pride. From the first venture with his frail brother, Doodle, to their final, ill-fated journey, resentment festers in his heart. He had envisioned a brother to whom he could impart the secrets of the world, the art of holding breath, the thrill of running, the joy of climbing the vines that hung in Old Woman Swamp. A companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with him in the great pine's highest fork behind the barn. Yet Doodle, born with a heart weak as a moth's wing, could not fulfill these dreams. The young boy's fantasies were shattered, his dreams dashed in an instant.\n\nIn his anger, the thought of ending the small child's life flickered through his mind, a dark thread in the tapestry of his thoughts. What child, in the innocence of youth, harbors such grim thoughts? And yet, when Doodle smiled at him, the darkness receded. That simple act kindled hope in his heart, revealing that the desire to harm was but a shadow, insubstantial against the deep-rooted love he held for his brother. It was instinctive, a bond unbreakable despite the tumult within.",
            "The human mind is a labyrinthine creation, a web of thought and memory, a vessel of mystery. In ages past, as man rose from the dust and forged tools from stone, so did his understanding of the mind evolve from simple to profound. At first, it was likened to clay, then to parchment, then to the written page, and now to the machine of silicon and light. Yet, let not these comparisons deceive, for they are but shadows on the wall, prone to lead astray.\n\nIn the beginning, there is the world. The senses stand as sentinels at the gate, transforming the raw and the real—touch, heat, the echo of sound, the dance of light—into the language of the mind, a dialogue of electricity and chemistry. This information, thus transformed, journeys through the labyrinth, guided by the unseen hand of the brain’s own making. It rises from the ground up, building from the base elements of color and line, the boundaries where one thing ends and another begins, to form the whole. And yet, from above, from the heights of knowing, the mind descends to meet it, shaping understanding with what it has learned before, until one sees not just a box of black upon white, but knows it for what it is.\n\nAttention, that fickle arbiter, stands watchful, determining what shall pass and what shall fade into the backdrop of the mind’s eye. A thousand blades of grass may sway beneath one’s gaze, yet the mind chooses to see but the ground beneath the feet. And yet, in the clamor of voices, it plucks a name from the air, sharp and clear. Through this dance of perception, the mind moves, ever refining, ever deciding.\n\nFor the mind to weave its intricate patterns, it must first gather and store the threads of thought. Memory is its loom, with many chambers—sensory, immediate, enduring. It begins with the act of encoding, a translation into forms that the mind may hold. Words may be seen, heard, or known in essence, each pathway its own. Once captured, these threads of memory are held by the mind’s unseen hands. In fleeting moments, they are recalled by an electric dance between neurons. In the depths of time, they rest in the architecture of life itself, woven into the fabric of being.\n\nAnd so, the mind constructs its knowledge, laying pathways that echo the steps of thought, some crafted by the mind’s own recall, others by the models of machine or the laws of nature. Concepts link one to another, a tapestry of meaning—“chair” to “table,” “table” to “wooden,” each connected by the invisible threads of understanding.",
            "In the year 2007, the United States of America found itself mired in a financial tempest that swept the land with an unforgiving hand. Unemployment rose like a specter in the night, the housing market crumbled into dust, and the great monoliths of American enterprise lay shattered in their own ruin. This recession, a specter that haunts the present, demands that we ask: what conspired to bring about this calamity, and what must be done to stave off such dark tides? In the starkest of terms, the crisis was birthed from the loins of selfish and myopic political maneuverings that coerced banks and enterprises to cast sub-prime loans into an already faltering and unsteady financial edifice. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not free from the yoke, forced to underwrite and reforge these mortgages into constructs of collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. When the borrowers faltered under the weight of their debts, the banks, bereft of capital reserves, transferred this chaos onto the repackaged mortgages they had pawned off, cascading the turmoil through the sinews of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this financial maelstrom can be traced back to the twilight of the millennium, in 1999, during the Clinton era. The President, in his quest for a second tenure, sought to bolster his standing among the populace. In pursuit of this aim, the Clinton administration unshackled lending restrictions, setting the stage for the impending sub-prime debacle that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times bore witness to these machinations in 1999, chronicling that Fannie Mae, the nation's foremost underwriter of home mortgages, was under mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to extend mortgage loans to those of lesser means, all while appeasing shareholders with promises of ever-growing profits. Holmes, with a prophet's foresight, discerned the harbinger of doom: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" And as the introduction has laid bare, and as Holmes foretold, reckless lending was to be the harbinger of the economy's unraveling.\n\nA confluence of forces converged to hurl the economy into chaos, not least of which was the novel and intricate design of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations were wielded with reckless abandon in the years preceding the crisis, serving only to bind more threads of the economy to the fate of the housing market. This left American households, and the financial markets writ large, overextended and perilously susceptible to even the minutest tremors in home prices.\n\nInevitably, the housing bubble burst, and the financial strongholds that had embraced these mortgage-backed securities found themselves betrayed. The five titans of U.S. investment banks collectively bore $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts by 2007, a sum that comprised nearly a third of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were relinquished for a pittance, Lehman Brothers disintegrated into the void, and Goldman Sachs along with Morgan Stanley were compelled to transform into commercial banks, shackled by stringent regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened under $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were subsumed under government control by September of 2008.",
            "Exposition. That stretch of narrative where a writer unfurls their wings, casting spells of prose to captivate or to lull into the gentle embrace of oblivion. A place where the audience may drift to sleep or retreat from the story's embrace with curses upon their lips. Dr. Merlin, in her encounters with an excess of information, has been known to rail at her screen, bereft of the fun such indulgence might offer.\n\nExposition is a shadow that trails your every move.\n\nThose who read with care know the old adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in the webs of narration where nothing stirs, or where chaos reigns unchecked. Exposition is the whispering imp on your shoulder, urging you to lay bare the past so the tale may find its path, not to be mistaken for the other imp, which entices you to unfurl the entirety of a character's youth.\n\nExposition is the recounting of the past, often in stark prose. In the realm of film, it unfurls when one soul shares with another a torrent of knowledge akin to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In the written word, it is the author's voice that weaves this tapestry.\n\nConsider this: as you traverse a tale, you learn of a heroine who met her love in a time and place, of their grand union, and of the grim fate that befell her husband before her eyes. You would not foresee such a profound story to be confined to mere pages where their voices are but whispers in the wind. You would seek the depth of the husband's soul, revealed in his words and deeds, to understand the breadth of his love for her. Equally, the heroine's heart would be laid bare, her life enriched by his presence, and you would desire the author to paint her journey with vivid strokes, to feel the weight of her loss, drawing you deeper into her world.\n\nYou yearn for substance upon the bare bones of the tale: \"They met, they wed, he perished.\"\n\nAs a storyteller, you must provide that substance. (*glances at metaphor, resigns, presses on*) There is a pull to hasten through certain passages. Perhaps you introduce a new figure, a former Air Force man, now the night guardian of a gas station, twice wed with no offspring, who spends his weekends casting lines into waters, dreaming of owning the very place he tends, and who savored Eggs Benedict at dawn.",
            "I watched the broadcasts come flickering from Columbus, Ohio, and the first of them from NBC 4 on a morning that seemed reluctant to dawn, August 13, 2011. The lead story spun a dark tale from Ashley, Ohio, where a man by the name of Shad Hostettler had taken a knife to his wife, though her name remained wrapped in silence. His visage appeared on the screen, and in his eyes, there was something of the devil's own making. The story, raw and bleeding, was given but two minutes' breath, the scant details laid bare: multiple stabbings, arrest made. A fitting brevity, I reckoned.\n\nNext came the lament of a young man, Travis Buyers, all of eighteen years, felled by gunfire in the shadows of Sharon Woods. Critically injured and no hand of justice yet laid upon a suspect. The SWAT team prowled the scene, but the tale was cut short—perhaps, I thought, because he was from a neighborhood where skin was darker and voices oft unheard. I've long seen how the media's gaze skims lightly over the tragedies of minorities, while the plight of a missing or harmed white child or adult sends them into frenzied cries.\n\nThen came word of a gunshot wound in a Med-Flight helicopter, the bullet's path traced to a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers dangled a five-thousand dollar reward like bait to catch the shadowed shooter.\n\nThe weather turned the narrative next, with rain and thunderstorms looming in the Saturday sky, temperatures to hover in the eighties. The forecast was a mere whisper, a siren call to keep eyes glued to the screen.\n\nA robbery followed, from a UDF on Clime Road, a dark-skinned man in a hoodie casting his shadow over the store. Six feet tall, a lean one hundred and fifty pounds, they said, the color of his skin given undue weight in the telling, like a stone in a small child's pocket.\n\nLastly, the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin, convicted in the trade of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. They spoke of his sentence not in years but in months, three hundred of them, a curious twist perhaps meant to sharpen the sting. Hispanic, they called him, a detail that seemed to bear no real weight in the matter.",
            "In the vast expanse of the financial wilderness, where numbers sway like the tall grass in the prairie, there exists a curious thing known as an ETF, an exchange traded fund. This peculiar entity shadows an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund, yet it bears the markings of flexibility, trading in the open like a lone stock on the plains. The ETF offers the breadth of an index fund combined with the singularity of stock ownership. It allows a man to sell short, to buy on margin, to claim even a single share, and all this with the expense ratios that lay lower than the average mutual fund, like the sun sinking beneath the horizon.\n\nYet, not without its drawbacks, for in this land of promise a commission must be paid on any trade, as if one bartered for cattle or land. The bounty of ETFs lies in their vast variety, and while these benefits shine like the morning sun, the prudent investor must question their existence and measure their reach. Thus, the task falls upon us to examine the ETF known as IHF, to weigh it against the ten mighty holdings that form its backbone, and to discern if the singular ETF stands as tall as a diversified portfolio of those ten stocks. We seek to know if these holdings could be arranged in a manner more advantageous, yielding a sharper ratio or better return.\n\nAmidst this endeavor, we select only the top ten holdings, those that account for 63.58% of the ETF's wealth, for to include all would be a burden too great. These ten hold a tale of their own, each with a percentage of the assets they guard. To understand how these ten reflect the ETF IHF, we must use their current assets, normalized to a perfect hundred, to calculate their weight upon a portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio were constructed solely from these ten in accordance with the ETF's design. The chart of calculations lies before us, a testament to their worth.\n\nFrom this chart, it is clear as the mountain stream that a portfolio of the top ten rises with a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, a climb of 16% in returns. The Beta of these ten stands .12 lower than the ETF in its entirety. It seems a portfolio of these ten could offer greater return with less risk, but the winds of chance whisper that their means may not differ in truth. To measure this, we turn to the standard deviation of each stock, normalized to the perfect hundred, to compare their collective deviation against the ETF IHF's own.\n\nAnd so the journey continues, the numbers like the stars in the night sky, guiding us onward through the vast landscape of finance.",
            "When you look back upon Figure 17, you see how in the third month the number of commuter logs dropped like a stone in a well. It was a sight to make a man ponder on the ways of the world. Why it happened, no one could rightly say. Winter grips the New England campus, and with it comes the reluctance of folks to brave the cold on bicycle or foot, which might explain a portion of the fall. December is the time when the semester closes its weary eyes and students and faculty alike drown in the tides of final work and grades. The commuter log, once a priority, finds itself forgotten, adrift on a sea of pressing matters. Then the holidays come, sweeping all before them, and the campus grows silent with the absence of its people. Classes awaken again in the latter days of January, yet still February logs remain scarce, a mystery unsolved. Perhaps such projects burn bright at the start, only to wane as the novelty fades. To counter such decline, we set forth the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a call to arms that saw logs rise once more. The struggle to keep the project's heart beating was a lesson in overcoming the quiet pull of holiday and semester breaks in the academic world.\n\nAnother obstacle stood, as solid as the mountains, in the love people bear for their cars, the freedom and independence they represent. It's a love rooted deep in the soil of our culture, and to turn people from it requires more than mere words. We offered incentives, prizes to tempt them from their paths: gift certificates to local haunts, the promise of a meal or a warm drink, a massage or a book. But what if the prizes had been grander? A bicycle, a hybrid, or even an electric car? Such offerings might have sparked the interest anew, luring them back to the fold. The nature of the prizes remained constant, a steady note in the project’s song. Yet had we announced, come December, the chance of a bicycle, and in January the lure of a car, perhaps then the engagement would have grown rather than dwindled. It is a thought to stir the imagination, what might have been.",
            "In the dim corridors of the Library of Congress where the ghosts of early cinema whisper, I found myself drawn to the flickering shadows of Edison’s trick films. Fifteen of these spectral reels span the years 1895 to 1901, each one a conjuration of illusion wrought by the alchemy of early editing. My study was a meditation on the poetics of these celluloid phantasms and a dissection of the evolutionary aberrations that emerged in their latter days. At the dawn of the century, these films were as bound to their stages as a moth to the flame, their worlds contained within the rigid confines of a frontal proscenium. The camera, unyielding and static, captured long and medium shots with the fidelity of a solemn witness. Each film a singular breath, one shot, one film.\n\nYet, as the century turned, a few bold visions dared to fracture this orthodoxy, introducing the radical notion of multiple shots. Still, most adhered to the stage-bound artifice, the camera never straying from its steadfast post to follow the actors’ steps. This immobility, a vestige of theatre and vaudeville, shackled the figures to a lateral dance, side-to-side, never towards the lens. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right, tracing a path along the horizontal axis, the camera unmoving, a dispassionate observer as they vanish beyond the frame.\n\nThe proscenium's grip dictated the use of long shots, with medium shots a mere whisper and close-ups an unheard plea. The frames echoed the theatre's grandeur, where the audience's eye embraced the entirety of the spectacle, bounded by the stage’s borders. Actors remained in the midground tableau, close-ups forsaken in the dawn of film.\n\nThese early trick films bore the constraint of a single shot as their narrative vessel, a limitation that confined their length to a minute or less, dictated by the clockwork of frames per second. Their tales were brief and wondrous, vaudeville's magic acts captured with little narrative ambition. Yet, the illusion was a clever deceit, for what seemed a single shot was often a tapestry of many, woven together to conjure apparitions and vanishings. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), the illusion fractures under scrutiny, revealing the seam where Mary's spectral head is severed from her body. Though to the viewer's eye, it remains a singular, haunting vision.",
            "In the gatherings of shadowed halls and timeworn spires, the Gothic Novel stands as a contradiction of old and new, a literary oxymoron as Ian Watt notes in his chronicles of its ascent. This Gothic form, maligned and exalted in equal measure, has been accused of lacking depth even as it conjures the 'terrible sublime' that Burke would speak of in hushed tones. The birth of this literary specter traces back to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a conjuring of both ancient and modern romance to forge a new path through the world of letters. Walpole, with a craftsman’s eye, wove together the old theatrics and the mimicry of nature that the modern novel offered, and in this alchemy, he penned what he would call \"A Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic genre is a tapestry woven from the threads of medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even as The Castle of Otranto met the world, the word \"Gothic\" bore the weight of many meanings, stretching across peoples, styles, and ages. It seemed a relic, unsophisticated in the harsh gaze of modernity's march. Yet it was this very mingling of the theatrical and the novel's new form, with its gaze into the heart of its characters, that let the Gothic endure, ever ancient yet forever new to eyes far removed from its birth.\n\nAmong the shadows of Gothic thought, the specter of Chivalry walks, a relic of medieval honor and the knightly path. In The Castle of Otranto, this old chivalric code is both preserved and transformed. For Gothic scribes, the idea of chivalry held a sacred importance—it evoked the noble knight, steadfast and true, a stark contrast to the absence of such ideals they perceived around them. Through these chivalric echoes, the Gothic past became a canvas of idealization, a hint of Romanticism yet to come, an attempt to cast a light upon the present’s shadows. Walpole, amidst the turmoil of his times, despaired at the world’s trajectory. Engulfed by the political storm and its accusations, he may have pondered the loss of the Gothic era's moral compass within the hearts of his contemporaries. This musing finds a face in Frederic, a character hewn from the stone of chivalric tradition.\n\nFrederic's tale is told before his entry, painted in images of chivalry. A prince once, his life marked by suffering and tragedy, lost to the world by infidel hands. In Frederic, the gallant knight takes form, an image stretched to the edge of excess, heralding the Gothic penchant for the grandiose.",
            "In the dim recesses of industry, where the hum of machinery echoes like a distant thunder, there lies the intricate dance of supply chain management. It's a procession, from the moment a customer’s desire is whispered into the ether, through the raw, unformed materials, till the goods are birthed, handed over from one unseen hand to another, till they reach that final resting place in the consumer’s grasp. This notion, this orchestration of movement and time, was laid forth in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver, who envisioned the path of goods as a tapestry woven with intent, planning, and control, all to meet the whims of want in a manner swift and sure. Six pillars uphold this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and the ghostly strands of information that tie them all.\n\nThe forge of production sits at the heart of this process, the molten core from which all else flows. It is here that the when and why and where and how are etched into the stone of intent. The managers, those stewards of commerce, peer into the market, that roiling sea of demand, to glean the desires of the masses. They chart their course, deciding what shall be made and in what measure, choosing the ground where these things shall spring into being, ever mindful of the twin gods of volume and quality, and the needful satisfaction of those who await. And once the place is set, the gears of scheduling turn, the machines are tended, for in the minutiae lies the salvation or the downfall of the enterprise. Missteps here are costly, and the reckoning comes swift. In my own wanderings through the labyrinthine aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, I have seen the doctrine laid bare—a uniformity in attire, a precision in the reception of goods, a testament to the power of outlined processes to stave off the chaos that ever lurks at the edges.\n\nSupply, the second pillar, stands in the shadow of production, casting its own light upon the path. It is the art of choosing, of deciding which capabilities to cultivate within the walls of the facility and which to entrust to the hands of others. A single product may be born in many places, each division a cog in the greater machine, each with its own tools, its own people, its own craft. The manager’s eye must discern which piece fits where, or if the work shall be cast out to others, to partners in this grand endeavor. For in outsourcing lies the promise of velocity—the speed and grace to provide what is needed, when it is needed, without the burden of excessive cost. And so the dance continues, a delicate balance of power and trust, the symphony of supply chain management ever playing to the tune of demand.",
            "Victorian novels, with their ornate tapestries of detail and their unyielding gaze upon the aristocracy, chart a course through the history of an age. Yet from amidst this grand procession emerge two tales that wander from the well-trodden path: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels, with their enigmatic mysteries and the strange, bewildering turns of the bizarre, carve out a realm where characters are not merely drawn but etched deep, their motives and hearts laid bare under the scrutiny of shadows and dreams.\n\nAnd in that shadowed world, Oliver, beset by visions, walks again with the specters of Sikes and Crackit. Their quarrels echo in his mind, a relentless clamor, even as he finds himself speaking to them in the solitude of his thoughts. The sudden crack of gunfire seizes him, cries and shouts erupting as though the very night itself had awakened. Lights flash before his eyes, chaos surrounds him, and some unseen force sweeps him away. Through this tumult, there persists a constant ache, a torment that gnaws at him with an unyielding hunger.\n\nIn these novels, the dreams and visions serve as portals to inner truths, each one a revelation of the soul's hidden landscape. In Oliver Twist, the strange visions tear at the veil of the ordinary, exposing the raw nerves of Oliver's existence. As he relives the shooting in the depths of his mind, the scene unfolds with dreamlike clarity, a testament to his powerlessness against the forces that shape his fate. The hands that bear him away are unseen, the pain an ever-present specter, now entwined with fear rather than shrouded in the numbness of shock. The question looms large: whose design has wrought this suffering upon him? For it is not of his own making. This episode underscores the futility of Oliver's struggle for agency, even as his very life hangs by a thread. The specter of defeat hovers over him, as if old Fagin's shadow had begun to creep into his soul, urging him to surrender to despair, to abandon the fight. Yet somewhere within, a flicker remains, a quiet defiance that refuses to be entirely extinguished.\n\nThe day passed off—day! There was no day; it vanished as swiftly as it came—and night descended once more, a night endless in its dreadful hush, fleeting in its swift passage of hours.",
            "Years back, I found myself in the halls and classrooms of an after school refuge, a place where young minds, elementary and eager, came to wrestle with their lessons. My own inclinations lay in the labyrinth of language, English and the written word my favored realms. It was there that a teacher sought my aid for a boy named Adrian, a lad of perhaps eight or nine years, adrift in the sea of letters. His struggle, it seemed, was not with the words themselves but with the very symbols that made them. Some letters he grasped as if by instinct, others eluded him entirely, a dance of comprehension and confusion. He was Latino, of that there was no question, yet his English was flawless, untainted by any accent. We battled onward, he and I, until the day his mother darkened the doorway. I was watching over the few left behind, when she arrived, her speech a cascade of Spanish, a tongue I barely managed to navigate. But in those halting exchanges, the truth fell upon me with the weight of a revelation: Adrian's battle was with the alphabet itself, not the reading. Whether this epiphany served him well, I cannot say, but in my heart, I hope he found his way.\n\nI recount this tale to illuminate the chasm of language that looms in our schools, a chasm deepened here in the lands of California. It serves to remind that the barriers are not always where we expect them. A child may speak the language of his peers with ease yet find the page an insurmountable wall. This is a truth we must reckon with. So, what is to be done? In Adrian's case, the answer lay in the simple act of tutoring, a focus on the letters and their sounds. Yet for those whose tongues are not yet shaped by English, the path is fraught with complexity. There is no single remedy. The dual language system, the immersion, the tutors, the ESL classes, each a tool, none a cure by itself. The answer lies in their union.\n\nThe dual language path is a worthy venture, not merely for the children of Spanish tongues, but for all. Studies speak of children in bilingual programs surpassing their peers, an achievement not confined to the few. Fear lingers, a specter of wasted effort, a belief that most gain nothing. But this is a falsehood. Make these programs the standard, not the exception, and all will rise. Yet, how to achieve this? Must we demand our teachers speak in two tongues? No, such a demand is folly. But there is no reason we cannot bring forth a cadre of aides, tutors, call them what you will, who bridge this gap with their bilingual voices.",
            "From the first whispers of consciousness we are told of a force greater than ourselves, vast and unknowable. Some are led to chapels and others to synagogues, while others seek within the silence of their own hearts. We are handed down the faiths of our fathers and many accept them without question, yet there are those who turn away, dismissing the unseen in their self-centered world. In the course of our lives, we may embrace one creed and later cast it aside for another. We walk various paths, each seeking to understand our place in the cosmos through the lens of our own spiritual perceptions. In the shadows, we search for a light to guide us to the dawn.\n\nA cardinal, my father said when I inquired of his favored bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof above, sharing cigarettes. The water poured from the gutters, drowning the plants that clung to the edge of the porch. His eyes were fixed on the rain, lost in a gaze that seemed to see beyond the present. He had grown gaunt these past months, his clothes hanging loose as if they belonged to another man. His hair had thinned, a sparse memory of what once was. Still, he stared into the rain, never meeting my eyes. I felt the solitude between us, the fear of speaking the words that would make real what we both knew. I embraced him, then settled back, drawing my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the dim light of June’s end.\n\nHe left this world that December, five days past my twenty-second year. The poison and the fire of treatment had not lessened his pain, but only stretched his days beyond the doctors’ reckonings; what worth in such prolonged suffering I could not say. I questioned the nature of a God who would allow such cruelty. Alone in the darkness, I found no prayers left in me. If there was a God, I felt he had turned his ear from me long ago.\n\nI could not bear witness to his passing from this life. I chose not to. I wished to remember him in life, not in the shadow of death. I knew him, perhaps better than any, and knew he would not want me there in those final moments. So I lay curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the news that never came.\n\nNo one thought to call.",
            "In the rolling fields of Caroline where the soil lay dark and fertile, there stood a man named John Taylor, who with the fervor of a prophet, championed the cause of Republicanism. A farmer by trade, yet his voice echoed in the chambers of power, a testament to his fervent belief in the liberty of men and the restraint of government. His conviction in the agrarian way colored every word he spoke on sovereignty, on the sanctity of the Constitution, and even upon the courts of law.\n\nJohn Taylor saw in the young nation of the United States a canvas unspoiled, unblemished by the burdens of old traditions. Here was a land where men could craft with their own hands a government of self-rule. He held fast to the natural rights of man, these rights entwined like the roots of old trees, so that in denying one, the whole would wither. Such rights, he declared, must remain out of the grasp of any mortal government. In the brutish state of nature, it was the strong of arm and dark of mind who thrived, but within the bounds of civilization, such must not be.\n\nTo forge this society, Taylor said, the government must reckon with the dual nature of man, his capacity for both good and evil. His creed was simple, yet stern, that all virtues and vices of governance were but reflections of human nature. Good principles, he claimed, were those that safeguarded private land, nurtured the crops that sprang from it, and turned away from the lure of unchecked commerce. A government rooted in such principles would stand fair, despite the inevitable sway of those who lead with greed. Self-interest, he mused, drives all men, yet it turns foul when it births enclaves that flourish at the cost of others. A vigilant government was needed to keep man's darker instincts in check, ever wary of the creeping shadow of ill principles.\n\nAmong the chorus of Republican voices, Taylor's was steadfast, calling for a Constitution held tight to its written word. He envisioned a Federal government constrained, with powers no greater than those written clear upon the parchment. An expansive government meant an expensive one, and he saw in that the seeds of tyranny. Yet he warned against a mere literal reading of the text, for without the light of the framers' intent, corruption could easily take root. To Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true heart of the nation, a testament not to a singular entity, but to a union of sovereign states, each with its own soul.",
            "The world lay still before me, a tableau untouched by time, and I gazed upon it with a mind as unyielding and indifferent as the earth itself. No tether to abstraction disturbed my view, no whisper of understanding, for mine was a study of the visible and nothing beyond. Thoughts drifted like ghosts, ephemeral and unclaimed, the mind a smooth stone upon which the stream of perception flowed, untroubled and clear.\n\nOnce, at the urging of an artist I’d known, I procured a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I’d longed to draw since boyhood, six years tender and yearning for the secrets held in a pencil's line. The book promised to reveal all, from the mystery of graphite to the alchemy of perception. It taught, among other things, the framing of a picture, to distill chaos into clarity—a bowl of fruit on a table, a universe contained within a frame.\n\nYet there, before the bowl, I stood unable to conjure such a frame. Overwhelmed I was, awestruck and silent. The greats had their phases and palettes—Picasso his blue, Monet his green, the masters their prismed hues. And here I stood, at the dawn of my own work, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers found the instrument of my art, muscles taut and obedient, and the air parted as my will became form. Water danced, clear and sure, flecks of existence surrendered to the void. Muscles clenched again, more insistent, and the hand drove the handle down. Still, the brown mass clung stubbornly, an unwelcome guest in porcelain confines.\n\nWith mop in hand, stance firm, and a tie strangling my neck, I surveyed the crude testament left behind in the Rite Aid restroom. Flush after futile flush, and moments of quiet reflection passed, until I reached for the paper, a makeshift gauntlet forming around my hand. Straightening, then bending, I plunged into the bowl, a mother reclaiming her Thanksgiving fowl...",
            "The roads become a battleground where the young meet their end, their lives snuffed out behind the wheel. There's a confluence of factors that shape this grim ledger of statistics for the youngest of drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health speak of the adolescent mind, unripe and unready for the perils of the open road. Inexperience, too, stands at the core, a silent specter leading them to their doom. It is this lack of experience that not only brings about fatal collisions but an increase in vehicles overturned, a reckless speed, and the veering off into oblivion.\n\nWhen they gather with their kin, the outcome is far more dire, a truth evident to any soul with a shred of sense, for these young riders often travel in packs. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center reveals a stark correlation: the age of those riding alongside and the frequency of wrecks upon the road.\n\nIn places like California, the law seeks to shield these fledgling drivers by imposing provisional licenses that curtail their hours and banish other young passengers from their company. Yet these provisional measures are but a patch upon a greater wound. The truth is plain: these youngest among us, by any measure of statistics, are ill-prepared to shoulder the weight of the wheel. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman holds that even eighteen is too tender an age for the granting of a full license. USA Today bears witness to his findings, revealing a penchant in those not yet twenty to court danger for the heady rush it imparts. It stands to reason then, to defer the granting of this privilege until the fever of thrill-seeking begins to wane. If we persist in bestowing licenses upon these young souls, the carnage will not cease; the death toll shall swell to unthinkable numbers in the coming years. As the children of the Baby Boomers come of age to drive, millions more will take to the highways.\n\nThe crafting of laws to address this need not be a complex affair. Schools might continue the instruction of driving to prepare those who will one day take the wheel, yet none younger than eighteen ought to command a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be given in the time before a full license is awarded, with practical training hours mandated. The number of hours might mirror what states currently require; in California, six hours of wheel-time and fifty in the company of an elder. Given the deadly data drawn from across the nation, a uniform law to guard young drivers would be a reasonable—and I dare say effective—step in securing the safety of our youth.\n\nSuch legislation is not a novel concept, but one of necessity and sense.",
            "In the quiet corridors of the mind's vast expanse, where shadows whisper and echoes linger, there lies a disorder by the name of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, a malady not of the ears but of the soul's perception. It is here that we begin, unfolding the tale of a brain's struggle to make sense of the sounds that dance around it. First, we must define this affliction, and then, we shall peer into the means by which it is known, marked by signs and signals like distant smoke on the horizon. Lastly, we turn our gaze to the classrooms, where teachers, like weary sentinels, seek to guide those beset by CAPD through the fog of misunderstanding.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder as some have called it, speaks to the enigma of the central nervous system's dance with the auditory world. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, in their wisdom of 2005, spoke of it as the CNS's art of utilizing sound, where the fault lies not in hearing but in the alchemy of translation. The ears hear, yet the mind falters, unable to separate the song from the silence, the voice from the void.\n\nIn the annals of history, its earliest echoes resound from the mid-1950s, cloaked in the name of 'auditory imperception.' It was then that pioneers such as Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began their work, crafting tests in the year 1954. Kimura, in 1961, brought forth dichotic testing, weaving a model to unveil the mysteries of the central auditory nervous system. A gathering of minds in 1977 kindled the fires of inquiry into the children who bore this burden.\n\nCAPD reveals itself in myriad forms, a specter of sound and silence. The afflicted may wander through the world unable to discern sound's origin, or fail to tell one noise from another. Patterns of sound elude them, and the cadence of speech, with its subtle shifts, remains a riddle. The past sound is swallowed by the present, and the clues that others weave into meaning are lost upon them, as is the sequence of auditory events.\n\nTo diagnose this specter, one must embark on a journey of observation, through the systematic witnessing of listening and the trials of auditory function. Audiologists, SLPs, and psychologists are the seekers, wielding questionnaires and surveys, their eyes keen upon the behavior of the listener. Yet, no single test holds the key, no cause is known, and the path to understanding remains shrouded. Tests present a cacophony, asking of the listener a deciphering of words and numbers, while others delve deeper, recording the responses within the ear's hidden chambers.\n\nIn the end, CAPD is a silent struggle, a battle waged within, where the ears are but the gatekeepers to a mind that seeks to understand the world it hears, yet finds itself lost amidst the echoes.",
            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, my path leads toward the Division of Family and Children Services, a road marked by the desire to mend what has been broken, to shield the young who have known only neglect or abuse, and to offer a hand to families adrift in the storm. The values I carry into this field are more than mere words; they are the bricks and mortar of my being—service, respect, an unwavering ethical compass, a commitment to better the bonds between people, and a relentless drive to hone my skills so that I remain ever worthy of the task. These values are not solely the province of the social worker; they are the quiet truth of who I am.\n\nFrom my earliest days, the longing to aid others was a constant companion, though the road ahead lay obscured by shadows. High school and college unfolded before me, a parade of souls fleeing from their own shadows, some stumbling into the arms of poor solace. Witness to these struggles, I turned my steps toward a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Yet the path remained elusive, and so I paused upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, fate led me to a friend’s home, where a boy of sixteen sat upon her couch, his eyes wide with the fear of one seeking refuge from the cruelties of his own blood. The tale unfolded—an escape from abuse—and the next dawn brought news that he had called the law to stand against his kin. I went to that place where his parents dwelt, seeking to lend aid, and spoke my concerns to the officers who could do little more than listen. They bid me speak with the parents, and I did, the truth of my fresh degree a thin armor as I faced their nervous words, their justifications for what the boy had done. In that moment, the thought took root within me—a calling to the work of healing such \"simple\" disputes.\n\nIn this calling, there is also the fierce heart of social justice. Society proclaims the worth of the individual, yet in its mourning for the lost, it clings to traditions that bind rather than liberate. If we weep for those who pass, why do we shackle ourselves to the sameness of all? I am an individual, and I reject the chains that would make me otherwise. In the halls of high school and college, I raised my voice against the injustices I saw—my hair a palette of defiance, my clothes a banner of self, my ears adorned beyond the ordinary. I stood with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, stood against the specter of racism and discrimination, whenever and wherever they reared their heads. For social justice is my creed, and I shall not cease in my protest against the injustices of this world.",
            "In the dim corridor of human understanding, there lies the restless specter of insomnia, a disorder as ancient as the stars and as confounding as the shifting sands. This paper, like a lone traveler, seeks to unravel the tangled threads of its origins, peering through the lenses of the Biological and Sociocultural models. The biological model casts its gaze upon the bloodlines, the inheritance of genes and the medical tapestry woven through the flesh. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural model turns its eye to the world outside, the interplay of environment, race, and the unyielding march of socioeconomic forces. This review, a journey through the night, examines the chosen research, explaining, critiquing, and laying bare the strengths and weaknesses found therein.\n\nSleep disorders, those silent thieves of the night, come in many forms. They may stand alone as primary disorders or walk hand in hand with the shadows of mental affliction. The Dyssomnias, those guardians of sleep's gate, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, and Narcolepsy, each a tale of its own. Primary Insomnia, a thief of slumber, while Primary Hypersomnia, a struggle to remain awake, both haunting their victims for no less than a month. Narcolepsy, with its sudden descents into the abyss, speaks of cataplexy and the automatic descent into dreams. The Parasomnias, in contrast, are specters of the night, causing nightmares, terrors, and sleepwalking, each a dance of the mind's shadows. The disorders tethered to mental afflictions, linked to the Axis I and Axis II, weave another story. This review lingers on insomnia, a focus upon the biological and sociocultural realms.\n\nThe biological model, a study of the codes within us, speaks of genes, heritable whispers, and the physiological web that binds. In the hypothalamus, neurons laced with orexin hold the keys to the kingdom of sleep and wakefulness. Studies with mice, those tiny wanderers of science, reveal GABAB receptors on these neurons, gatekeepers of slumber and alertness. Activation of the GABAA receptor ushers in sleep, while its silence brings forth anxiety and wakefulness. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, lengthens the night's embrace (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings, etched in the annals of research, suggest that the mice's tale may echo in the human heart. The genetic and environmental underpinnings of the GABAB receptor unveil a truth: its absence or malfunction may render sleep elusive. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is passed down, it may cast a shadow over life's endeavors, dimming the prospects of learning, work, and the daily grind of existence. And so, the study of insomnia, a journey through the darkness, seeks to illuminate the path forward.",
            "I've roamed these grounds at University Park for nigh on two and a half years now. The corridors of time marked by four and a half semesters. For many and myself among them, the labyrinth of campus is a trial. My first year saw me nestled in an East Halls dormitory, perched at the easternmost edge of this scholar's domain, save for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center's vastness. From my quarters in Stuart Hall to the distant precincts of Willard building, a pilgrimage to the heart of campus demanded twenty-five minutes or more, a journey aggravated by the whims of State College weather. In conversation with an alumnus, a soul not much older than myself, I gleaned tales of yore when East Halls stood apart, isolated by fields of barren earth. Now the void is filled, sports fields and colossal structures like the new Creamery and health services building rising up, apartments encircling them. As the campus sprawls ever outward, the burden of distance grows heavier. How best to traverse this widening expanse? The answer lies in the bicycle. Yet the bicycle alone is but half the battle. Riders must mount them, and the paths must welcome their wheels.\n\nI spoke with a friend, one who had recently returned to the saddle after years away. He pondered aloud why he ever dismounted. \"Bikes are grand,\" he declared. \"Once, it wasn't the fashion to ride, but it's the only way to roam.\" Beyond fortifying the body, the bicycle is a paragon of efficiency. A humble bowl of oatmeal and the turn of a pedal can carry you thirty miles or more. Like many a student, I've taken residence off campus, distances akin to those dormitories. The wisest choice I've made this year was to acquire a bike. Each day, my path leads to Thomas building, a place that demands twenty-five minutes on foot from my door. A bicycle reduces that time to five, if I am swift and the road favors me. Yet the straightforward path of Pollock Road is fraught, a challenge whether mounted or on foot. There are merits in walking, but time is a luxury I do not possess. Without my bike, walking would be my sole recourse, a drain of thirty to forty minutes each day. Hours lost each week, time I cannot afford to squander.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dark vision of a world remade by the hands of men, he lays bare the creeping machinations of technology and the relentless march of capitalism, crafting a realm where the soul is subjugated to the whims of the machine. This brave new world, a place where the collective voice drowns out the solitary whisper, molds its people from birth to seek only the fleeting balm of immediate pleasure. Within this tapestry, the citizens are revealed as mere pieces in a grandiose game, their minds shackled to the dictates of the World Controller. Through the lens of Marxist thought, one glimpses Huxley's wary eye cast upon the constructs of his age. The jargon of Marxism—homogeny, reification—lurks within the narrative, underscoring the novel's commentary on the flaws of the burgeoning economy that rose around him.\n\nIn this satire of capitalism, the specter of false consciousness looms large. The common folk, blind to the chains that bind them to their economic fates, pursue self-interest in a dance orchestrated by unseen hands. This, the fruit of ideological dominion over the masses, stands starkly in Huxley's world. The Delta, the Gamma, and their ilk, robbed of true volition, are driven by the whispers of hypnopædia to consume, to spend, to indulge. Their strings pulled by the World Controller, who enacts a hegemony over their lives, a dominance where the many unknowingly uphold the very structure that ensnares them. The Alphas and Betas, aware yet silent, save for a few like Bernard who dare to question. In this interplay of castes, the heavy hand of capitalism's perceived oppression is made manifest.\n\nIn Huxley's creation, the bonds between souls are mere shadows. The novel draws no lines to separate its players, for even those who stand in the light are but hollow echoes. Here, he suggests that the rise of the machine and the market strips man of his will, his essence. Love is a ghost, and the peaks of emotion are leveled to the plain. Interactions are but surfaces, the men's talk of women reduced to the pneumatic, the women unabashed in their tales of encounters. The unquestioning acceptance of their place within the hierarchy speaks to the socioeconomic toll of capitalism. Their obedience, their unyielding role in the collective, mirrors the Marxist view of the proletariat, led to believe in their own supremacy so long as they consume, conform, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "It was near four years past when I found myself enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A crucible of debate it was, with the class grappling fiercely over the nature of Islam itself, whether it bore hostility in its heart. The question lingers yet, more pertinent perhaps than it ever was. The shadow of 9/11 cast long, and I watched as the media scape shifted, from a scornful gaze upon Islam and its zealots to a peculiar tolerance within the bounds of America. In the year of 2001, it would have been unthinkable for a man named Barack Obama, whose lineage traced to Muslim roots, to stand as a presidential contender.\n\nThe life of the Prophet stirs my interest, for in it I see a dance of contradictions. The history I’ve known paints Muhammad as a conqueror, wielding the sword to spread the faith among tribes. Yet the biographers pen a different tale, casting him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, drawing followers not by force but by the truth they perceived in his teachings. They came to him, so the story goes, as moths are drawn to flame.\n\nThere are echoes of another ministry, that of Jesus, in this narrative of Muhammad’s wonders. The multiplication of mutton and milk for forty men, a miracle reminiscent of the loaves and fishes. I sense the writers’ intent, to craft an image of a prophet unbothered by proof, instead living a life suffused with truth and miracles. Yet, such a portrayal seems to diminish the singular life of Christ, as though they would borrow glory from one to bestow upon another.\n\nIn the biography’s tales, one sees a pattern, a need to establish witness, to mark the conversion to Islam as a voluntary revelation. But the stories often wend their way through the mouths of others, a hearsay chain of so-and-so heard from so-and-so. It leaves the tales suspect, their truth diluted by the distance of voices.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the elevation of Muhammad to a stature of saintly humility and wisdom, a gentle soul. Yet the chronicles of history seem to sing a different song, a discordant tune against this image. I wonder if those who follow Islam today perceive these truths, the history that lies beneath the legend of Muhammad’s ascent.",
            "In the dust of centuries past, the teachings of the Nazarene lay like forgotten stones, left behind by those who sought to build upon them towers of doctrine reaching skyward. In the sweep of history, one sees the faith of Christ drawn ever further from its humble origins, a river swollen and diverted, its course altered by time and the hands of men. The world now turns with a restless awareness, a stirring in the hearts of many toward a horizon not yet seen. Those who cling to the old ways, rooted in tradition, stand steadfast, but their numbers wane, and their voices, though loud, may not carry the weight to halt the tide.\n\nAmidst the faithful, a seed of understanding takes root, a reckoning with the layers laid upon the simple truth long ago. There will be a yearning, a hunger to peel back the years, to strip away the accretions of centuries, and to gaze once more upon the face of the Christ, unadorned and pure. It is a slow turning, a movement that may take the span of lifetimes, but it is inexorable. A great reversal looms on the horizon, a return to the ancient path, a shedding of the burdens of doctrine, down to the bare earth of the man from Galilee.\n\nAs this reversion sweeps across the lands, from the shores of the New World to the old streets of Europe, it will gather the faithful in its wake, drawing them together in a unity of purpose unseen for generations. The church will stand resolute, a shepherd to guide this flock, yet the diversity that once scattered the faithful like seeds upon the wind will coalesce into a singular vision. The distinctions that once divided them—denominations, creeds, and theologies—will blur into a harmony of belief, a testament to the power of a shared journey back to the source.\n\nHistory is a tapestry woven with reversals, a testament to the cycles of human endeavor. The Romans once hunted the followers of Christ, only to later embrace the cross themselves. Our own nation has seen the chains of slavery broken, rising to a place where those once oppressed now lead. And so it will be with this coming reversion, as the faithful seek to unweave the threads of time, to return to the spring from which their faith first flowed. It is a journey that will be guided by a reading of the Nazarene’s words not as rigid law, but as parable and metaphor, a map to guide the soul.\n\nIn the mists of ancient days, before the man from Nazareth walked the dusty roads of Judea, there was only Judaism, the soil from which the new faith would grow. Monotheism, revelation, and the sacred texts of the Hebrews were the bedrock upon which the Romans, in their conquest of Jerusalem, found a people divided—not as one, but in the many faces of Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the nameless multitudes who lived and died by the law. And so, one asks, what has become of this faith since those distant days?",
            "In the gloom of the ironworks and the ceaseless clangor of industry, The Jungle lays bare the raw and unyielding truth of man's nature, a truth steeped in avarice and self-interest. Beneath the facade of civility lies a relentless quest for self-betterment, a pursuit blind to the plight of those who dwell in the shadows below. The tale unfolds within the labyrinthine corridors of the great factories, overseen by owners and managers whose eyes are fixed solely on the expansion of their empires. Their hearts are hardened against the cries of those trampled underfoot, the casualties of their relentless march toward progress. Upton Sinclair's vision is stark, his words painting the sky as a canvas of dark defilement, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A testament to the disregard these titans hold for all that is caught in their wake, be it man or beast, the smoke rises unceasingly, a harbinger of ruin.\n\nWithin this realm of iron and smoke, the well-being of the laborer is cast aside, a mere afterthought in the ledger of wealth. The men who toil within are cogs in a machine, their lives exchanged for the promise of another dollar. Sinclair's words cut to the bone, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The laborers are driven without mercy, their hours long and their recompense paltry, until the day they are discarded, without warning or recourse, to fend for themselves in a world devoid of safety nets. In this era of unbridled capitalism, laws are but whispers against the gale, and the owners reign unchecked, demanding ever more from their workers who toil under the weight of impossible demands. Though Sinclair's narrative does not voice it outright, the silent expectation is clear: endure the torment, for there is no salvation to be found. No agency offers solace, no hand extends in aid. The unions, conceived as bastions of hope, become yet another cog in the infernal machine, exploiting the very souls they claim to protect. The workers, ensnared in this relentless grind, are likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" Thus, the cycle turns unbroken, and the cries of the downtrodden echo unanswered into the void.",
            "In the dim corridors of the mind where shadows weave their tales, Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands, a testament to his own claim of mastery. Here, in the lines that speak of \"Thulé,\" an echo from Virgil rises, whispering of that far island beyond Britain's grasp, the edge of what men dared to know. Virgil's voice indeed calls from the past, yet Poe's gaze wandered further, drawn to the Germanic titans of word. \n\nIn this, the specter of Goethe looms large, for Karl J. Arndt, in his musings on \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" finds mirrors in their verses, a mimicry perhaps, or homage. The Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe’s own Faust, a drama of poetic descent, unspooling over the years, its threads concluding in the year Goethe himself found his end, 1832. Within it, a fragment, \"The King of Thulé,\" tells of a monarch whose heart was lost upon a goblet’s gift, his lady gone to the grave. The weight of memory bends him to drink and mourn until he casts his final treasure to the sea's depths and follows it with closed eyes into the abyss.\n\nIn Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" echoes of this king's sorrowful tread can be felt, shadowed reflections of a soul adrift in drink and grief, perhaps a specter of Poe's own losses. Faust's tale found new life in the hands of H P Grattan in '42, mere moons before Poe's own pen inscribed \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nTwice \"Thule\" rings from Poe's collected voice, once in the pit's dark sway, twice in the land of dreams, a refrain that binds the pieces as kin. Within \"Dream-Land,\" the traveler speaks of Thule's desolate expanse, a place where ghosts keep company and color fades to whispers. A land where Goethe's king might wander, burdened by loss and the specter of rule unclaimed, a place where Poe's imagination might find its reflection.\n\nThrough this, Goethe's shadow stretched across Poe's landscape, a presence felt through the tendrils of Tennyson's acclaim. Though the connection is woven by respect and the tides of literary fashion, it is in the echoes and the spaces between words that Poe found Goethe, and in turn, reflected him.",
            "In the sun-drenched land of California, a question arises from the dust and echoes of commerce. Could a soul, wounded by a fall upon spilled applesauce in a grocer's lane, seek the judgment of punitive damages by revealing the store manager's malice? This, because twice he was told of the mess and yet, wrapped in the solitude of supper, let it linger for a half-hour unheeded.\n\nIn the halls of justice, a judge is unlikely to cast aside Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive recompense without due consideration. To weave such a claim, the plaintiff must unfurl evidence that the defendant’s deeds bore a willful and conscious neglect for the likely harm they sowed, and that such deeds were despicable in nature. Palmer might say that Martin should have foreseen the harm of not cleansing the spill, for in the months before her fall, many patrons of D&D had been felled by similar missteps. Knowing this, he still let the spill remain, a testament to his disregard. Her assertion of Martin's despicable nature may falter, yet it stands on the ground that six such slips had occurred in that fateful year, and still, Martin took no steps to ensure his store's safety.\n\nThat day, October 13, 2009, at the hour of five past the meridian, Rich Wayne, in the employ of D&D Markets, approached his overseer, Paul Martin, to speak of an applesauce spill. Martin, steeped in his meal, dismissed the matter, saying he lacked the time for the woes of the customer. Fifteen minutes later, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, sounded the same alarm, and Martin, unyielding, replied in kind. At the half-hour mark, Jennifer Palmer stepped into the tale, slipping upon the spill, her back grievously hurt. Before Palmer's misfortune, five other such tales had unfolded at D&D in that same year. Now, Palmer seeks due redress for her hurt, both in compensatory and punitive terms, as we ponder the path of a motion to dim the punitive claim’s light.\n\nIn this golden state, one may recover punitive recompense for a breach not born of contract if the defendant wore the mantle of “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010) speaks thus. Malice, the law says, is a deed wrought to harm or, if not so intended, must be “despicable” and done with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). The courts have named a deed malicious when done with eyes wide to the peril it brings, yet the doer, with deliberation, let those perils come, as in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always harbored a yearning, a gnawing hunger that eluded fulfillment. It was a specter that took root around her fourteenth summer, as she waded into the tumult of adolescence, and it lingered still, three years hence, at seventeen. In those years, the amorphous need had coalesced into a desire for companionship rather than possession. Yet no boy stirred her interest. Some had attempted to court her with the clumsiness of youth, drawn by her allure, but all fell short of kindling any spark within her. She wrestled with this enigma, pondering the nature of her peculiar indifference, seeking the source of her anomaly with the earnestness of youth. The years of introspection yielded theories, but none substantial enough to anchor her speculation. And so she moved through her days, a soul adrift in her own quiet inquisition.\n\nHome was a bastion of tranquility. Her parents were gentle souls, their discourse seldom marred by discord. They rarely quarreled, even with their daughter, save for the inevitable clashes with her burgeoning independence and spirited nature. She was the offspring of serenity, yet she injected into their lives a vibrancy that was both a counterpoint and a complement to their calm, endearing herself to all with her genuine warmth.\n\nToday, however, tranquility shattered. As she wandered through the rooms, seeking the elusive muse, a cry pierced the air, sharp and sudden, borne from her mother's lips. Panic surged as she raced to the kitchen, her voice rising in urgent inquiry, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay prone, pain etched on her features, each breath a whispered \"Ow.\" The girl rushed to her side, hand outstretched in a futile attempt to alleviate the hurt. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words tumbled out, compressed by agony, and the daughter knew her mother's suffering was profound. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured, and in that instant, the girl was grateful for the strength she had honed in preparation for such unforeseen trials. She bore her mother to the car, laid her gently in the back, and drove with purpose.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a place of antiseptic odors and fraught with the specter of illness, but she was impervious to its atmosphere, her mind singularly fixated on her mother's plight. She carried her swiftly inside, her voice rising to summon aid, and they came, faces etched with concern, laying her mother upon a rolling bed with practiced haste. They whisked her away to urgent care, leaving the daughter ensconced in a cocoon of anxiety.\n\nHer mother had tumbled from a stepping stool, reaching for a vase ensconced in the highest cabinet.",
            "In the course of this study, the aim was to lay bare the truth that the adherence to what is known as the Mediterranean Diet, or the Med diet, as mirrored in a lofty alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, carries with it a lesser burden of chronic heart disease and stroke and even the grim specter of stroke mortality. The aMed diet stands as a variant of the Med diet, distinguished by a greater presence of plant foods, plant proteins too, casting aside the common potato but embracing fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, a favoring of monounsaturated fats over their saturated brethren, and a turn towards the bounty of the sea in fish, while the consumption of animal products and saturated fats wanes. A moderate measure of alcohol finds its place.\n\nThe chronicles of studies past have drawn forth an inverse association between the Med diet and the specter of death both total and cardiovascular, with interventions revealing the Med diet's prowess over a low-fat regimen, guiding to weight loss and a favorable tilt of the scales in cholesterol in those who carry the weight of obesity. Yet, these studies of old did not cast their gaze upon stroke or the mortality it brings.\n\nThis inquiry delved into the lives of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, their pasts unmarked by cardiovascular disease or diabetes, drawn from the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort woven from 121,700 female nurses across 11 states. Across the span from 1984 to 2004, six times over, an aMed diet score was drawn from the self-reported food frequency questionnaires, instruments crafted to capture the essence of their nutrient intake from the year gone by. A steadfast 95% of nurses remained tethered to this study through the two decades. The FFQs underwent the scrutiny of validation. The shadows of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through the examination of medical and hospital records, autopsies, or the finality of death certificates. Where such records were absent, cases were deemed probable and gathered in, with some 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts thus classified. Measures of body mass index, the smoke of cigarettes, the use of aspirin, the intake of multivitamins, menopausal status, and the postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986 onward, the leisure pursuits of physical activity were noted.\n\nTo quell the capriciousness of random variation and to better capture the essence of long-standing dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were taken, melding together scores from two years past. Adjustments were made to account for the confounders, those beguiling factors that could cloud the truth, by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling became the tool with which to discern the relation between an aMed score and the specter of CHD and stroke, separate models crafted for the fatal and the nonfatal, and for the varied strokes.\n\nGreater fidelity to the Mediterranean way, as captured in a loftier aMed diet score, bore a kinship with a lesser risk of CHD and stroke in women. Across two decades of vigilance, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 strokes, and 1077 deaths by cardiovascular disease, the fatal CHD and strokes alike, were recorded. Those women who stood in the top aMed quintile found themselves at a diminished risk for both CHD and stroke when set against those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk standing at 0.71.",
            "The sign proclaimed that Hitler lives in Burma. Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, stood solitary on a street corner, a piece of cardboard hoisted aloft, the message scrawled in Sharpie, stark against the world. Burma, or Myanmar they call it now, a land under the yoke of a military junta, power seized in the coup of '62. In 2007, they rose, the people, the monks in their saffron robes leading the way, the streets alive with the spirit of a decade-long silence broken. The Saffron Revolution they named it, for the color of the robes, for the monks who dared the junta's wrath. At first, the government turned a blind eye, a charade of peace, but the tide turned red and the monasteries became battlegrounds, soldiers storming through sacred halls. Foreign eyes, the lenses of journalists, they were sought out, silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, fell on September 27th, 2007, a casualty of witness. Thirteen dead, they say officially, but Colonel Hla Win, who turned against his own, whispers of thousands, of bodies uncounted and unseen.\n\nThis is the world's old song. Tyranny's hand upon the throats of the dissenters, a tale as aged as time itself. The Romans called their emperors divine, chosen by gods to rule with iron fist. In Japan, the emperors walked as gods among men, heralds of prosperity and ritual, and here in our own land, George W. Bush converses with Ted Haggard, a man steering fools under the banner of the Republic Party.\n\nHistory is littered with such shadows. Tiananmen, June 4th, 1989, where the young and the intellectuals and the workers stood against their rulers. The numbers of the dead, a secret held tight by the Chinese government, spoke of a few hundred, but others tell of thousands fallen. Rwanda's blood-soaked earth in the '90s, Hutu against Tutsi, a government and its militia in lockstep, a genocide. And the specter of Hitler's Reich, where the Jewish people were hunted across nations, a dark chapter etched in the annals of time.\n\nThis tale is old, and still, it unfolds.",
            "In the annals of jazz, Duke Ellington stands like a lone figure etched against a forlorn sky, his legacy a testament to the endurance and artistry that shaped his orchestra like the hand of a sculptor upon wet clay. His touch upon the piano keys whispers soft like the wind through the pines, yet as a composer, he weaves tapestries rich and complex, each thread a testament to the talent within his band. He built cathedrals of sound where the soloist roams free, yet he penned with precision, calling upon the unique voices of his players to illuminate the dark corners of his compositions. In this, he crafted a sound that was both singular and vast, a sound where each piece fit into a grand mosaic of innovation and brilliance.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington's sound, a sound like no other, citing Creole Love Call, where the voice is wielded as a jazz instrument, a texture and color unburdened by words. This early work stands as a testament to his ability to compliment and elevate the soloist's style, a thread woven throughout his career. It moves slow, deliberate, a twelve bar blues with six choruses:\n\nFirst, a call and response, voice and reeds, the voice smooth as river stones, then rough as the crags of a mountain.\nNext, the muted trumpet sings, stretching the melody with blue notes that hang like twilight.\nThen, a clarinet soars high, the piano beneath it a subtle dance.\nThe full band echoes, brass and reeds answering each other in echoes of the first.\nThe fifth chorus rises, reeds calling high, syncopated brass and rhythm beneath.\nAnd finally, the voice and reeds return, the growl technique transforming the voice into an instrument itself.\n\nEllington's use of voice, a brushstroke of tone color, is a thread that runs through the tapestry of his work. In Hot and Bothered, a year hence, his orchestration is tight, his ear for tone color sharp. There, “Bubber” Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing engage in a call and response as rich as the earth, creating a sound that is both vocal and instrumental. And in It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), these ideas find further expression, as Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody, a cornerstone in the architecture of Ellington's orchestra.",
            "In the slow and relentless march of time, creatures shift and change, molded by forces both seen and unseen. One might wonder why these beings twist and turn upon their path of evolution, what barriers or guides might steer them along their course. The old wisdom of D’Arcy Thompson from the year nineteen and seventeen still whispers its quiet truth, that the heart of nature's forms eludes the grasp of numbers, an enigma yet unsolved. But the age has advanced, and in its wake, men have begun to use the language of mathematics to probe the secrets of the mollusk’s curving shell, through the journey of its life and the long tale of its kind (as pondered by Raup and Stanley in the year nineteen and eighty-one). With this study, we seek to weave together the strands of mathematical modeling and the tangible world of experiment, to uncover the hidden gears and levers that drive the evolution of the Prunum's form.\n\nIn this task, we took to the shadows cast by X-rays upon the shells of Prunum, seeking the lines and curves that tell their story. These we fed to the machine, the one they call CerioShell, born of Stone in nineteen and ninety-five, and from its calculations arose visions of shells that might be, to trace the limits of their potential change. These findings, in concert with the raw observations of nature, aim to cast light upon the great turning of macroevolution in this lineage.\n\nImagine a shell as a passage spiraling through the ages, each turn a whorl upon an unseen axis, the columella its spine. The whorls grow with a mind of their own, and a line, the suture, marks their boundaries. The greatest of these whorls is the last, the body whorl, while the spire rises above, its apex pointing to the heavens, and the base grounding it below. Out of this creation, the creature ventures forth through the aperture, its gateway to the world.\n\nIn viewing these shells, one might gaze from the apex, the base, the aperture, or the opposite side. And to count the whorls, one must see from above, finding the first suture and drawing a line to divide the shell, to reckon each turn from that mark, even to the quarter of a whorl.\n\nConsider the shell as a series of open doors, each a moment in time, as the creature builds its home. The path of the aperture can be traced by the coordinates of its journey, the radius both wide and tall. This trajectory, a story woven in numbers, can be altered by shifting the variables, thus changing the blueprint of the mollusk's creation.",
            "In the sprawling archipelago of Indonesia, the measure of life’s fragile beginnings has stood unmoved these past ten years, a stillness that echoes in the halls of hospitals and the quietude of rural clinics. While the nation strides toward the Millennium’s beckoning goals, meeting the calls for clean water and the sanctity of sanitation, the cries of mothers and the breath of infants tell a different tale. The path to the promised land of health for child and mother remains fraught, the goals set for 2015 a distant mirage. The reasons for this failure lie buried in the bones of a weakened system, a system in need of fortification rather than mere programmatic patchwork.\n\nIn the crowded rooms where life begins, there is now a greater presence of skilled hands, yet the promise is hollow. Seventy-two percent of births boast such attendance, but the skill is oft possessed by those whose hands are bound by tradition, midwives who cannot wield the tools of intervention when the blood flows too freely. The shadow of maternal death looms large, the specter of hemorrhage ever-present. And so the numbers that speak of progress are but whispers in the wind, masking the vast expanse of work yet undone. Meanwhile, the children suffer, their small bodies wracked with illness, and the hands of health professionals grow scarce in the treatment of their fevered sickness. The records of care after birth are fragmented and incomplete, yet they tell enough of a story—a narrative of neglect that spans the nation.\n\nIn the matter of Cesarean births, the statistics are telling, the figures languishing at a meager four percent, a testament to the inequities that divide this land. In the cities, the rate climbs to seven, yet in the remote corners, it falls to two. The disparity in service is a chasm carved by geography and wealth, the cities drawing the lion's share of care while the rural lands are left wanting. And within this division lies another tale of inequity, the chasm between rich and poor, a gap of twenty-seven percent in the use of services. The poor, ever at the margins, find themselves adrift in a sea of costs beyond their means.\n\nAs the nation contemplates its course, the question looms large: how best to mend this fabric of care? Should the focus be sharp and singular, a programmatic spear aimed at the heart of the issue, or should the strengthening of the system be broad and deep, encompassing the full breadth of life’s journey from womb to world? The allure of targeted programs is strong, their objectives clear and results swift. But the siren song comes with a price. To pour resources into one vein of the health sector is to starve another, to draw the lifeblood of human talent to where the money flows quickest, leaving other fields barren. The specter of international funding for HIV/AIDS casts a long shadow over family planning, a lesson in the perils of such a path. And so too, the proliferation of parallel programs breeds a forest of forms and a tangle of red tape, a bureaucracy that serves itself more than those it was meant to aid.",
            "The annals of Popular Music stretch long in the shadows of time, a century's worth of sound and fury that resists confinement in neat little boxes. These sounds, unruly as a wild river, branch into countless tributaries—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and beyond—each spawning a profusion of sub-genres, sub-sub-genres, a tangled web of sonic exploration. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal has, over the past four decades, become a realm of manifold voices. Its expression is raw and unyielding, a tapestry woven from the darker threads of human emotion. This diversity, birthed from the genre's inception, revealed a flexibility that musicians seized upon, crafting sub-genres and further still until the music became a labyrinth of its own making. \n\nAnd now, as we stand amidst the cacophony of heavy metal's evolution, the essence of what defines it seems to blur, absorbed as it is with themes borrowed from other realms of music. Its roots, however, remain, for understanding the sprawling edifice of metal today demands a reckoning with its origins, its nature as a movement transcending mere genre.\n\nMetal is a journey through shadow, a pursuit of the infinite. It is a sound of excess—more bass, more volume, more violence, more spectacle. It is less the primitive beat, more the virtuoso's touch; the musicians are craftsmen, their mastery evident in every note. Metal, unsurprisingly, is a journey often fueled by the mind-altering haze of drugs. In the mid-seventies, a psychedelic tide swept minds to the brink, birthing records that spoke in tongues of madness and otherworldly visions. These qualities, visceral and dark, struck a new chord in the music scene, a scene where much of what was popular dared not tread into such shadowed realms. Successive waves of metal drew from these dark waters, echoing the Romantic Era’s penchant for the visceral and sublime. The darkness runs like a black thread through the lyrics, a staple of the movement, a whisper of the abyss.\n\nConsider, if you will, the song Helter Skelter, the Beatles' own foray into the depths. It is a song that ascends and descends, a reflection of the mind's tumultuous journey under the influence. Some whisper it to be among the first born of Heavy Metal, a response to the Rolling Stones’ own darkened tune. The Beatles, in their rivalry, sought to prove they could summon the heaviness of the Stones, casting this track into the world from the depths of The White Album.",
            "In the years before the surrealists set their dreams to canvas, Henri Rousseau crafted his own visions from the fabric of his soul. The Dream, painted in 1910, stands as a testament not merely to the wonder of lands traversed in dreams but to the yearnings and aspirations that stirred within Rousseau's heart. Here is a woman cast in awe, and here too lies Rousseau, a painter longing for the embrace of recognition and the praise of his peers. From the outset, he was beset by the vexing choice: to mimic the styles that would grant him entry into the hallowed halls of the art world or to forge his own path, unshackled and defiant.\n\nTo lay eyes upon The Dream, one must first know the dreamer himself. Born May 21, 1844, in the shadowed town of Laval in the northwest of France, Rousseau's beginnings were humble. His father, a tinsmith by trade, lived a life of modest means. Rousseau's hands knew no art in his youth, only the labor of a gabelou, a toiler of municipal tolls, though the world knew him falsely as a douanier. In his personal life, tragedy was a constant companion. The death of his wife Clémence, preceded by the loss of eight children, left him with only a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief. With brush and canvas, Rousseau sought solace, a new dawn in the midst of despair. Unlike his contemporaries who painted the peasantry with romance, Rousseau was of the folk, a dreamer of dreams that echoed the common man's heart.\n\nTo yearn for acceptance is a human thing, and given his journey, Rousseau's fervent desire to be embraced by the art world is understandable. Untrained, commencing his true calling late, he labored in the shadow of giants. Recognition came slowly, only as Matisse was carving his own niche. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of the two as rivals yet not, their purposes diverging. Matisse, a man driven by the fear of banality, while Rousseau's wish was to paint with such convention that he might be welcomed into the Artiste Français. Yet in that desire lay the paradox of his existence.",
            "In the quiet corridors of thought where the world’s thinkers have often wandered, there lies a tether binding ethics to aesthetics, truth to beauty. At the core of it all, there is a reason, something elemental. Keats, with his Grecian urn, whispers to us that beauty is truth and truth beauty. That alone is the knowing granted to us in this world. Our journey through life imparts knowledge through the rigors of education or the trials of experience, yet there are things deeper still, understood without instruction. Ethics and aesthetics, you see, are less commandments than they are whispers of understanding. Our exploration of morality and art seeks not to lay down laws but to uncover the mysteries of what makes art resonate or an action noble.\n\nIn the telling of art’s worth or moral’s measure, the conversation dances around but never quite holds the essence in its grasp. Take da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, a subject of myriad discussions—foreground, background, contrast, and culture. Yet none capture why it stands as art. When asked of a beloved piece, a soul might say, “There’s just something about it,” before delving into critique. Art and morality resist reduction to mere qualities. As O’Connor wisely notes, a story unveils what mere statements cannot. All descriptions of literature leave something transcendent. Ethics, too, shares this nature. Wittgenstein muses that ethics cannot be spoken, for it transcends. It is this ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, that is the true strength of art and morality, forging the link between them.\n\nMorality and art wend their way to us in the realm of the noumenal, as Kant might term it. They touch us in ways that defy full explanation. Literature, especially, bears this bond with the moral. As McKean observes, literature’s distinction lies in its moral quality. Other arts might escape such standards, but literature’s very essence is intertwined with the values of life. Living is entwined with values, and literature matters because it reflects those very values back to us.",
            "In the land of Germany as it stands now, a robust and unified presence lingers. From the shadowed embrace of the Alps in München to the northern reach of Kiel by the Baltic Sea, the cultural tapestry weaves its way through the country. It is felt along the banks of the Rhine in Köln, threading its path to Dresden where the Elbe flows. To see Germany's culture as a singular entity is to overlook the myriad threads that form its history, echoing from tribes long past.\n\nGermania, the cradle of the Germanic soul, holds a name whose roots are tangled in scholarly debate. Tacitus, in his accounts, spoke of the Tungrians, a tribe he claimed once bore the name German before they ventured across the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. It was Julius Caesar who first inscribed “Germanus” in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, a term lifted from the Gauls to set apart those he had vanquished from those who stood unconquered, the latter crossing the Rhine with a mischievous intent. Some, in their conjectures, propose it was a Gaulish word for a neighbor, while others see it as tied to the Germanic spear, the ger, or the Old Irish garim, a shout that marked the Germans as loud and fierce.\n\nTacitus, in his stoic prose, penned “De Origine et situ Germanorum” in AD 98, speaking of a people aboriginal, untouched by the tides of migration. He mused that no man would forsake the fertile lands of Asia or Africa for the harsh terrain and sullen skies of Germania unless it was the call of home. For who in their right mind would leave Rome for such a place? Not the Romans, not then. They sent their armies to the edges of Germania, thirsting for its bounty, yet always they turned back to the sprawling heart of their empire. As the Germanic tribes took form in the first century, they lingered on the empire's periphery, trading and serving among the Roman ranks, their skills honed by the land they called home (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the shroud of disguise wends its way through the soul’s corridors, a tool both cunning and perilous. This masquerade, crafted to deceive, must ultimately be cast off, lest the wearer be consumed by its shadow, leaving only echoes of identity behind. The unraveling of deception bears its own burden—alienation, a severing of bonds once held dear. Thus, one stands at a crossroads, the heart torn between the sanctity of self and the fragile tapestry of human connection. For while some may look upon the ruse with indifference, others shall find offense in the unmasking, their trust shattered like glass upon the stones.\n\nThe intricate dance of deception twines with the reversal of gender roles, raising questions that linger like specters in the mind's recesses. Chief among them is the bewildering query: why? What compels one to forsake their own visage and don the garb of another gender? Viola's plight answers with the voice of survival: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). In lands unknown, Viola cloaks herself in masculinity to stave off danger, her guise a shield against the world’s brute forces. Yet this guise estranges her from the womenfolk, severing her from their solace and strength. Her deception, so artfully wrought, ensnares Olivia in a web of confusion, blurring the lines between Cesario and Sebastian, leading to a love misplaced: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). And still, she carries the weight of unspoken ardor, a flame flickering between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nIn this tangled skein, Twelfth Night speaks to the modern soul, revealing how deceit may unlock the heart’s hidden chambers, drawing forth desires long buried. The shadows of Olivia and Orsino’s hearts suggest yearnings unspoken, desires unbidden, brought to light by Viola’s masquerade. Does Olivia’s heart lean toward Cesario for the semblance of manhood, or does it whisper of a deeper truth, a love for women that dares not speak its name? Yet, it seems more likely that Olivia mirrors the follies of her time, where judgment clings to the surface, to the fleeting beauty of countenance. Her swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, her embrace of Cesario/Viola as kin rather than lover, sings of this transformation: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "The German colonial dominion, a vast and unruly beast, was remarked upon by many for its cruelty, most vividly in the blood-drenched lands of German South West Africa where the Ovaherero and Nama peoples met their grim fate. Yet an empire so sprawling as this cannot be easily reckoned with a single tale of savagery. It was a tapestry of many colors, each colony a world unto its own with laws and manners as diverse as the lands they governed. In the realm of education too was such variance. When the British laid claim to German East Africa, known as Tanganyika, in the year 1919, they encountered a multitude of Africans not only schooled but literate. The Germans had sown seeds of learning across their holdings in Kamerun and beyond, earning the admiration of those who chronicled such endeavors.\n\nYet in the arid expanse of South West Africa, what they now call Namibia, the story was a different one. There, unlike in the green expanses of East Africa where the state had seen fit to build schools and take charge of educating the native populace, the burden fell almost entirely to missionaries, who struggled with scant aid from the government. It was the Europeans who received the state’s largess, with schools established for their benefit and missionary efforts therein strictly overseen and supported. The legacy of these policies lingered long after the Germans departed, leaving behind a land where the vast majority of its people remained untouched by the light of learning, their minds unawakened, their hands unlettered. The reasons for this divergence lay buried in the complex soil of social, political, and economic circumstance. This paper seeks to unearth these factors, guided by fresh inquiry into the hearts and minds of settlers and those who ruled them.\n\nThe annals of education under the German flag are rich, penned mostly in the mother tongue of those who sought to document the ways of teaching in lands far from home. These early works served to describe what was, laying bare the bones of the educational systems in the colonies. Later, voices speaking in English broadened the conversation, comparing the schools of different colonies and plumbing the depths of their particularities. They revealed a world of contrasts. Among these, Cohen’s study stands as a keystone, examining the schools of South West Africa and East Africa and unraveling the threads that set them apart. He points to the settlers of South West Africa, a people drawn to its mild climes amidst the desert's embrace, as a key to understanding the peculiarities of its schools.\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to the other lands held by Germany, offered a climate more forgiving, though much of it was swallowed by the barrenness of desert. The Europeans flocked to it, finding it more welcoming than other colonies. By 1913, the land bore witness to nearly 15,000 white souls, while East Africa, holding the next largest gathering of settlers, counted but 5,336.",
            "There was a time when the United States of America and the lands of Mexico were bound in a rivalry that stretched across the years like a shadow over the desert, a span of fifty-seven years from 1836 to 1893. It was a time marked by conflict, the high-water mark of which was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. Here the United States moved with force and took from Mexico the lands of Texas and what would become the American Southwest. Other confrontations followed, a simmering flame that would last until just before the Great War. These two nations were locked in a struggle, their differences rooted deep in matters of faith and custom, and in the clash of their material desires. \n\nBut this tale is not unique in the chronicles of nations. For those who share a border often find themselves at odds, their interests clashing like the meeting of two rivers. The United States and Mexico were no different from many such enduring rivalries that mark the history of neighboring lands. David M. Pletcher once spoke of the long shadows cast by these old American diplomatic problems, their roots tangled in the lands of Mexico and Cuba. These are the two that sit closest to the heart of the United States, while other brethren in Latin America have known times of peace and good relation.\n\nSo it was that religious discord drove a wedge between these two nations, a rift as old as the hills, and no stranger to the annals of human history. As Sally Frahm tells it, in those days past, Americans set themselves against the creeds of Catholicism and the rule of monarchy, just as in the later years they would stand against the specters of fascism and communism. This was a struggle of ideologies, not unlike the Cold War that would follow, yet rooted in the faith of the people, a legacy inherited from the distrust that lay between English and Spanish blood. A legacy that forged a barrier to peace between the United States and Mexico.\n\nIn the reckoning of Diehl and Goerts, there were seventeen disputes that marked the years of this rivalry. Most of them were born of territorial matters, of raids across borders and the lawlessness of the frontier. Bandits and outlaws ranged wild, a trouble that lingered until both nations brought forth their military might to tame the edges of their lands. Yet, as the years passed, the rivalry began to wane. Schmitt tells us it was because Mexico found itself in need of what the United States could offer, and the ambitions of America turned from the hunger for lands to the pursuit of economic influence in Mexico in the late days of the nineteenth century.",
            "Fifteen years past I found myself felled by an ailment unknown to me before. A sudden and unwelcome visitor that took hold and did not let go.\n\nI once wore the garb of a nurse. A choice born not from dreams but from necessity, a yearning for the security denied me in younger days. They said, you will always find work for the world is ever sick. And so the words echoed through the corridors of my youth. Though I longed to tread the paths of science or to wield the pen of a journalist, I chose the way of nursing.\n\nAnd there I stood at forty-six, alone and with little to my name, unable to labor. Still, the years have passed and I remain tethered to Social Security, owning nothing but the grit of survival. Each day is a trial, a siege upon my sense of safety and self-worth. Certainty is a ghost, yet one truth remains: I have endured these years only through the kindness of kin and the grace of friends. For when calamity comes, it strips away the facade of strength.\n\nLife is a series of emergencies, large and small. No promises are made and no preparation is ever enough for the burdens that may come. \n\nI see the cracks in the grand edifice of governance and understand the call for less reliance on it. But I would rather we turn to one another, learn again to trust and to aid, than to retreat into solitary fortresses of our own making.\n\nThe tales of old speak of rugged souls who carved this land, yet it was not solitary strength but shared compassion and resources that steadied them through the trials. Those who traversed the mountains in their caravans did not reach the ocean by solitude.\n\nSo yes, prepare. I do. A kit for disaster, supplies for wounds, tablets to cleanse water, and coverings for windows should the unthinkable arise. Flashlights and batteries, candles and matches sealed against the wet. Canned goods aplenty. If you have the means to till the earth and preserve its bounty, do so. A wood stove, too, if your home permits.\n\nBut as you gather these things, do not forget your neighbors.",
            "In the dim recesses of antiquity, sometime in the shadowy folds of the fifth or sixth century before the common era, there was a prince born into this world who would one day be known as the Buddha. His life was a journey away from princely pleasures, a path that led him to renounce the world and find a light within, a light that birthed a way of living that came to be known as Buddhism. Among the many branches that grew from this seed, Theravada stands as the most orthodox, a tradition that has seen the passage of twenty-five centuries and bears little resemblance to what the Buddha may have known. In distant lands like Sri Lanka, this change is visible in rituals such as the water-cutting ceremony, a practice untouched by the Buddha's teachings yet imbued with sacred meaning. The transformations, they run deep, from the surface of tradition to the very core of salvation. The Theravada community, both the robed and the unrobed, has bent and swayed to the winds of time, shaped by forces that are both of this world and outside it, forces both kind and cruel.\n\nTo trace these shifts, one must reckon with the terms of discourse. Internal and external, these are the markers of origin, the former arising from within the fold of the Buddhasasana, be they monk or layman, and the latter from those outside its sanctuary. Hostile forces, they bear the weight of scornful eyes, while benign forces drift indifferent, bringing change unbidden. These words will loop and twine through the telling.\n\nLet us turn to the heart of the matter, the doctrines that pulse at the center of Theravada Buddhism. The faithful find their refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a corpus of teachings known as the Tripitaka, unfolds in three: the Sutta Pitaka with its sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka with its rules for the monastic life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka with its deeper metaphysical musings. Metaphysical notions like Anatta, the absence of self, Dukkha, the ever-present suffering, and Anicca, the impermanence that colors all things. Only by seeing these truths can one step off the wheel of Sansara, the endless cycle of birth and death. Enlightenment brings an end to the trio of lobha, dosa, and moha—desire, hatred, and delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the precepts for living: five for the laity, many more for the monks. At the heart lies the teaching of the four noble truths: life is suffering, suffering springs from attachment, and suffering can be transcended."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the quiet chambers where men gather to negotiate, culture looms like a shadow cast by a great and ancient mountain. It is not a singular entity, nor is it a monolith of understanding. Culture is as much defined by its absences as by its presence, a tapestry of what it signifies and what it does not. It is a mistake to suppose it homogenous or singular, for it is neither. To say all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese accommodating is to speak in the broadest of tongues, to simplify beyond recognition. A wiser path for the negotiator is to grasp the weight and shape of culture in the matter at hand, to see how its unseen hand might guide the course of talk and barter. When a man walks among foreign customs, he sees them through the lens of his own, and comparisons bloom like wildflowers in the desert.\n\nTo grasp the heart of another culture is a journey that might begin with its history or its prejudices laid bare. It is not for one to judge or to change what has been wrought by time and tide, but to accept and navigate its bounds, especially when one's own bargaining strength is but a whisper. In foreign lands, respect for the old ways and beliefs is a bridge over chasms unseen, smoothing the path of discourse.\n\nYet culture is not merely confined to the borders of nations. Within a single land, companies craft their own ethos, their own corporate spirit. Some laude the long hours that stretch into the night, others a more measured pace. The essence of these cultures is woven into the fabric of the employee's garb, the cadence of their speech, the delegation of tasks. Some encourage giving to the world’s needs, others hold tight to approved causes. The American corporate landscape is as varied as the land itself, a mosaic of thought and practice.\n\nThe values that underpin a culture are the keys to its soul. If honor and harmony are cherished, a man will not shame his kin before the gathered eyes in pursuit of victory. If the hard bargain is held aloft, he will not rush to close the deal at first light. These truths must be held close as one approaches the table, yet to know the man across from you, to see him as more than an emblem of his world, this is the heart of true negotiation.",
            "The fool says in his heart, There is no God. These words echo first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and find repeated life in the opening of St. Anselm’s discourse on the divine. This notion, this reaching toward the divine, is shared by another mind, Thomas Aquinas. Both men, their thoughts twined around the existence of God, stand before us. Our task is to weigh their claims, to decide whose argument bears the greater truth. Let us assume, for brevity’s sake, that both agree on the God of the Bible. Any deviation from this figure would render the comparison of their defenses moot, as they argue for one singular vision of the divine. Yet I would contend that neither crafts a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo draw this out, we first turn our gaze upon St. Anselm. His words speak of understanding through faith, a journey into oneself to find the mark of God. He asserts that because God dwells within our understanding, we cannot truly imagine a world without Him. Though his language may stumble into the tedious and the obscure, the core remains: God’s proof lies within the mind’s own recesses. Anselm suggests that truth about God is not a foreign thing but is instead rooted in what we know to be true within. No external evidence is demanded. This notion of embracing what cannot be proven by the empirical is often called faith within Christian speak.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, walks a different path. He believes God’s existence can be proven through reason and evidence, leaving faith aside. Such a stance could serve the call of evangelism, a cornerstone of Christianity, by allowing conversions swayed by pure logic, untouched by the need for blind belief. Aquinas presents five logical roads to God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he argues that God’s proof is a logical necessity. Just as one knows the missing piece of a puzzle by the pieces that remain, so too does logic dictate the presence of the divine.",
            "In the craft of storytelling, authors wield their prose like a blade, carving out feelings and attitudes that resonate deep within the reader. Some forge their words with greater deftness than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his opus The Great Gatsby, employs a multitude of such techniques. He pairs adjectives and nouns in unexpected unions, weaving an aura that clings to the narrative like mist. At times, he imbues symbols with meaning, using them as vessels to carry the weight of emotion and thought. Such is his method with colors—gold, green, white, gray, red, pink—all pigments stained with purpose.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald paints his world with hues of white and gray, each brushstroke deliberate, each shade steeped in significance. White, a facade of elegance and class; gray, the pallor of age and decay. From the outset, these colors drape the scenes, omnipresent. Daisy and Jordan, ever clad in white, float through the pages like specters in a dream. Nick dons white flannels to Gatsby's gathering, Tom sports a white shirt in Myrtle’s company, and Catherine is powdered in milky white. The rare absence of white comes when Nick surveys the garish kaleidoscope of Gatsby's revelry.\n\nFitzgerald casts these colors over the mundane and the unremarkable. Nick descends through the alabaster canyons of lower New York, guests at Gatsby’s soirées are nothing but gray names on a ledger, Catherine's abode is a mere slice of a long white cake, a testament to anonymity. The world is populated by white girlhoods and gray lands, gray cars and gray men, all swallowed by the ashes of their own insignificance.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has woven enough meaning into white and gray, he turns them upon his subjects, marking them with insignificance. Daisy, after a long absence of these shades, emerges cloaked in white, driving a little white roadster, a figure rendered uniform by desire rather than substance, an object of Gatsby's unyielding longing. As she moves through the narrative, the gray haze of her fur collar and the white of her gown become emblems of a life lived on the periphery, a mere echo of uniformity amidst the chaos of dreams.",
            "In the sun-drenched expanse of San Diego County, where the earth yields its bounty beneath a mild and constant sky, the land is a testament to the fecundity of creation. Here the fields are sown with tomatoes and citrus and the tender greens of leafy vegetation. Squash and broccoli flourish under the watchful sun, while herbs and tree fruits—peaches and lemons—hang heavy on bending branches. Berries ripen, honey glistens in the comb, and peppers burn with the promise of heat. Such is the wealth of this land, where organic community supported agriculture finds fertile ground and the demand outpaces the supply, with waiting lists that stretch long and hopeful. The eggs and milk from these farms are coveted, the hens and cows raised in the manner of the old ways. The land itself opens to those who seek it, offering tours and trails for those who would wander among the rows, and birds, too, find sanctuary in this place.\n\nThe endeavor of organic farming, though, is not without its burdens. It bears an economy of its own, costly in labor and time, for the farmer must walk the fields to pluck weeds by hand and send pests fleeing without the aid of poison. The soil must be nurtured with care, and the losses, they say, can be greater than the gains, for the scale of a small farm cannot match the great industrial sprawl. Yet in this toil there is also the hope of greater life, for the absence of chemicals brings a richness to both plant and creature, a diversity that speaks to the soul. To manage this land is to dance with the seasons, to plant cover crops and rotate the grazing, to root out the invaders and shape the growth to create a tapestry of habitat.\n\nThe land in question lies near the town of Potrero, a stretch of 160 acres where chaparral and Mediterranean grasses mingle with the oaks, a place bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This is the East County Southern Foothills, a part of the great San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, still under scrutiny, considers the fate of over one hundred species, among them the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. The butterflies and the California gnatcatcher find a tenuous home here, and the burrowing owl watches with eyes that hold the wisdom of decline.\n\nOnce, this land was home to the Native Americans, their presence woven into the very fabric of the earth. Cattle ranchers came in the 1800s, and the land was parceled for grazing and the cutting of wood. Now, in seeking the future, I turned to the records, searching for government aid and knowledge, pondering what a small farmer might do to balance the scales of cost and conservation. In this quest, I found an organic farm, a model of what might be, standing resilient in the same blessed region.",
            "There is a tether between brothers that is not easily severed, a bond forged in the crucible of shared blood and shared experience that cannot be undone. Within it lies a tumult of emotions, love and pride and jealousy and cruelty, vying for space in a heart too small to contain them all. Brothers know each other in ways that no other can, seeing in the other a reflection of themselves. It is when the world bears down with all its weight that this bond reveals its true nature, whether it be light or dark. The cost of clarity is steep, for to understand these emotions is to reckon with their consequences. To look into a brother's eyes and see oneself is to see not the visage the world perceives but the unvarnished truth of one's own soul. It is in the deeds done and the aftermath they leave behind that a man's true character is etched.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this path, their hearts a battleground of emotions as they traverse a landscape that is lush and unforgiving. They embark on a journey doomed to failure, where bitter disappointment and fierce pride clash in a moment that leaves only one brother standing. This theme unfurls through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and the interplay between him and his brother, narrated in a voice heavy with the weight of complex feelings and a world perceived through the narrow lens of youth.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by one emotion above all: pride. From the first venture with his frail brother, Doodle, to their final, ill-fated journey, resentment festers in his heart. He had envisioned a brother to whom he could impart the secrets of the world, the art of holding breath, the thrill of running, the joy of climbing the vines that hung in Old Woman Swamp. A companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with him in the great pine's highest fork behind the barn. Yet Doodle, born with a heart weak as a moth's wing, could not fulfill these dreams. The young boy's fantasies were shattered, his dreams dashed in an instant.\n\nIn his anger, the thought of ending the small child's life flickered through his mind, a dark thread in the tapestry of his thoughts. What child, in the innocence of youth, harbors such grim thoughts? And yet, when Doodle smiled at him, the darkness receded. That simple act kindled hope in his heart, revealing that the desire to harm was but a shadow, insubstantial against the deep-rooted love he held for his brother. It was instinctive, a bond unbreakable despite the tumult within.",
            "The human mind is a labyrinthine creation, a web of thought and memory, a vessel of mystery. In ages past, as man rose from the dust and forged tools from stone, so did his understanding of the mind evolve from simple to profound. At first, it was likened to clay, then to parchment, then to the written page, and now to the machine of silicon and light. Yet, let not these comparisons deceive, for they are but shadows on the wall, prone to lead astray.\n\nIn the beginning, there is the world. The senses stand as sentinels at the gate, transforming the raw and the real—touch, heat, the echo of sound, the dance of light—into the language of the mind, a dialogue of electricity and chemistry. This information, thus transformed, journeys through the labyrinth, guided by the unseen hand of the brain’s own making. It rises from the ground up, building from the base elements of color and line, the boundaries where one thing ends and another begins, to form the whole. And yet, from above, from the heights of knowing, the mind descends to meet it, shaping understanding with what it has learned before, until one sees not just a box of black upon white, but knows it for what it is.\n\nAttention, that fickle arbiter, stands watchful, determining what shall pass and what shall fade into the backdrop of the mind’s eye. A thousand blades of grass may sway beneath one’s gaze, yet the mind chooses to see but the ground beneath the feet. And yet, in the clamor of voices, it plucks a name from the air, sharp and clear. Through this dance of perception, the mind moves, ever refining, ever deciding.\n\nFor the mind to weave its intricate patterns, it must first gather and store the threads of thought. Memory is its loom, with many chambers—sensory, immediate, enduring. It begins with the act of encoding, a translation into forms that the mind may hold. Words may be seen, heard, or known in essence, each pathway its own. Once captured, these threads of memory are held by the mind’s unseen hands. In fleeting moments, they are recalled by an electric dance between neurons. In the depths of time, they rest in the architecture of life itself, woven into the fabric of being.\n\nAnd so, the mind constructs its knowledge, laying pathways that echo the steps of thought, some crafted by the mind’s own recall, others by the models of machine or the laws of nature. Concepts link one to another, a tapestry of meaning—“chair” to “table,” “table” to “wooden,” each connected by the invisible threads of understanding.",
            "In the year 2007, the United States of America found itself mired in a financial tempest that swept the land with an unforgiving hand. Unemployment rose like a specter in the night, the housing market crumbled into dust, and the great monoliths of American enterprise lay shattered in their own ruin. This recession, a specter that haunts the present, demands that we ask: what conspired to bring about this calamity, and what must be done to stave off such dark tides? In the starkest of terms, the crisis was birthed from the loins of selfish and myopic political maneuverings that coerced banks and enterprises to cast sub-prime loans into an already faltering and unsteady financial edifice. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not free from the yoke, forced to underwrite and reforge these mortgages into constructs of collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. When the borrowers faltered under the weight of their debts, the banks, bereft of capital reserves, transferred this chaos onto the repackaged mortgages they had pawned off, cascading the turmoil through the sinews of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this financial maelstrom can be traced back to the twilight of the millennium, in 1999, during the Clinton era. The President, in his quest for a second tenure, sought to bolster his standing among the populace. In pursuit of this aim, the Clinton administration unshackled lending restrictions, setting the stage for the impending sub-prime debacle that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times bore witness to these machinations in 1999, chronicling that Fannie Mae, the nation's foremost underwriter of home mortgages, was under mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to extend mortgage loans to those of lesser means, all while appeasing shareholders with promises of ever-growing profits. Holmes, with a prophet's foresight, discerned the harbinger of doom: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" And as the introduction has laid bare, and as Holmes foretold, reckless lending was to be the harbinger of the economy's unraveling.\n\nA confluence of forces converged to hurl the economy into chaos, not least of which was the novel and intricate design of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations were wielded with reckless abandon in the years preceding the crisis, serving only to bind more threads of the economy to the fate of the housing market. This left American households, and the financial markets writ large, overextended and perilously susceptible to even the minutest tremors in home prices.\n\nInevitably, the housing bubble burst, and the financial strongholds that had embraced these mortgage-backed securities found themselves betrayed. The five titans of U.S. investment banks collectively bore $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts by 2007, a sum that comprised nearly a third of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were relinquished for a pittance, Lehman Brothers disintegrated into the void, and Goldman Sachs along with Morgan Stanley were compelled to transform into commercial banks, shackled by stringent regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened under $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were subsumed under government control by September of 2008.",
            "Exposition. That stretch of narrative where a writer unfurls their wings, casting spells of prose to captivate or to lull into the gentle embrace of oblivion. A place where the audience may drift to sleep or retreat from the story's embrace with curses upon their lips. Dr. Merlin, in her encounters with an excess of information, has been known to rail at her screen, bereft of the fun such indulgence might offer.\n\nExposition is a shadow that trails your every move.\n\nThose who read with care know the old adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in the webs of narration where nothing stirs, or where chaos reigns unchecked. Exposition is the whispering imp on your shoulder, urging you to lay bare the past so the tale may find its path, not to be mistaken for the other imp, which entices you to unfurl the entirety of a character's youth.\n\nExposition is the recounting of the past, often in stark prose. In the realm of film, it unfurls when one soul shares with another a torrent of knowledge akin to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In the written word, it is the author's voice that weaves this tapestry.\n\nConsider this: as you traverse a tale, you learn of a heroine who met her love in a time and place, of their grand union, and of the grim fate that befell her husband before her eyes. You would not foresee such a profound story to be confined to mere pages where their voices are but whispers in the wind. You would seek the depth of the husband's soul, revealed in his words and deeds, to understand the breadth of his love for her. Equally, the heroine's heart would be laid bare, her life enriched by his presence, and you would desire the author to paint her journey with vivid strokes, to feel the weight of her loss, drawing you deeper into her world.\n\nYou yearn for substance upon the bare bones of the tale: \"They met, they wed, he perished.\"\n\nAs a storyteller, you must provide that substance. (*glances at metaphor, resigns, presses on*) There is a pull to hasten through certain passages. Perhaps you introduce a new figure, a former Air Force man, now the night guardian of a gas station, twice wed with no offspring, who spends his weekends casting lines into waters, dreaming of owning the very place he tends, and who savored Eggs Benedict at dawn.",
            "I watched the broadcasts come flickering from Columbus, Ohio, and the first of them from NBC 4 on a morning that seemed reluctant to dawn, August 13, 2011. The lead story spun a dark tale from Ashley, Ohio, where a man by the name of Shad Hostettler had taken a knife to his wife, though her name remained wrapped in silence. His visage appeared on the screen, and in his eyes, there was something of the devil's own making. The story, raw and bleeding, was given but two minutes' breath, the scant details laid bare: multiple stabbings, arrest made. A fitting brevity, I reckoned.\n\nNext came the lament of a young man, Travis Buyers, all of eighteen years, felled by gunfire in the shadows of Sharon Woods. Critically injured and no hand of justice yet laid upon a suspect. The SWAT team prowled the scene, but the tale was cut short—perhaps, I thought, because he was from a neighborhood where skin was darker and voices oft unheard. I've long seen how the media's gaze skims lightly over the tragedies of minorities, while the plight of a missing or harmed white child or adult sends them into frenzied cries.\n\nThen came word of a gunshot wound in a Med-Flight helicopter, the bullet's path traced to a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers dangled a five-thousand dollar reward like bait to catch the shadowed shooter.\n\nThe weather turned the narrative next, with rain and thunderstorms looming in the Saturday sky, temperatures to hover in the eighties. The forecast was a mere whisper, a siren call to keep eyes glued to the screen.\n\nA robbery followed, from a UDF on Clime Road, a dark-skinned man in a hoodie casting his shadow over the store. Six feet tall, a lean one hundred and fifty pounds, they said, the color of his skin given undue weight in the telling, like a stone in a small child's pocket.\n\nLastly, the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin, convicted in the trade of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. They spoke of his sentence not in years but in months, three hundred of them, a curious twist perhaps meant to sharpen the sting. Hispanic, they called him, a detail that seemed to bear no real weight in the matter.",
            "In the vast expanse of the financial wilderness, where numbers sway like the tall grass in the prairie, there exists a curious thing known as an ETF, an exchange traded fund. This peculiar entity shadows an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund, yet it bears the markings of flexibility, trading in the open like a lone stock on the plains. The ETF offers the breadth of an index fund combined with the singularity of stock ownership. It allows a man to sell short, to buy on margin, to claim even a single share, and all this with the expense ratios that lay lower than the average mutual fund, like the sun sinking beneath the horizon.\n\nYet, not without its drawbacks, for in this land of promise a commission must be paid on any trade, as if one bartered for cattle or land. The bounty of ETFs lies in their vast variety, and while these benefits shine like the morning sun, the prudent investor must question their existence and measure their reach. Thus, the task falls upon us to examine the ETF known as IHF, to weigh it against the ten mighty holdings that form its backbone, and to discern if the singular ETF stands as tall as a diversified portfolio of those ten stocks. We seek to know if these holdings could be arranged in a manner more advantageous, yielding a sharper ratio or better return.\n\nAmidst this endeavor, we select only the top ten holdings, those that account for 63.58% of the ETF's wealth, for to include all would be a burden too great. These ten hold a tale of their own, each with a percentage of the assets they guard. To understand how these ten reflect the ETF IHF, we must use their current assets, normalized to a perfect hundred, to calculate their weight upon a portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio were constructed solely from these ten in accordance with the ETF's design. The chart of calculations lies before us, a testament to their worth.\n\nFrom this chart, it is clear as the mountain stream that a portfolio of the top ten rises with a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, a climb of 16% in returns. The Beta of these ten stands .12 lower than the ETF in its entirety. It seems a portfolio of these ten could offer greater return with less risk, but the winds of chance whisper that their means may not differ in truth. To measure this, we turn to the standard deviation of each stock, normalized to the perfect hundred, to compare their collective deviation against the ETF IHF's own.\n\nAnd so the journey continues, the numbers like the stars in the night sky, guiding us onward through the vast landscape of finance.",
            "When you look back upon Figure 17, you see how in the third month the number of commuter logs dropped like a stone in a well. It was a sight to make a man ponder on the ways of the world. Why it happened, no one could rightly say. Winter grips the New England campus, and with it comes the reluctance of folks to brave the cold on bicycle or foot, which might explain a portion of the fall. December is the time when the semester closes its weary eyes and students and faculty alike drown in the tides of final work and grades. The commuter log, once a priority, finds itself forgotten, adrift on a sea of pressing matters. Then the holidays come, sweeping all before them, and the campus grows silent with the absence of its people. Classes awaken again in the latter days of January, yet still February logs remain scarce, a mystery unsolved. Perhaps such projects burn bright at the start, only to wane as the novelty fades. To counter such decline, we set forth the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a call to arms that saw logs rise once more. The struggle to keep the project's heart beating was a lesson in overcoming the quiet pull of holiday and semester breaks in the academic world.\n\nAnother obstacle stood, as solid as the mountains, in the love people bear for their cars, the freedom and independence they represent. It's a love rooted deep in the soil of our culture, and to turn people from it requires more than mere words. We offered incentives, prizes to tempt them from their paths: gift certificates to local haunts, the promise of a meal or a warm drink, a massage or a book. But what if the prizes had been grander? A bicycle, a hybrid, or even an electric car? Such offerings might have sparked the interest anew, luring them back to the fold. The nature of the prizes remained constant, a steady note in the project’s song. Yet had we announced, come December, the chance of a bicycle, and in January the lure of a car, perhaps then the engagement would have grown rather than dwindled. It is a thought to stir the imagination, what might have been.",
            "In the dim corridors of the Library of Congress where the ghosts of early cinema whisper, I found myself drawn to the flickering shadows of Edison’s trick films. Fifteen of these spectral reels span the years 1895 to 1901, each one a conjuration of illusion wrought by the alchemy of early editing. My study was a meditation on the poetics of these celluloid phantasms and a dissection of the evolutionary aberrations that emerged in their latter days. At the dawn of the century, these films were as bound to their stages as a moth to the flame, their worlds contained within the rigid confines of a frontal proscenium. The camera, unyielding and static, captured long and medium shots with the fidelity of a solemn witness. Each film a singular breath, one shot, one film.\n\nYet, as the century turned, a few bold visions dared to fracture this orthodoxy, introducing the radical notion of multiple shots. Still, most adhered to the stage-bound artifice, the camera never straying from its steadfast post to follow the actors’ steps. This immobility, a vestige of theatre and vaudeville, shackled the figures to a lateral dance, side-to-side, never towards the lens. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right, tracing a path along the horizontal axis, the camera unmoving, a dispassionate observer as they vanish beyond the frame.\n\nThe proscenium's grip dictated the use of long shots, with medium shots a mere whisper and close-ups an unheard plea. The frames echoed the theatre's grandeur, where the audience's eye embraced the entirety of the spectacle, bounded by the stage’s borders. Actors remained in the midground tableau, close-ups forsaken in the dawn of film.\n\nThese early trick films bore the constraint of a single shot as their narrative vessel, a limitation that confined their length to a minute or less, dictated by the clockwork of frames per second. Their tales were brief and wondrous, vaudeville's magic acts captured with little narrative ambition. Yet, the illusion was a clever deceit, for what seemed a single shot was often a tapestry of many, woven together to conjure apparitions and vanishings. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), the illusion fractures under scrutiny, revealing the seam where Mary's spectral head is severed from her body. Though to the viewer's eye, it remains a singular, haunting vision.",
            "In the gatherings of shadowed halls and timeworn spires, the Gothic Novel stands as a contradiction of old and new, a literary oxymoron as Ian Watt notes in his chronicles of its ascent. This Gothic form, maligned and exalted in equal measure, has been accused of lacking depth even as it conjures the 'terrible sublime' that Burke would speak of in hushed tones. The birth of this literary specter traces back to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a conjuring of both ancient and modern romance to forge a new path through the world of letters. Walpole, with a craftsman’s eye, wove together the old theatrics and the mimicry of nature that the modern novel offered, and in this alchemy, he penned what he would call \"A Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic genre is a tapestry woven from the threads of medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even as The Castle of Otranto met the world, the word \"Gothic\" bore the weight of many meanings, stretching across peoples, styles, and ages. It seemed a relic, unsophisticated in the harsh gaze of modernity's march. Yet it was this very mingling of the theatrical and the novel's new form, with its gaze into the heart of its characters, that let the Gothic endure, ever ancient yet forever new to eyes far removed from its birth.\n\nAmong the shadows of Gothic thought, the specter of Chivalry walks, a relic of medieval honor and the knightly path. In The Castle of Otranto, this old chivalric code is both preserved and transformed. For Gothic scribes, the idea of chivalry held a sacred importance—it evoked the noble knight, steadfast and true, a stark contrast to the absence of such ideals they perceived around them. Through these chivalric echoes, the Gothic past became a canvas of idealization, a hint of Romanticism yet to come, an attempt to cast a light upon the present’s shadows. Walpole, amidst the turmoil of his times, despaired at the world’s trajectory. Engulfed by the political storm and its accusations, he may have pondered the loss of the Gothic era's moral compass within the hearts of his contemporaries. This musing finds a face in Frederic, a character hewn from the stone of chivalric tradition.\n\nFrederic's tale is told before his entry, painted in images of chivalry. A prince once, his life marked by suffering and tragedy, lost to the world by infidel hands. In Frederic, the gallant knight takes form, an image stretched to the edge of excess, heralding the Gothic penchant for the grandiose.",
            "In the dim recesses of industry, where the hum of machinery echoes like a distant thunder, there lies the intricate dance of supply chain management. It's a procession, from the moment a customer’s desire is whispered into the ether, through the raw, unformed materials, till the goods are birthed, handed over from one unseen hand to another, till they reach that final resting place in the consumer’s grasp. This notion, this orchestration of movement and time, was laid forth in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver, who envisioned the path of goods as a tapestry woven with intent, planning, and control, all to meet the whims of want in a manner swift and sure. Six pillars uphold this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and the ghostly strands of information that tie them all.\n\nThe forge of production sits at the heart of this process, the molten core from which all else flows. It is here that the when and why and where and how are etched into the stone of intent. The managers, those stewards of commerce, peer into the market, that roiling sea of demand, to glean the desires of the masses. They chart their course, deciding what shall be made and in what measure, choosing the ground where these things shall spring into being, ever mindful of the twin gods of volume and quality, and the needful satisfaction of those who await. And once the place is set, the gears of scheduling turn, the machines are tended, for in the minutiae lies the salvation or the downfall of the enterprise. Missteps here are costly, and the reckoning comes swift. In my own wanderings through the labyrinthine aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, I have seen the doctrine laid bare—a uniformity in attire, a precision in the reception of goods, a testament to the power of outlined processes to stave off the chaos that ever lurks at the edges.\n\nSupply, the second pillar, stands in the shadow of production, casting its own light upon the path. It is the art of choosing, of deciding which capabilities to cultivate within the walls of the facility and which to entrust to the hands of others. A single product may be born in many places, each division a cog in the greater machine, each with its own tools, its own people, its own craft. The manager’s eye must discern which piece fits where, or if the work shall be cast out to others, to partners in this grand endeavor. For in outsourcing lies the promise of velocity—the speed and grace to provide what is needed, when it is needed, without the burden of excessive cost. And so the dance continues, a delicate balance of power and trust, the symphony of supply chain management ever playing to the tune of demand.",
            "Victorian novels, with their ornate tapestries of detail and their unyielding gaze upon the aristocracy, chart a course through the history of an age. Yet from amidst this grand procession emerge two tales that wander from the well-trodden path: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels, with their enigmatic mysteries and the strange, bewildering turns of the bizarre, carve out a realm where characters are not merely drawn but etched deep, their motives and hearts laid bare under the scrutiny of shadows and dreams.\n\nAnd in that shadowed world, Oliver, beset by visions, walks again with the specters of Sikes and Crackit. Their quarrels echo in his mind, a relentless clamor, even as he finds himself speaking to them in the solitude of his thoughts. The sudden crack of gunfire seizes him, cries and shouts erupting as though the very night itself had awakened. Lights flash before his eyes, chaos surrounds him, and some unseen force sweeps him away. Through this tumult, there persists a constant ache, a torment that gnaws at him with an unyielding hunger.\n\nIn these novels, the dreams and visions serve as portals to inner truths, each one a revelation of the soul's hidden landscape. In Oliver Twist, the strange visions tear at the veil of the ordinary, exposing the raw nerves of Oliver's existence. As he relives the shooting in the depths of his mind, the scene unfolds with dreamlike clarity, a testament to his powerlessness against the forces that shape his fate. The hands that bear him away are unseen, the pain an ever-present specter, now entwined with fear rather than shrouded in the numbness of shock. The question looms large: whose design has wrought this suffering upon him? For it is not of his own making. This episode underscores the futility of Oliver's struggle for agency, even as his very life hangs by a thread. The specter of defeat hovers over him, as if old Fagin's shadow had begun to creep into his soul, urging him to surrender to despair, to abandon the fight. Yet somewhere within, a flicker remains, a quiet defiance that refuses to be entirely extinguished.\n\nThe day passed off—day! There was no day; it vanished as swiftly as it came—and night descended once more, a night endless in its dreadful hush, fleeting in its swift passage of hours.",
            "Years back, I found myself in the halls and classrooms of an after school refuge, a place where young minds, elementary and eager, came to wrestle with their lessons. My own inclinations lay in the labyrinth of language, English and the written word my favored realms. It was there that a teacher sought my aid for a boy named Adrian, a lad of perhaps eight or nine years, adrift in the sea of letters. His struggle, it seemed, was not with the words themselves but with the very symbols that made them. Some letters he grasped as if by instinct, others eluded him entirely, a dance of comprehension and confusion. He was Latino, of that there was no question, yet his English was flawless, untainted by any accent. We battled onward, he and I, until the day his mother darkened the doorway. I was watching over the few left behind, when she arrived, her speech a cascade of Spanish, a tongue I barely managed to navigate. But in those halting exchanges, the truth fell upon me with the weight of a revelation: Adrian's battle was with the alphabet itself, not the reading. Whether this epiphany served him well, I cannot say, but in my heart, I hope he found his way.\n\nI recount this tale to illuminate the chasm of language that looms in our schools, a chasm deepened here in the lands of California. It serves to remind that the barriers are not always where we expect them. A child may speak the language of his peers with ease yet find the page an insurmountable wall. This is a truth we must reckon with. So, what is to be done? In Adrian's case, the answer lay in the simple act of tutoring, a focus on the letters and their sounds. Yet for those whose tongues are not yet shaped by English, the path is fraught with complexity. There is no single remedy. The dual language system, the immersion, the tutors, the ESL classes, each a tool, none a cure by itself. The answer lies in their union.\n\nThe dual language path is a worthy venture, not merely for the children of Spanish tongues, but for all. Studies speak of children in bilingual programs surpassing their peers, an achievement not confined to the few. Fear lingers, a specter of wasted effort, a belief that most gain nothing. But this is a falsehood. Make these programs the standard, not the exception, and all will rise. Yet, how to achieve this? Must we demand our teachers speak in two tongues? No, such a demand is folly. But there is no reason we cannot bring forth a cadre of aides, tutors, call them what you will, who bridge this gap with their bilingual voices.",
            "From the first whispers of consciousness we are told of a force greater than ourselves, vast and unknowable. Some are led to chapels and others to synagogues, while others seek within the silence of their own hearts. We are handed down the faiths of our fathers and many accept them without question, yet there are those who turn away, dismissing the unseen in their self-centered world. In the course of our lives, we may embrace one creed and later cast it aside for another. We walk various paths, each seeking to understand our place in the cosmos through the lens of our own spiritual perceptions. In the shadows, we search for a light to guide us to the dawn.\n\nA cardinal, my father said when I inquired of his favored bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof above, sharing cigarettes. The water poured from the gutters, drowning the plants that clung to the edge of the porch. His eyes were fixed on the rain, lost in a gaze that seemed to see beyond the present. He had grown gaunt these past months, his clothes hanging loose as if they belonged to another man. His hair had thinned, a sparse memory of what once was. Still, he stared into the rain, never meeting my eyes. I felt the solitude between us, the fear of speaking the words that would make real what we both knew. I embraced him, then settled back, drawing my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the dim light of June’s end.\n\nHe left this world that December, five days past my twenty-second year. The poison and the fire of treatment had not lessened his pain, but only stretched his days beyond the doctors’ reckonings; what worth in such prolonged suffering I could not say. I questioned the nature of a God who would allow such cruelty. Alone in the darkness, I found no prayers left in me. If there was a God, I felt he had turned his ear from me long ago.\n\nI could not bear witness to his passing from this life. I chose not to. I wished to remember him in life, not in the shadow of death. I knew him, perhaps better than any, and knew he would not want me there in those final moments. So I lay curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the news that never came.\n\nNo one thought to call.",
            "In the rolling fields of Caroline where the soil lay dark and fertile, there stood a man named John Taylor, who with the fervor of a prophet, championed the cause of Republicanism. A farmer by trade, yet his voice echoed in the chambers of power, a testament to his fervent belief in the liberty of men and the restraint of government. His conviction in the agrarian way colored every word he spoke on sovereignty, on the sanctity of the Constitution, and even upon the courts of law.\n\nJohn Taylor saw in the young nation of the United States a canvas unspoiled, unblemished by the burdens of old traditions. Here was a land where men could craft with their own hands a government of self-rule. He held fast to the natural rights of man, these rights entwined like the roots of old trees, so that in denying one, the whole would wither. Such rights, he declared, must remain out of the grasp of any mortal government. In the brutish state of nature, it was the strong of arm and dark of mind who thrived, but within the bounds of civilization, such must not be.\n\nTo forge this society, Taylor said, the government must reckon with the dual nature of man, his capacity for both good and evil. His creed was simple, yet stern, that all virtues and vices of governance were but reflections of human nature. Good principles, he claimed, were those that safeguarded private land, nurtured the crops that sprang from it, and turned away from the lure of unchecked commerce. A government rooted in such principles would stand fair, despite the inevitable sway of those who lead with greed. Self-interest, he mused, drives all men, yet it turns foul when it births enclaves that flourish at the cost of others. A vigilant government was needed to keep man's darker instincts in check, ever wary of the creeping shadow of ill principles.\n\nAmong the chorus of Republican voices, Taylor's was steadfast, calling for a Constitution held tight to its written word. He envisioned a Federal government constrained, with powers no greater than those written clear upon the parchment. An expansive government meant an expensive one, and he saw in that the seeds of tyranny. Yet he warned against a mere literal reading of the text, for without the light of the framers' intent, corruption could easily take root. To Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true heart of the nation, a testament not to a singular entity, but to a union of sovereign states, each with its own soul.",
            "The world lay still before me, a tableau untouched by time, and I gazed upon it with a mind as unyielding and indifferent as the earth itself. No tether to abstraction disturbed my view, no whisper of understanding, for mine was a study of the visible and nothing beyond. Thoughts drifted like ghosts, ephemeral and unclaimed, the mind a smooth stone upon which the stream of perception flowed, untroubled and clear.\n\nOnce, at the urging of an artist I’d known, I procured a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I’d longed to draw since boyhood, six years tender and yearning for the secrets held in a pencil's line. The book promised to reveal all, from the mystery of graphite to the alchemy of perception. It taught, among other things, the framing of a picture, to distill chaos into clarity—a bowl of fruit on a table, a universe contained within a frame.\n\nYet there, before the bowl, I stood unable to conjure such a frame. Overwhelmed I was, awestruck and silent. The greats had their phases and palettes—Picasso his blue, Monet his green, the masters their prismed hues. And here I stood, at the dawn of my own work, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers found the instrument of my art, muscles taut and obedient, and the air parted as my will became form. Water danced, clear and sure, flecks of existence surrendered to the void. Muscles clenched again, more insistent, and the hand drove the handle down. Still, the brown mass clung stubbornly, an unwelcome guest in porcelain confines.\n\nWith mop in hand, stance firm, and a tie strangling my neck, I surveyed the crude testament left behind in the Rite Aid restroom. Flush after futile flush, and moments of quiet reflection passed, until I reached for the paper, a makeshift gauntlet forming around my hand. Straightening, then bending, I plunged into the bowl, a mother reclaiming her Thanksgiving fowl...",
            "The roads become a battleground where the young meet their end, their lives snuffed out behind the wheel. There's a confluence of factors that shape this grim ledger of statistics for the youngest of drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health speak of the adolescent mind, unripe and unready for the perils of the open road. Inexperience, too, stands at the core, a silent specter leading them to their doom. It is this lack of experience that not only brings about fatal collisions but an increase in vehicles overturned, a reckless speed, and the veering off into oblivion.\n\nWhen they gather with their kin, the outcome is far more dire, a truth evident to any soul with a shred of sense, for these young riders often travel in packs. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center reveals a stark correlation: the age of those riding alongside and the frequency of wrecks upon the road.\n\nIn places like California, the law seeks to shield these fledgling drivers by imposing provisional licenses that curtail their hours and banish other young passengers from their company. Yet these provisional measures are but a patch upon a greater wound. The truth is plain: these youngest among us, by any measure of statistics, are ill-prepared to shoulder the weight of the wheel. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman holds that even eighteen is too tender an age for the granting of a full license. USA Today bears witness to his findings, revealing a penchant in those not yet twenty to court danger for the heady rush it imparts. It stands to reason then, to defer the granting of this privilege until the fever of thrill-seeking begins to wane. If we persist in bestowing licenses upon these young souls, the carnage will not cease; the death toll shall swell to unthinkable numbers in the coming years. As the children of the Baby Boomers come of age to drive, millions more will take to the highways.\n\nThe crafting of laws to address this need not be a complex affair. Schools might continue the instruction of driving to prepare those who will one day take the wheel, yet none younger than eighteen ought to command a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be given in the time before a full license is awarded, with practical training hours mandated. The number of hours might mirror what states currently require; in California, six hours of wheel-time and fifty in the company of an elder. Given the deadly data drawn from across the nation, a uniform law to guard young drivers would be a reasonable—and I dare say effective—step in securing the safety of our youth.\n\nSuch legislation is not a novel concept, but one of necessity and sense.",
            "In the quiet corridors of the mind's vast expanse, where shadows whisper and echoes linger, there lies a disorder by the name of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, a malady not of the ears but of the soul's perception. It is here that we begin, unfolding the tale of a brain's struggle to make sense of the sounds that dance around it. First, we must define this affliction, and then, we shall peer into the means by which it is known, marked by signs and signals like distant smoke on the horizon. Lastly, we turn our gaze to the classrooms, where teachers, like weary sentinels, seek to guide those beset by CAPD through the fog of misunderstanding.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder as some have called it, speaks to the enigma of the central nervous system's dance with the auditory world. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, in their wisdom of 2005, spoke of it as the CNS's art of utilizing sound, where the fault lies not in hearing but in the alchemy of translation. The ears hear, yet the mind falters, unable to separate the song from the silence, the voice from the void.\n\nIn the annals of history, its earliest echoes resound from the mid-1950s, cloaked in the name of 'auditory imperception.' It was then that pioneers such as Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began their work, crafting tests in the year 1954. Kimura, in 1961, brought forth dichotic testing, weaving a model to unveil the mysteries of the central auditory nervous system. A gathering of minds in 1977 kindled the fires of inquiry into the children who bore this burden.\n\nCAPD reveals itself in myriad forms, a specter of sound and silence. The afflicted may wander through the world unable to discern sound's origin, or fail to tell one noise from another. Patterns of sound elude them, and the cadence of speech, with its subtle shifts, remains a riddle. The past sound is swallowed by the present, and the clues that others weave into meaning are lost upon them, as is the sequence of auditory events.\n\nTo diagnose this specter, one must embark on a journey of observation, through the systematic witnessing of listening and the trials of auditory function. Audiologists, SLPs, and psychologists are the seekers, wielding questionnaires and surveys, their eyes keen upon the behavior of the listener. Yet, no single test holds the key, no cause is known, and the path to understanding remains shrouded. Tests present a cacophony, asking of the listener a deciphering of words and numbers, while others delve deeper, recording the responses within the ear's hidden chambers.\n\nIn the end, CAPD is a silent struggle, a battle waged within, where the ears are but the gatekeepers to a mind that seeks to understand the world it hears, yet finds itself lost amidst the echoes.",
            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, my path leads toward the Division of Family and Children Services, a road marked by the desire to mend what has been broken, to shield the young who have known only neglect or abuse, and to offer a hand to families adrift in the storm. The values I carry into this field are more than mere words; they are the bricks and mortar of my being—service, respect, an unwavering ethical compass, a commitment to better the bonds between people, and a relentless drive to hone my skills so that I remain ever worthy of the task. These values are not solely the province of the social worker; they are the quiet truth of who I am.\n\nFrom my earliest days, the longing to aid others was a constant companion, though the road ahead lay obscured by shadows. High school and college unfolded before me, a parade of souls fleeing from their own shadows, some stumbling into the arms of poor solace. Witness to these struggles, I turned my steps toward a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Yet the path remained elusive, and so I paused upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, fate led me to a friend’s home, where a boy of sixteen sat upon her couch, his eyes wide with the fear of one seeking refuge from the cruelties of his own blood. The tale unfolded—an escape from abuse—and the next dawn brought news that he had called the law to stand against his kin. I went to that place where his parents dwelt, seeking to lend aid, and spoke my concerns to the officers who could do little more than listen. They bid me speak with the parents, and I did, the truth of my fresh degree a thin armor as I faced their nervous words, their justifications for what the boy had done. In that moment, the thought took root within me—a calling to the work of healing such \"simple\" disputes.\n\nIn this calling, there is also the fierce heart of social justice. Society proclaims the worth of the individual, yet in its mourning for the lost, it clings to traditions that bind rather than liberate. If we weep for those who pass, why do we shackle ourselves to the sameness of all? I am an individual, and I reject the chains that would make me otherwise. In the halls of high school and college, I raised my voice against the injustices I saw—my hair a palette of defiance, my clothes a banner of self, my ears adorned beyond the ordinary. I stood with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, stood against the specter of racism and discrimination, whenever and wherever they reared their heads. For social justice is my creed, and I shall not cease in my protest against the injustices of this world.",
            "In the dim corridor of human understanding, there lies the restless specter of insomnia, a disorder as ancient as the stars and as confounding as the shifting sands. This paper, like a lone traveler, seeks to unravel the tangled threads of its origins, peering through the lenses of the Biological and Sociocultural models. The biological model casts its gaze upon the bloodlines, the inheritance of genes and the medical tapestry woven through the flesh. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural model turns its eye to the world outside, the interplay of environment, race, and the unyielding march of socioeconomic forces. This review, a journey through the night, examines the chosen research, explaining, critiquing, and laying bare the strengths and weaknesses found therein.\n\nSleep disorders, those silent thieves of the night, come in many forms. They may stand alone as primary disorders or walk hand in hand with the shadows of mental affliction. The Dyssomnias, those guardians of sleep's gate, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, and Narcolepsy, each a tale of its own. Primary Insomnia, a thief of slumber, while Primary Hypersomnia, a struggle to remain awake, both haunting their victims for no less than a month. Narcolepsy, with its sudden descents into the abyss, speaks of cataplexy and the automatic descent into dreams. The Parasomnias, in contrast, are specters of the night, causing nightmares, terrors, and sleepwalking, each a dance of the mind's shadows. The disorders tethered to mental afflictions, linked to the Axis I and Axis II, weave another story. This review lingers on insomnia, a focus upon the biological and sociocultural realms.\n\nThe biological model, a study of the codes within us, speaks of genes, heritable whispers, and the physiological web that binds. In the hypothalamus, neurons laced with orexin hold the keys to the kingdom of sleep and wakefulness. Studies with mice, those tiny wanderers of science, reveal GABAB receptors on these neurons, gatekeepers of slumber and alertness. Activation of the GABAA receptor ushers in sleep, while its silence brings forth anxiety and wakefulness. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, lengthens the night's embrace (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings, etched in the annals of research, suggest that the mice's tale may echo in the human heart. The genetic and environmental underpinnings of the GABAB receptor unveil a truth: its absence or malfunction may render sleep elusive. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is passed down, it may cast a shadow over life's endeavors, dimming the prospects of learning, work, and the daily grind of existence. And so, the study of insomnia, a journey through the darkness, seeks to illuminate the path forward.",
            "I've roamed these grounds at University Park for nigh on two and a half years now. The corridors of time marked by four and a half semesters. For many and myself among them, the labyrinth of campus is a trial. My first year saw me nestled in an East Halls dormitory, perched at the easternmost edge of this scholar's domain, save for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center's vastness. From my quarters in Stuart Hall to the distant precincts of Willard building, a pilgrimage to the heart of campus demanded twenty-five minutes or more, a journey aggravated by the whims of State College weather. In conversation with an alumnus, a soul not much older than myself, I gleaned tales of yore when East Halls stood apart, isolated by fields of barren earth. Now the void is filled, sports fields and colossal structures like the new Creamery and health services building rising up, apartments encircling them. As the campus sprawls ever outward, the burden of distance grows heavier. How best to traverse this widening expanse? The answer lies in the bicycle. Yet the bicycle alone is but half the battle. Riders must mount them, and the paths must welcome their wheels.\n\nI spoke with a friend, one who had recently returned to the saddle after years away. He pondered aloud why he ever dismounted. \"Bikes are grand,\" he declared. \"Once, it wasn't the fashion to ride, but it's the only way to roam.\" Beyond fortifying the body, the bicycle is a paragon of efficiency. A humble bowl of oatmeal and the turn of a pedal can carry you thirty miles or more. Like many a student, I've taken residence off campus, distances akin to those dormitories. The wisest choice I've made this year was to acquire a bike. Each day, my path leads to Thomas building, a place that demands twenty-five minutes on foot from my door. A bicycle reduces that time to five, if I am swift and the road favors me. Yet the straightforward path of Pollock Road is fraught, a challenge whether mounted or on foot. There are merits in walking, but time is a luxury I do not possess. Without my bike, walking would be my sole recourse, a drain of thirty to forty minutes each day. Hours lost each week, time I cannot afford to squander.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dark vision of a world remade by the hands of men, he lays bare the creeping machinations of technology and the relentless march of capitalism, crafting a realm where the soul is subjugated to the whims of the machine. This brave new world, a place where the collective voice drowns out the solitary whisper, molds its people from birth to seek only the fleeting balm of immediate pleasure. Within this tapestry, the citizens are revealed as mere pieces in a grandiose game, their minds shackled to the dictates of the World Controller. Through the lens of Marxist thought, one glimpses Huxley's wary eye cast upon the constructs of his age. The jargon of Marxism—homogeny, reification—lurks within the narrative, underscoring the novel's commentary on the flaws of the burgeoning economy that rose around him.\n\nIn this satire of capitalism, the specter of false consciousness looms large. The common folk, blind to the chains that bind them to their economic fates, pursue self-interest in a dance orchestrated by unseen hands. This, the fruit of ideological dominion over the masses, stands starkly in Huxley's world. The Delta, the Gamma, and their ilk, robbed of true volition, are driven by the whispers of hypnopædia to consume, to spend, to indulge. Their strings pulled by the World Controller, who enacts a hegemony over their lives, a dominance where the many unknowingly uphold the very structure that ensnares them. The Alphas and Betas, aware yet silent, save for a few like Bernard who dare to question. In this interplay of castes, the heavy hand of capitalism's perceived oppression is made manifest.\n\nIn Huxley's creation, the bonds between souls are mere shadows. The novel draws no lines to separate its players, for even those who stand in the light are but hollow echoes. Here, he suggests that the rise of the machine and the market strips man of his will, his essence. Love is a ghost, and the peaks of emotion are leveled to the plain. Interactions are but surfaces, the men's talk of women reduced to the pneumatic, the women unabashed in their tales of encounters. The unquestioning acceptance of their place within the hierarchy speaks to the socioeconomic toll of capitalism. Their obedience, their unyielding role in the collective, mirrors the Marxist view of the proletariat, led to believe in their own supremacy so long as they consume, conform, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "It was near four years past when I found myself enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A crucible of debate it was, with the class grappling fiercely over the nature of Islam itself, whether it bore hostility in its heart. The question lingers yet, more pertinent perhaps than it ever was. The shadow of 9/11 cast long, and I watched as the media scape shifted, from a scornful gaze upon Islam and its zealots to a peculiar tolerance within the bounds of America. In the year of 2001, it would have been unthinkable for a man named Barack Obama, whose lineage traced to Muslim roots, to stand as a presidential contender.\n\nThe life of the Prophet stirs my interest, for in it I see a dance of contradictions. The history I’ve known paints Muhammad as a conqueror, wielding the sword to spread the faith among tribes. Yet the biographers pen a different tale, casting him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, drawing followers not by force but by the truth they perceived in his teachings. They came to him, so the story goes, as moths are drawn to flame.\n\nThere are echoes of another ministry, that of Jesus, in this narrative of Muhammad’s wonders. The multiplication of mutton and milk for forty men, a miracle reminiscent of the loaves and fishes. I sense the writers’ intent, to craft an image of a prophet unbothered by proof, instead living a life suffused with truth and miracles. Yet, such a portrayal seems to diminish the singular life of Christ, as though they would borrow glory from one to bestow upon another.\n\nIn the biography’s tales, one sees a pattern, a need to establish witness, to mark the conversion to Islam as a voluntary revelation. But the stories often wend their way through the mouths of others, a hearsay chain of so-and-so heard from so-and-so. It leaves the tales suspect, their truth diluted by the distance of voices.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the elevation of Muhammad to a stature of saintly humility and wisdom, a gentle soul. Yet the chronicles of history seem to sing a different song, a discordant tune against this image. I wonder if those who follow Islam today perceive these truths, the history that lies beneath the legend of Muhammad’s ascent.",
            "In the dust of centuries past, the teachings of the Nazarene lay like forgotten stones, left behind by those who sought to build upon them towers of doctrine reaching skyward. In the sweep of history, one sees the faith of Christ drawn ever further from its humble origins, a river swollen and diverted, its course altered by time and the hands of men. The world now turns with a restless awareness, a stirring in the hearts of many toward a horizon not yet seen. Those who cling to the old ways, rooted in tradition, stand steadfast, but their numbers wane, and their voices, though loud, may not carry the weight to halt the tide.\n\nAmidst the faithful, a seed of understanding takes root, a reckoning with the layers laid upon the simple truth long ago. There will be a yearning, a hunger to peel back the years, to strip away the accretions of centuries, and to gaze once more upon the face of the Christ, unadorned and pure. It is a slow turning, a movement that may take the span of lifetimes, but it is inexorable. A great reversal looms on the horizon, a return to the ancient path, a shedding of the burdens of doctrine, down to the bare earth of the man from Galilee.\n\nAs this reversion sweeps across the lands, from the shores of the New World to the old streets of Europe, it will gather the faithful in its wake, drawing them together in a unity of purpose unseen for generations. The church will stand resolute, a shepherd to guide this flock, yet the diversity that once scattered the faithful like seeds upon the wind will coalesce into a singular vision. The distinctions that once divided them—denominations, creeds, and theologies—will blur into a harmony of belief, a testament to the power of a shared journey back to the source.\n\nHistory is a tapestry woven with reversals, a testament to the cycles of human endeavor. The Romans once hunted the followers of Christ, only to later embrace the cross themselves. Our own nation has seen the chains of slavery broken, rising to a place where those once oppressed now lead. And so it will be with this coming reversion, as the faithful seek to unweave the threads of time, to return to the spring from which their faith first flowed. It is a journey that will be guided by a reading of the Nazarene’s words not as rigid law, but as parable and metaphor, a map to guide the soul.\n\nIn the mists of ancient days, before the man from Nazareth walked the dusty roads of Judea, there was only Judaism, the soil from which the new faith would grow. Monotheism, revelation, and the sacred texts of the Hebrews were the bedrock upon which the Romans, in their conquest of Jerusalem, found a people divided—not as one, but in the many faces of Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the nameless multitudes who lived and died by the law. And so, one asks, what has become of this faith since those distant days?",
            "In the gloom of the ironworks and the ceaseless clangor of industry, The Jungle lays bare the raw and unyielding truth of man's nature, a truth steeped in avarice and self-interest. Beneath the facade of civility lies a relentless quest for self-betterment, a pursuit blind to the plight of those who dwell in the shadows below. The tale unfolds within the labyrinthine corridors of the great factories, overseen by owners and managers whose eyes are fixed solely on the expansion of their empires. Their hearts are hardened against the cries of those trampled underfoot, the casualties of their relentless march toward progress. Upton Sinclair's vision is stark, his words painting the sky as a canvas of dark defilement, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A testament to the disregard these titans hold for all that is caught in their wake, be it man or beast, the smoke rises unceasingly, a harbinger of ruin.\n\nWithin this realm of iron and smoke, the well-being of the laborer is cast aside, a mere afterthought in the ledger of wealth. The men who toil within are cogs in a machine, their lives exchanged for the promise of another dollar. Sinclair's words cut to the bone, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The laborers are driven without mercy, their hours long and their recompense paltry, until the day they are discarded, without warning or recourse, to fend for themselves in a world devoid of safety nets. In this era of unbridled capitalism, laws are but whispers against the gale, and the owners reign unchecked, demanding ever more from their workers who toil under the weight of impossible demands. Though Sinclair's narrative does not voice it outright, the silent expectation is clear: endure the torment, for there is no salvation to be found. No agency offers solace, no hand extends in aid. The unions, conceived as bastions of hope, become yet another cog in the infernal machine, exploiting the very souls they claim to protect. The workers, ensnared in this relentless grind, are likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" Thus, the cycle turns unbroken, and the cries of the downtrodden echo unanswered into the void.",
            "In the dim corridors of the mind where shadows weave their tales, Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands, a testament to his own claim of mastery. Here, in the lines that speak of \"Thulé,\" an echo from Virgil rises, whispering of that far island beyond Britain's grasp, the edge of what men dared to know. Virgil's voice indeed calls from the past, yet Poe's gaze wandered further, drawn to the Germanic titans of word. \n\nIn this, the specter of Goethe looms large, for Karl J. Arndt, in his musings on \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" finds mirrors in their verses, a mimicry perhaps, or homage. The Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe’s own Faust, a drama of poetic descent, unspooling over the years, its threads concluding in the year Goethe himself found his end, 1832. Within it, a fragment, \"The King of Thulé,\" tells of a monarch whose heart was lost upon a goblet’s gift, his lady gone to the grave. The weight of memory bends him to drink and mourn until he casts his final treasure to the sea's depths and follows it with closed eyes into the abyss.\n\nIn Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" echoes of this king's sorrowful tread can be felt, shadowed reflections of a soul adrift in drink and grief, perhaps a specter of Poe's own losses. Faust's tale found new life in the hands of H P Grattan in '42, mere moons before Poe's own pen inscribed \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nTwice \"Thule\" rings from Poe's collected voice, once in the pit's dark sway, twice in the land of dreams, a refrain that binds the pieces as kin. Within \"Dream-Land,\" the traveler speaks of Thule's desolate expanse, a place where ghosts keep company and color fades to whispers. A land where Goethe's king might wander, burdened by loss and the specter of rule unclaimed, a place where Poe's imagination might find its reflection.\n\nThrough this, Goethe's shadow stretched across Poe's landscape, a presence felt through the tendrils of Tennyson's acclaim. Though the connection is woven by respect and the tides of literary fashion, it is in the echoes and the spaces between words that Poe found Goethe, and in turn, reflected him.",
            "In the sun-drenched land of California, a question arises from the dust and echoes of commerce. Could a soul, wounded by a fall upon spilled applesauce in a grocer's lane, seek the judgment of punitive damages by revealing the store manager's malice? This, because twice he was told of the mess and yet, wrapped in the solitude of supper, let it linger for a half-hour unheeded.\n\nIn the halls of justice, a judge is unlikely to cast aside Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive recompense without due consideration. To weave such a claim, the plaintiff must unfurl evidence that the defendant’s deeds bore a willful and conscious neglect for the likely harm they sowed, and that such deeds were despicable in nature. Palmer might say that Martin should have foreseen the harm of not cleansing the spill, for in the months before her fall, many patrons of D&D had been felled by similar missteps. Knowing this, he still let the spill remain, a testament to his disregard. Her assertion of Martin's despicable nature may falter, yet it stands on the ground that six such slips had occurred in that fateful year, and still, Martin took no steps to ensure his store's safety.\n\nThat day, October 13, 2009, at the hour of five past the meridian, Rich Wayne, in the employ of D&D Markets, approached his overseer, Paul Martin, to speak of an applesauce spill. Martin, steeped in his meal, dismissed the matter, saying he lacked the time for the woes of the customer. Fifteen minutes later, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, sounded the same alarm, and Martin, unyielding, replied in kind. At the half-hour mark, Jennifer Palmer stepped into the tale, slipping upon the spill, her back grievously hurt. Before Palmer's misfortune, five other such tales had unfolded at D&D in that same year. Now, Palmer seeks due redress for her hurt, both in compensatory and punitive terms, as we ponder the path of a motion to dim the punitive claim’s light.\n\nIn this golden state, one may recover punitive recompense for a breach not born of contract if the defendant wore the mantle of “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010) speaks thus. Malice, the law says, is a deed wrought to harm or, if not so intended, must be “despicable” and done with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). The courts have named a deed malicious when done with eyes wide to the peril it brings, yet the doer, with deliberation, let those perils come, as in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always harbored a yearning, a gnawing hunger that eluded fulfillment. It was a specter that took root around her fourteenth summer, as she waded into the tumult of adolescence, and it lingered still, three years hence, at seventeen. In those years, the amorphous need had coalesced into a desire for companionship rather than possession. Yet no boy stirred her interest. Some had attempted to court her with the clumsiness of youth, drawn by her allure, but all fell short of kindling any spark within her. She wrestled with this enigma, pondering the nature of her peculiar indifference, seeking the source of her anomaly with the earnestness of youth. The years of introspection yielded theories, but none substantial enough to anchor her speculation. And so she moved through her days, a soul adrift in her own quiet inquisition.\n\nHome was a bastion of tranquility. Her parents were gentle souls, their discourse seldom marred by discord. They rarely quarreled, even with their daughter, save for the inevitable clashes with her burgeoning independence and spirited nature. She was the offspring of serenity, yet she injected into their lives a vibrancy that was both a counterpoint and a complement to their calm, endearing herself to all with her genuine warmth.\n\nToday, however, tranquility shattered. As she wandered through the rooms, seeking the elusive muse, a cry pierced the air, sharp and sudden, borne from her mother's lips. Panic surged as she raced to the kitchen, her voice rising in urgent inquiry, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay prone, pain etched on her features, each breath a whispered \"Ow.\" The girl rushed to her side, hand outstretched in a futile attempt to alleviate the hurt. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words tumbled out, compressed by agony, and the daughter knew her mother's suffering was profound. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured, and in that instant, the girl was grateful for the strength she had honed in preparation for such unforeseen trials. She bore her mother to the car, laid her gently in the back, and drove with purpose.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a place of antiseptic odors and fraught with the specter of illness, but she was impervious to its atmosphere, her mind singularly fixated on her mother's plight. She carried her swiftly inside, her voice rising to summon aid, and they came, faces etched with concern, laying her mother upon a rolling bed with practiced haste. They whisked her away to urgent care, leaving the daughter ensconced in a cocoon of anxiety.\n\nHer mother had tumbled from a stepping stool, reaching for a vase ensconced in the highest cabinet.",
            "In the course of this study, the aim was to lay bare the truth that the adherence to what is known as the Mediterranean Diet, or the Med diet, as mirrored in a lofty alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, carries with it a lesser burden of chronic heart disease and stroke and even the grim specter of stroke mortality. The aMed diet stands as a variant of the Med diet, distinguished by a greater presence of plant foods, plant proteins too, casting aside the common potato but embracing fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, a favoring of monounsaturated fats over their saturated brethren, and a turn towards the bounty of the sea in fish, while the consumption of animal products and saturated fats wanes. A moderate measure of alcohol finds its place.\n\nThe chronicles of studies past have drawn forth an inverse association between the Med diet and the specter of death both total and cardiovascular, with interventions revealing the Med diet's prowess over a low-fat regimen, guiding to weight loss and a favorable tilt of the scales in cholesterol in those who carry the weight of obesity. Yet, these studies of old did not cast their gaze upon stroke or the mortality it brings.\n\nThis inquiry delved into the lives of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, their pasts unmarked by cardiovascular disease or diabetes, drawn from the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort woven from 121,700 female nurses across 11 states. Across the span from 1984 to 2004, six times over, an aMed diet score was drawn from the self-reported food frequency questionnaires, instruments crafted to capture the essence of their nutrient intake from the year gone by. A steadfast 95% of nurses remained tethered to this study through the two decades. The FFQs underwent the scrutiny of validation. The shadows of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through the examination of medical and hospital records, autopsies, or the finality of death certificates. Where such records were absent, cases were deemed probable and gathered in, with some 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts thus classified. Measures of body mass index, the smoke of cigarettes, the use of aspirin, the intake of multivitamins, menopausal status, and the postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986 onward, the leisure pursuits of physical activity were noted.\n\nTo quell the capriciousness of random variation and to better capture the essence of long-standing dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were taken, melding together scores from two years past. Adjustments were made to account for the confounders, those beguiling factors that could cloud the truth, by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling became the tool with which to discern the relation between an aMed score and the specter of CHD and stroke, separate models crafted for the fatal and the nonfatal, and for the varied strokes.\n\nGreater fidelity to the Mediterranean way, as captured in a loftier aMed diet score, bore a kinship with a lesser risk of CHD and stroke in women. Across two decades of vigilance, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 strokes, and 1077 deaths by cardiovascular disease, the fatal CHD and strokes alike, were recorded. Those women who stood in the top aMed quintile found themselves at a diminished risk for both CHD and stroke when set against those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk standing at 0.71.",
            "The sign proclaimed that Hitler lives in Burma. Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, stood solitary on a street corner, a piece of cardboard hoisted aloft, the message scrawled in Sharpie, stark against the world. Burma, or Myanmar they call it now, a land under the yoke of a military junta, power seized in the coup of '62. In 2007, they rose, the people, the monks in their saffron robes leading the way, the streets alive with the spirit of a decade-long silence broken. The Saffron Revolution they named it, for the color of the robes, for the monks who dared the junta's wrath. At first, the government turned a blind eye, a charade of peace, but the tide turned red and the monasteries became battlegrounds, soldiers storming through sacred halls. Foreign eyes, the lenses of journalists, they were sought out, silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, fell on September 27th, 2007, a casualty of witness. Thirteen dead, they say officially, but Colonel Hla Win, who turned against his own, whispers of thousands, of bodies uncounted and unseen.\n\nThis is the world's old song. Tyranny's hand upon the throats of the dissenters, a tale as aged as time itself. The Romans called their emperors divine, chosen by gods to rule with iron fist. In Japan, the emperors walked as gods among men, heralds of prosperity and ritual, and here in our own land, George W. Bush converses with Ted Haggard, a man steering fools under the banner of the Republic Party.\n\nHistory is littered with such shadows. Tiananmen, June 4th, 1989, where the young and the intellectuals and the workers stood against their rulers. The numbers of the dead, a secret held tight by the Chinese government, spoke of a few hundred, but others tell of thousands fallen. Rwanda's blood-soaked earth in the '90s, Hutu against Tutsi, a government and its militia in lockstep, a genocide. And the specter of Hitler's Reich, where the Jewish people were hunted across nations, a dark chapter etched in the annals of time.\n\nThis tale is old, and still, it unfolds.",
            "In the annals of jazz, Duke Ellington stands like a lone figure etched against a forlorn sky, his legacy a testament to the endurance and artistry that shaped his orchestra like the hand of a sculptor upon wet clay. His touch upon the piano keys whispers soft like the wind through the pines, yet as a composer, he weaves tapestries rich and complex, each thread a testament to the talent within his band. He built cathedrals of sound where the soloist roams free, yet he penned with precision, calling upon the unique voices of his players to illuminate the dark corners of his compositions. In this, he crafted a sound that was both singular and vast, a sound where each piece fit into a grand mosaic of innovation and brilliance.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington's sound, a sound like no other, citing Creole Love Call, where the voice is wielded as a jazz instrument, a texture and color unburdened by words. This early work stands as a testament to his ability to compliment and elevate the soloist's style, a thread woven throughout his career. It moves slow, deliberate, a twelve bar blues with six choruses:\n\nFirst, a call and response, voice and reeds, the voice smooth as river stones, then rough as the crags of a mountain.\nNext, the muted trumpet sings, stretching the melody with blue notes that hang like twilight.\nThen, a clarinet soars high, the piano beneath it a subtle dance.\nThe full band echoes, brass and reeds answering each other in echoes of the first.\nThe fifth chorus rises, reeds calling high, syncopated brass and rhythm beneath.\nAnd finally, the voice and reeds return, the growl technique transforming the voice into an instrument itself.\n\nEllington's use of voice, a brushstroke of tone color, is a thread that runs through the tapestry of his work. In Hot and Bothered, a year hence, his orchestration is tight, his ear for tone color sharp. There, “Bubber” Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing engage in a call and response as rich as the earth, creating a sound that is both vocal and instrumental. And in It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), these ideas find further expression, as Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody, a cornerstone in the architecture of Ellington's orchestra.",
            "In the slow and relentless march of time, creatures shift and change, molded by forces both seen and unseen. One might wonder why these beings twist and turn upon their path of evolution, what barriers or guides might steer them along their course. The old wisdom of D’Arcy Thompson from the year nineteen and seventeen still whispers its quiet truth, that the heart of nature's forms eludes the grasp of numbers, an enigma yet unsolved. But the age has advanced, and in its wake, men have begun to use the language of mathematics to probe the secrets of the mollusk’s curving shell, through the journey of its life and the long tale of its kind (as pondered by Raup and Stanley in the year nineteen and eighty-one). With this study, we seek to weave together the strands of mathematical modeling and the tangible world of experiment, to uncover the hidden gears and levers that drive the evolution of the Prunum's form.\n\nIn this task, we took to the shadows cast by X-rays upon the shells of Prunum, seeking the lines and curves that tell their story. These we fed to the machine, the one they call CerioShell, born of Stone in nineteen and ninety-five, and from its calculations arose visions of shells that might be, to trace the limits of their potential change. These findings, in concert with the raw observations of nature, aim to cast light upon the great turning of macroevolution in this lineage.\n\nImagine a shell as a passage spiraling through the ages, each turn a whorl upon an unseen axis, the columella its spine. The whorls grow with a mind of their own, and a line, the suture, marks their boundaries. The greatest of these whorls is the last, the body whorl, while the spire rises above, its apex pointing to the heavens, and the base grounding it below. Out of this creation, the creature ventures forth through the aperture, its gateway to the world.\n\nIn viewing these shells, one might gaze from the apex, the base, the aperture, or the opposite side. And to count the whorls, one must see from above, finding the first suture and drawing a line to divide the shell, to reckon each turn from that mark, even to the quarter of a whorl.\n\nConsider the shell as a series of open doors, each a moment in time, as the creature builds its home. The path of the aperture can be traced by the coordinates of its journey, the radius both wide and tall. This trajectory, a story woven in numbers, can be altered by shifting the variables, thus changing the blueprint of the mollusk's creation.",
            "In the sprawling archipelago of Indonesia, the measure of life’s fragile beginnings has stood unmoved these past ten years, a stillness that echoes in the halls of hospitals and the quietude of rural clinics. While the nation strides toward the Millennium’s beckoning goals, meeting the calls for clean water and the sanctity of sanitation, the cries of mothers and the breath of infants tell a different tale. The path to the promised land of health for child and mother remains fraught, the goals set for 2015 a distant mirage. The reasons for this failure lie buried in the bones of a weakened system, a system in need of fortification rather than mere programmatic patchwork.\n\nIn the crowded rooms where life begins, there is now a greater presence of skilled hands, yet the promise is hollow. Seventy-two percent of births boast such attendance, but the skill is oft possessed by those whose hands are bound by tradition, midwives who cannot wield the tools of intervention when the blood flows too freely. The shadow of maternal death looms large, the specter of hemorrhage ever-present. And so the numbers that speak of progress are but whispers in the wind, masking the vast expanse of work yet undone. Meanwhile, the children suffer, their small bodies wracked with illness, and the hands of health professionals grow scarce in the treatment of their fevered sickness. The records of care after birth are fragmented and incomplete, yet they tell enough of a story—a narrative of neglect that spans the nation.\n\nIn the matter of Cesarean births, the statistics are telling, the figures languishing at a meager four percent, a testament to the inequities that divide this land. In the cities, the rate climbs to seven, yet in the remote corners, it falls to two. The disparity in service is a chasm carved by geography and wealth, the cities drawing the lion's share of care while the rural lands are left wanting. And within this division lies another tale of inequity, the chasm between rich and poor, a gap of twenty-seven percent in the use of services. The poor, ever at the margins, find themselves adrift in a sea of costs beyond their means.\n\nAs the nation contemplates its course, the question looms large: how best to mend this fabric of care? Should the focus be sharp and singular, a programmatic spear aimed at the heart of the issue, or should the strengthening of the system be broad and deep, encompassing the full breadth of life’s journey from womb to world? The allure of targeted programs is strong, their objectives clear and results swift. But the siren song comes with a price. To pour resources into one vein of the health sector is to starve another, to draw the lifeblood of human talent to where the money flows quickest, leaving other fields barren. The specter of international funding for HIV/AIDS casts a long shadow over family planning, a lesson in the perils of such a path. And so too, the proliferation of parallel programs breeds a forest of forms and a tangle of red tape, a bureaucracy that serves itself more than those it was meant to aid.",
            "The annals of Popular Music stretch long in the shadows of time, a century's worth of sound and fury that resists confinement in neat little boxes. These sounds, unruly as a wild river, branch into countless tributaries—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and beyond—each spawning a profusion of sub-genres, sub-sub-genres, a tangled web of sonic exploration. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal has, over the past four decades, become a realm of manifold voices. Its expression is raw and unyielding, a tapestry woven from the darker threads of human emotion. This diversity, birthed from the genre's inception, revealed a flexibility that musicians seized upon, crafting sub-genres and further still until the music became a labyrinth of its own making. \n\nAnd now, as we stand amidst the cacophony of heavy metal's evolution, the essence of what defines it seems to blur, absorbed as it is with themes borrowed from other realms of music. Its roots, however, remain, for understanding the sprawling edifice of metal today demands a reckoning with its origins, its nature as a movement transcending mere genre.\n\nMetal is a journey through shadow, a pursuit of the infinite. It is a sound of excess—more bass, more volume, more violence, more spectacle. It is less the primitive beat, more the virtuoso's touch; the musicians are craftsmen, their mastery evident in every note. Metal, unsurprisingly, is a journey often fueled by the mind-altering haze of drugs. In the mid-seventies, a psychedelic tide swept minds to the brink, birthing records that spoke in tongues of madness and otherworldly visions. These qualities, visceral and dark, struck a new chord in the music scene, a scene where much of what was popular dared not tread into such shadowed realms. Successive waves of metal drew from these dark waters, echoing the Romantic Era’s penchant for the visceral and sublime. The darkness runs like a black thread through the lyrics, a staple of the movement, a whisper of the abyss.\n\nConsider, if you will, the song Helter Skelter, the Beatles' own foray into the depths. It is a song that ascends and descends, a reflection of the mind's tumultuous journey under the influence. Some whisper it to be among the first born of Heavy Metal, a response to the Rolling Stones’ own darkened tune. The Beatles, in their rivalry, sought to prove they could summon the heaviness of the Stones, casting this track into the world from the depths of The White Album.",
            "In the years before the surrealists set their dreams to canvas, Henri Rousseau crafted his own visions from the fabric of his soul. The Dream, painted in 1910, stands as a testament not merely to the wonder of lands traversed in dreams but to the yearnings and aspirations that stirred within Rousseau's heart. Here is a woman cast in awe, and here too lies Rousseau, a painter longing for the embrace of recognition and the praise of his peers. From the outset, he was beset by the vexing choice: to mimic the styles that would grant him entry into the hallowed halls of the art world or to forge his own path, unshackled and defiant.\n\nTo lay eyes upon The Dream, one must first know the dreamer himself. Born May 21, 1844, in the shadowed town of Laval in the northwest of France, Rousseau's beginnings were humble. His father, a tinsmith by trade, lived a life of modest means. Rousseau's hands knew no art in his youth, only the labor of a gabelou, a toiler of municipal tolls, though the world knew him falsely as a douanier. In his personal life, tragedy was a constant companion. The death of his wife Clémence, preceded by the loss of eight children, left him with only a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief. With brush and canvas, Rousseau sought solace, a new dawn in the midst of despair. Unlike his contemporaries who painted the peasantry with romance, Rousseau was of the folk, a dreamer of dreams that echoed the common man's heart.\n\nTo yearn for acceptance is a human thing, and given his journey, Rousseau's fervent desire to be embraced by the art world is understandable. Untrained, commencing his true calling late, he labored in the shadow of giants. Recognition came slowly, only as Matisse was carving his own niche. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of the two as rivals yet not, their purposes diverging. Matisse, a man driven by the fear of banality, while Rousseau's wish was to paint with such convention that he might be welcomed into the Artiste Français. Yet in that desire lay the paradox of his existence.",
            "In the quiet corridors of thought where the world’s thinkers have often wandered, there lies a tether binding ethics to aesthetics, truth to beauty. At the core of it all, there is a reason, something elemental. Keats, with his Grecian urn, whispers to us that beauty is truth and truth beauty. That alone is the knowing granted to us in this world. Our journey through life imparts knowledge through the rigors of education or the trials of experience, yet there are things deeper still, understood without instruction. Ethics and aesthetics, you see, are less commandments than they are whispers of understanding. Our exploration of morality and art seeks not to lay down laws but to uncover the mysteries of what makes art resonate or an action noble.\n\nIn the telling of art’s worth or moral’s measure, the conversation dances around but never quite holds the essence in its grasp. Take da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, a subject of myriad discussions—foreground, background, contrast, and culture. Yet none capture why it stands as art. When asked of a beloved piece, a soul might say, “There’s just something about it,” before delving into critique. Art and morality resist reduction to mere qualities. As O’Connor wisely notes, a story unveils what mere statements cannot. All descriptions of literature leave something transcendent. Ethics, too, shares this nature. Wittgenstein muses that ethics cannot be spoken, for it transcends. It is this ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, that is the true strength of art and morality, forging the link between them.\n\nMorality and art wend their way to us in the realm of the noumenal, as Kant might term it. They touch us in ways that defy full explanation. Literature, especially, bears this bond with the moral. As McKean observes, literature’s distinction lies in its moral quality. Other arts might escape such standards, but literature’s very essence is intertwined with the values of life. Living is entwined with values, and literature matters because it reflects those very values back to us.",
            "In the land of Germany as it stands now, a robust and unified presence lingers. From the shadowed embrace of the Alps in München to the northern reach of Kiel by the Baltic Sea, the cultural tapestry weaves its way through the country. It is felt along the banks of the Rhine in Köln, threading its path to Dresden where the Elbe flows. To see Germany's culture as a singular entity is to overlook the myriad threads that form its history, echoing from tribes long past.\n\nGermania, the cradle of the Germanic soul, holds a name whose roots are tangled in scholarly debate. Tacitus, in his accounts, spoke of the Tungrians, a tribe he claimed once bore the name German before they ventured across the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. It was Julius Caesar who first inscribed “Germanus” in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, a term lifted from the Gauls to set apart those he had vanquished from those who stood unconquered, the latter crossing the Rhine with a mischievous intent. Some, in their conjectures, propose it was a Gaulish word for a neighbor, while others see it as tied to the Germanic spear, the ger, or the Old Irish garim, a shout that marked the Germans as loud and fierce.\n\nTacitus, in his stoic prose, penned “De Origine et situ Germanorum” in AD 98, speaking of a people aboriginal, untouched by the tides of migration. He mused that no man would forsake the fertile lands of Asia or Africa for the harsh terrain and sullen skies of Germania unless it was the call of home. For who in their right mind would leave Rome for such a place? Not the Romans, not then. They sent their armies to the edges of Germania, thirsting for its bounty, yet always they turned back to the sprawling heart of their empire. As the Germanic tribes took form in the first century, they lingered on the empire's periphery, trading and serving among the Roman ranks, their skills honed by the land they called home (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the shroud of disguise wends its way through the soul’s corridors, a tool both cunning and perilous. This masquerade, crafted to deceive, must ultimately be cast off, lest the wearer be consumed by its shadow, leaving only echoes of identity behind. The unraveling of deception bears its own burden—alienation, a severing of bonds once held dear. Thus, one stands at a crossroads, the heart torn between the sanctity of self and the fragile tapestry of human connection. For while some may look upon the ruse with indifference, others shall find offense in the unmasking, their trust shattered like glass upon the stones.\n\nThe intricate dance of deception twines with the reversal of gender roles, raising questions that linger like specters in the mind's recesses. Chief among them is the bewildering query: why? What compels one to forsake their own visage and don the garb of another gender? Viola's plight answers with the voice of survival: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). In lands unknown, Viola cloaks herself in masculinity to stave off danger, her guise a shield against the world’s brute forces. Yet this guise estranges her from the womenfolk, severing her from their solace and strength. Her deception, so artfully wrought, ensnares Olivia in a web of confusion, blurring the lines between Cesario and Sebastian, leading to a love misplaced: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). And still, she carries the weight of unspoken ardor, a flame flickering between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nIn this tangled skein, Twelfth Night speaks to the modern soul, revealing how deceit may unlock the heart’s hidden chambers, drawing forth desires long buried. The shadows of Olivia and Orsino’s hearts suggest yearnings unspoken, desires unbidden, brought to light by Viola’s masquerade. Does Olivia’s heart lean toward Cesario for the semblance of manhood, or does it whisper of a deeper truth, a love for women that dares not speak its name? Yet, it seems more likely that Olivia mirrors the follies of her time, where judgment clings to the surface, to the fleeting beauty of countenance. Her swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, her embrace of Cesario/Viola as kin rather than lover, sings of this transformation: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "The German colonial dominion, a vast and unruly beast, was remarked upon by many for its cruelty, most vividly in the blood-drenched lands of German South West Africa where the Ovaherero and Nama peoples met their grim fate. Yet an empire so sprawling as this cannot be easily reckoned with a single tale of savagery. It was a tapestry of many colors, each colony a world unto its own with laws and manners as diverse as the lands they governed. In the realm of education too was such variance. When the British laid claim to German East Africa, known as Tanganyika, in the year 1919, they encountered a multitude of Africans not only schooled but literate. The Germans had sown seeds of learning across their holdings in Kamerun and beyond, earning the admiration of those who chronicled such endeavors.\n\nYet in the arid expanse of South West Africa, what they now call Namibia, the story was a different one. There, unlike in the green expanses of East Africa where the state had seen fit to build schools and take charge of educating the native populace, the burden fell almost entirely to missionaries, who struggled with scant aid from the government. It was the Europeans who received the state’s largess, with schools established for their benefit and missionary efforts therein strictly overseen and supported. The legacy of these policies lingered long after the Germans departed, leaving behind a land where the vast majority of its people remained untouched by the light of learning, their minds unawakened, their hands unlettered. The reasons for this divergence lay buried in the complex soil of social, political, and economic circumstance. This paper seeks to unearth these factors, guided by fresh inquiry into the hearts and minds of settlers and those who ruled them.\n\nThe annals of education under the German flag are rich, penned mostly in the mother tongue of those who sought to document the ways of teaching in lands far from home. These early works served to describe what was, laying bare the bones of the educational systems in the colonies. Later, voices speaking in English broadened the conversation, comparing the schools of different colonies and plumbing the depths of their particularities. They revealed a world of contrasts. Among these, Cohen’s study stands as a keystone, examining the schools of South West Africa and East Africa and unraveling the threads that set them apart. He points to the settlers of South West Africa, a people drawn to its mild climes amidst the desert's embrace, as a key to understanding the peculiarities of its schools.\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to the other lands held by Germany, offered a climate more forgiving, though much of it was swallowed by the barrenness of desert. The Europeans flocked to it, finding it more welcoming than other colonies. By 1913, the land bore witness to nearly 15,000 white souls, while East Africa, holding the next largest gathering of settlers, counted but 5,336.",
            "There was a time when the United States of America and the lands of Mexico were bound in a rivalry that stretched across the years like a shadow over the desert, a span of fifty-seven years from 1836 to 1893. It was a time marked by conflict, the high-water mark of which was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. Here the United States moved with force and took from Mexico the lands of Texas and what would become the American Southwest. Other confrontations followed, a simmering flame that would last until just before the Great War. These two nations were locked in a struggle, their differences rooted deep in matters of faith and custom, and in the clash of their material desires. \n\nBut this tale is not unique in the chronicles of nations. For those who share a border often find themselves at odds, their interests clashing like the meeting of two rivers. The United States and Mexico were no different from many such enduring rivalries that mark the history of neighboring lands. David M. Pletcher once spoke of the long shadows cast by these old American diplomatic problems, their roots tangled in the lands of Mexico and Cuba. These are the two that sit closest to the heart of the United States, while other brethren in Latin America have known times of peace and good relation.\n\nSo it was that religious discord drove a wedge between these two nations, a rift as old as the hills, and no stranger to the annals of human history. As Sally Frahm tells it, in those days past, Americans set themselves against the creeds of Catholicism and the rule of monarchy, just as in the later years they would stand against the specters of fascism and communism. This was a struggle of ideologies, not unlike the Cold War that would follow, yet rooted in the faith of the people, a legacy inherited from the distrust that lay between English and Spanish blood. A legacy that forged a barrier to peace between the United States and Mexico.\n\nIn the reckoning of Diehl and Goerts, there were seventeen disputes that marked the years of this rivalry. Most of them were born of territorial matters, of raids across borders and the lawlessness of the frontier. Bandits and outlaws ranged wild, a trouble that lingered until both nations brought forth their military might to tame the edges of their lands. Yet, as the years passed, the rivalry began to wane. Schmitt tells us it was because Mexico found itself in need of what the United States could offer, and the ambitions of America turned from the hunger for lands to the pursuit of economic influence in Mexico in the late days of the nineteenth century.",
            "Fifteen years past I found myself felled by an ailment unknown to me before. A sudden and unwelcome visitor that took hold and did not let go.\n\nI once wore the garb of a nurse. A choice born not from dreams but from necessity, a yearning for the security denied me in younger days. They said, you will always find work for the world is ever sick. And so the words echoed through the corridors of my youth. Though I longed to tread the paths of science or to wield the pen of a journalist, I chose the way of nursing.\n\nAnd there I stood at forty-six, alone and with little to my name, unable to labor. Still, the years have passed and I remain tethered to Social Security, owning nothing but the grit of survival. Each day is a trial, a siege upon my sense of safety and self-worth. Certainty is a ghost, yet one truth remains: I have endured these years only through the kindness of kin and the grace of friends. For when calamity comes, it strips away the facade of strength.\n\nLife is a series of emergencies, large and small. No promises are made and no preparation is ever enough for the burdens that may come. \n\nI see the cracks in the grand edifice of governance and understand the call for less reliance on it. But I would rather we turn to one another, learn again to trust and to aid, than to retreat into solitary fortresses of our own making.\n\nThe tales of old speak of rugged souls who carved this land, yet it was not solitary strength but shared compassion and resources that steadied them through the trials. Those who traversed the mountains in their caravans did not reach the ocean by solitude.\n\nSo yes, prepare. I do. A kit for disaster, supplies for wounds, tablets to cleanse water, and coverings for windows should the unthinkable arise. Flashlights and batteries, candles and matches sealed against the wet. Canned goods aplenty. If you have the means to till the earth and preserve its bounty, do so. A wood stove, too, if your home permits.\n\nBut as you gather these things, do not forget your neighbors.",
            "In the dim recesses of antiquity, sometime in the shadowy folds of the fifth or sixth century before the common era, there was a prince born into this world who would one day be known as the Buddha. His life was a journey away from princely pleasures, a path that led him to renounce the world and find a light within, a light that birthed a way of living that came to be known as Buddhism. Among the many branches that grew from this seed, Theravada stands as the most orthodox, a tradition that has seen the passage of twenty-five centuries and bears little resemblance to what the Buddha may have known. In distant lands like Sri Lanka, this change is visible in rituals such as the water-cutting ceremony, a practice untouched by the Buddha's teachings yet imbued with sacred meaning. The transformations, they run deep, from the surface of tradition to the very core of salvation. The Theravada community, both the robed and the unrobed, has bent and swayed to the winds of time, shaped by forces that are both of this world and outside it, forces both kind and cruel.\n\nTo trace these shifts, one must reckon with the terms of discourse. Internal and external, these are the markers of origin, the former arising from within the fold of the Buddhasasana, be they monk or layman, and the latter from those outside its sanctuary. Hostile forces, they bear the weight of scornful eyes, while benign forces drift indifferent, bringing change unbidden. These words will loop and twine through the telling.\n\nLet us turn to the heart of the matter, the doctrines that pulse at the center of Theravada Buddhism. The faithful find their refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a corpus of teachings known as the Tripitaka, unfolds in three: the Sutta Pitaka with its sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka with its rules for the monastic life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka with its deeper metaphysical musings. Metaphysical notions like Anatta, the absence of self, Dukkha, the ever-present suffering, and Anicca, the impermanence that colors all things. Only by seeing these truths can one step off the wheel of Sansara, the endless cycle of birth and death. Enlightenment brings an end to the trio of lobha, dosa, and moha—desire, hatred, and delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the precepts for living: five for the laity, many more for the monks. At the heart lies the teaching of the four noble truths: life is suffering, suffering springs from attachment, and suffering can be transcended."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the quiet chambers where men gather to negotiate, culture looms like a shadow cast by a great and ancient mountain. It is not a singular entity, nor is it a monolith of understanding. Culture is as much defined by its absences as by its presence, a tapestry of what it signifies and what it does not. It is a mistake to suppose it homogenous or singular, for it is neither. To say all Russians are obstinate or all Japanese accommodating is to speak in the broadest of tongues, to simplify beyond recognition. A wiser path for the negotiator is to grasp the weight and shape of culture in the matter at hand, to see how its unseen hand might guide the course of talk and barter. When a man walks among foreign customs, he sees them through the lens of his own, and comparisons bloom like wildflowers in the desert.\n\nTo grasp the heart of another culture is a journey that might begin with its history or its prejudices laid bare. It is not for one to judge or to change what has been wrought by time and tide, but to accept and navigate its bounds, especially when one's own bargaining strength is but a whisper. In foreign lands, respect for the old ways and beliefs is a bridge over chasms unseen, smoothing the path of discourse.\n\nYet culture is not merely confined to the borders of nations. Within a single land, companies craft their own ethos, their own corporate spirit. Some laude the long hours that stretch into the night, others a more measured pace. The essence of these cultures is woven into the fabric of the employee's garb, the cadence of their speech, the delegation of tasks. Some encourage giving to the world’s needs, others hold tight to approved causes. The American corporate landscape is as varied as the land itself, a mosaic of thought and practice.\n\nThe values that underpin a culture are the keys to its soul. If honor and harmony are cherished, a man will not shame his kin before the gathered eyes in pursuit of victory. If the hard bargain is held aloft, he will not rush to close the deal at first light. These truths must be held close as one approaches the table, yet to know the man across from you, to see him as more than an emblem of his world, this is the heart of true negotiation.",
            "The fool says in his heart, There is no God. These words echo first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and find repeated life in the opening of St. Anselm’s discourse on the divine. This notion, this reaching toward the divine, is shared by another mind, Thomas Aquinas. Both men, their thoughts twined around the existence of God, stand before us. Our task is to weigh their claims, to decide whose argument bears the greater truth. Let us assume, for brevity’s sake, that both agree on the God of the Bible. Any deviation from this figure would render the comparison of their defenses moot, as they argue for one singular vision of the divine. Yet I would contend that neither crafts a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo draw this out, we first turn our gaze upon St. Anselm. His words speak of understanding through faith, a journey into oneself to find the mark of God. He asserts that because God dwells within our understanding, we cannot truly imagine a world without Him. Though his language may stumble into the tedious and the obscure, the core remains: God’s proof lies within the mind’s own recesses. Anselm suggests that truth about God is not a foreign thing but is instead rooted in what we know to be true within. No external evidence is demanded. This notion of embracing what cannot be proven by the empirical is often called faith within Christian speak.\n\nAquinas, on the other hand, walks a different path. He believes God’s existence can be proven through reason and evidence, leaving faith aside. Such a stance could serve the call of evangelism, a cornerstone of Christianity, by allowing conversions swayed by pure logic, untouched by the need for blind belief. Aquinas presents five logical roads to God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he argues that God’s proof is a logical necessity. Just as one knows the missing piece of a puzzle by the pieces that remain, so too does logic dictate the presence of the divine.",
            "In the craft of storytelling, authors wield their prose like a blade, carving out feelings and attitudes that resonate deep within the reader. Some forge their words with greater deftness than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his opus The Great Gatsby, employs a multitude of such techniques. He pairs adjectives and nouns in unexpected unions, weaving an aura that clings to the narrative like mist. At times, he imbues symbols with meaning, using them as vessels to carry the weight of emotion and thought. Such is his method with colors—gold, green, white, gray, red, pink—all pigments stained with purpose.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald paints his world with hues of white and gray, each brushstroke deliberate, each shade steeped in significance. White, a facade of elegance and class; gray, the pallor of age and decay. From the outset, these colors drape the scenes, omnipresent. Daisy and Jordan, ever clad in white, float through the pages like specters in a dream. Nick dons white flannels to Gatsby's gathering, Tom sports a white shirt in Myrtle’s company, and Catherine is powdered in milky white. The rare absence of white comes when Nick surveys the garish kaleidoscope of Gatsby's revelry.\n\nFitzgerald casts these colors over the mundane and the unremarkable. Nick descends through the alabaster canyons of lower New York, guests at Gatsby’s soirées are nothing but gray names on a ledger, Catherine's abode is a mere slice of a long white cake, a testament to anonymity. The world is populated by white girlhoods and gray lands, gray cars and gray men, all swallowed by the ashes of their own insignificance.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has woven enough meaning into white and gray, he turns them upon his subjects, marking them with insignificance. Daisy, after a long absence of these shades, emerges cloaked in white, driving a little white roadster, a figure rendered uniform by desire rather than substance, an object of Gatsby's unyielding longing. As she moves through the narrative, the gray haze of her fur collar and the white of her gown become emblems of a life lived on the periphery, a mere echo of uniformity amidst the chaos of dreams.",
            "In the sun-drenched expanse of San Diego County, where the earth yields its bounty beneath a mild and constant sky, the land is a testament to the fecundity of creation. Here the fields are sown with tomatoes and citrus and the tender greens of leafy vegetation. Squash and broccoli flourish under the watchful sun, while herbs and tree fruits—peaches and lemons—hang heavy on bending branches. Berries ripen, honey glistens in the comb, and peppers burn with the promise of heat. Such is the wealth of this land, where organic community supported agriculture finds fertile ground and the demand outpaces the supply, with waiting lists that stretch long and hopeful. The eggs and milk from these farms are coveted, the hens and cows raised in the manner of the old ways. The land itself opens to those who seek it, offering tours and trails for those who would wander among the rows, and birds, too, find sanctuary in this place.\n\nThe endeavor of organic farming, though, is not without its burdens. It bears an economy of its own, costly in labor and time, for the farmer must walk the fields to pluck weeds by hand and send pests fleeing without the aid of poison. The soil must be nurtured with care, and the losses, they say, can be greater than the gains, for the scale of a small farm cannot match the great industrial sprawl. Yet in this toil there is also the hope of greater life, for the absence of chemicals brings a richness to both plant and creature, a diversity that speaks to the soul. To manage this land is to dance with the seasons, to plant cover crops and rotate the grazing, to root out the invaders and shape the growth to create a tapestry of habitat.\n\nThe land in question lies near the town of Potrero, a stretch of 160 acres where chaparral and Mediterranean grasses mingle with the oaks, a place bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This is the East County Southern Foothills, a part of the great San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, still under scrutiny, considers the fate of over one hundred species, among them the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. The butterflies and the California gnatcatcher find a tenuous home here, and the burrowing owl watches with eyes that hold the wisdom of decline.\n\nOnce, this land was home to the Native Americans, their presence woven into the very fabric of the earth. Cattle ranchers came in the 1800s, and the land was parceled for grazing and the cutting of wood. Now, in seeking the future, I turned to the records, searching for government aid and knowledge, pondering what a small farmer might do to balance the scales of cost and conservation. In this quest, I found an organic farm, a model of what might be, standing resilient in the same blessed region.",
            "There is a tether between brothers that is not easily severed, a bond forged in the crucible of shared blood and shared experience that cannot be undone. Within it lies a tumult of emotions, love and pride and jealousy and cruelty, vying for space in a heart too small to contain them all. Brothers know each other in ways that no other can, seeing in the other a reflection of themselves. It is when the world bears down with all its weight that this bond reveals its true nature, whether it be light or dark. The cost of clarity is steep, for to understand these emotions is to reckon with their consequences. To look into a brother's eyes and see oneself is to see not the visage the world perceives but the unvarnished truth of one's own soul. It is in the deeds done and the aftermath they leave behind that a man's true character is etched.\n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers walk this path, their hearts a battleground of emotions as they traverse a landscape that is lush and unforgiving. They embark on a journey doomed to failure, where bitter disappointment and fierce pride clash in a moment that leaves only one brother standing. This theme unfurls through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and the interplay between him and his brother, narrated in a voice heavy with the weight of complex feelings and a world perceived through the narrow lens of youth.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by one emotion above all: pride. From the first venture with his frail brother, Doodle, to their final, ill-fated journey, resentment festers in his heart. He had envisioned a brother to whom he could impart the secrets of the world, the art of holding breath, the thrill of running, the joy of climbing the vines that hung in Old Woman Swamp. A companion to race to Horsehead Landing, to perch with him in the great pine's highest fork behind the barn. Yet Doodle, born with a heart weak as a moth's wing, could not fulfill these dreams. The young boy's fantasies were shattered, his dreams dashed in an instant.\n\nIn his anger, the thought of ending the small child's life flickered through his mind, a dark thread in the tapestry of his thoughts. What child, in the innocence of youth, harbors such grim thoughts? And yet, when Doodle smiled at him, the darkness receded. That simple act kindled hope in his heart, revealing that the desire to harm was but a shadow, insubstantial against the deep-rooted love he held for his brother. It was instinctive, a bond unbreakable despite the tumult within.",
            "The human mind is a labyrinthine creation, a web of thought and memory, a vessel of mystery. In ages past, as man rose from the dust and forged tools from stone, so did his understanding of the mind evolve from simple to profound. At first, it was likened to clay, then to parchment, then to the written page, and now to the machine of silicon and light. Yet, let not these comparisons deceive, for they are but shadows on the wall, prone to lead astray.\n\nIn the beginning, there is the world. The senses stand as sentinels at the gate, transforming the raw and the real—touch, heat, the echo of sound, the dance of light—into the language of the mind, a dialogue of electricity and chemistry. This information, thus transformed, journeys through the labyrinth, guided by the unseen hand of the brain’s own making. It rises from the ground up, building from the base elements of color and line, the boundaries where one thing ends and another begins, to form the whole. And yet, from above, from the heights of knowing, the mind descends to meet it, shaping understanding with what it has learned before, until one sees not just a box of black upon white, but knows it for what it is.\n\nAttention, that fickle arbiter, stands watchful, determining what shall pass and what shall fade into the backdrop of the mind’s eye. A thousand blades of grass may sway beneath one’s gaze, yet the mind chooses to see but the ground beneath the feet. And yet, in the clamor of voices, it plucks a name from the air, sharp and clear. Through this dance of perception, the mind moves, ever refining, ever deciding.\n\nFor the mind to weave its intricate patterns, it must first gather and store the threads of thought. Memory is its loom, with many chambers—sensory, immediate, enduring. It begins with the act of encoding, a translation into forms that the mind may hold. Words may be seen, heard, or known in essence, each pathway its own. Once captured, these threads of memory are held by the mind’s unseen hands. In fleeting moments, they are recalled by an electric dance between neurons. In the depths of time, they rest in the architecture of life itself, woven into the fabric of being.\n\nAnd so, the mind constructs its knowledge, laying pathways that echo the steps of thought, some crafted by the mind’s own recall, others by the models of machine or the laws of nature. Concepts link one to another, a tapestry of meaning—“chair” to “table,” “table” to “wooden,” each connected by the invisible threads of understanding.",
            "In the year 2007, the United States of America found itself mired in a financial tempest that swept the land with an unforgiving hand. Unemployment rose like a specter in the night, the housing market crumbled into dust, and the great monoliths of American enterprise lay shattered in their own ruin. This recession, a specter that haunts the present, demands that we ask: what conspired to bring about this calamity, and what must be done to stave off such dark tides? In the starkest of terms, the crisis was birthed from the loins of selfish and myopic political maneuverings that coerced banks and enterprises to cast sub-prime loans into an already faltering and unsteady financial edifice. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not free from the yoke, forced to underwrite and reforge these mortgages into constructs of collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. When the borrowers faltered under the weight of their debts, the banks, bereft of capital reserves, transferred this chaos onto the repackaged mortgages they had pawned off, cascading the turmoil through the sinews of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this financial maelstrom can be traced back to the twilight of the millennium, in 1999, during the Clinton era. The President, in his quest for a second tenure, sought to bolster his standing among the populace. In pursuit of this aim, the Clinton administration unshackled lending restrictions, setting the stage for the impending sub-prime debacle that would unfold seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times bore witness to these machinations in 1999, chronicling that Fannie Mae, the nation's foremost underwriter of home mortgages, was under mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to extend mortgage loans to those of lesser means, all while appeasing shareholders with promises of ever-growing profits. Holmes, with a prophet's foresight, discerned the harbinger of doom: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" And as the introduction has laid bare, and as Holmes foretold, reckless lending was to be the harbinger of the economy's unraveling.\n\nA confluence of forces converged to hurl the economy into chaos, not least of which was the novel and intricate design of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations were wielded with reckless abandon in the years preceding the crisis, serving only to bind more threads of the economy to the fate of the housing market. This left American households, and the financial markets writ large, overextended and perilously susceptible to even the minutest tremors in home prices.\n\nInevitably, the housing bubble burst, and the financial strongholds that had embraced these mortgage-backed securities found themselves betrayed. The five titans of U.S. investment banks collectively bore $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts by 2007, a sum that comprised nearly a third of the nation's GDP. In the end, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were relinquished for a pittance, Lehman Brothers disintegrated into the void, and Goldman Sachs along with Morgan Stanley were compelled to transform into commercial banks, shackled by stringent regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened under $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were subsumed under government control by September of 2008.",
            "Exposition. That stretch of narrative where a writer unfurls their wings, casting spells of prose to captivate or to lull into the gentle embrace of oblivion. A place where the audience may drift to sleep or retreat from the story's embrace with curses upon their lips. Dr. Merlin, in her encounters with an excess of information, has been known to rail at her screen, bereft of the fun such indulgence might offer.\n\nExposition is a shadow that trails your every move.\n\nThose who read with care know the old adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in the webs of narration where nothing stirs, or where chaos reigns unchecked. Exposition is the whispering imp on your shoulder, urging you to lay bare the past so the tale may find its path, not to be mistaken for the other imp, which entices you to unfurl the entirety of a character's youth.\n\nExposition is the recounting of the past, often in stark prose. In the realm of film, it unfurls when one soul shares with another a torrent of knowledge akin to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In the written word, it is the author's voice that weaves this tapestry.\n\nConsider this: as you traverse a tale, you learn of a heroine who met her love in a time and place, of their grand union, and of the grim fate that befell her husband before her eyes. You would not foresee such a profound story to be confined to mere pages where their voices are but whispers in the wind. You would seek the depth of the husband's soul, revealed in his words and deeds, to understand the breadth of his love for her. Equally, the heroine's heart would be laid bare, her life enriched by his presence, and you would desire the author to paint her journey with vivid strokes, to feel the weight of her loss, drawing you deeper into her world.\n\nYou yearn for substance upon the bare bones of the tale: \"They met, they wed, he perished.\"\n\nAs a storyteller, you must provide that substance. (*glances at metaphor, resigns, presses on*) There is a pull to hasten through certain passages. Perhaps you introduce a new figure, a former Air Force man, now the night guardian of a gas station, twice wed with no offspring, who spends his weekends casting lines into waters, dreaming of owning the very place he tends, and who savored Eggs Benedict at dawn.",
            "I watched the broadcasts come flickering from Columbus, Ohio, and the first of them from NBC 4 on a morning that seemed reluctant to dawn, August 13, 2011. The lead story spun a dark tale from Ashley, Ohio, where a man by the name of Shad Hostettler had taken a knife to his wife, though her name remained wrapped in silence. His visage appeared on the screen, and in his eyes, there was something of the devil's own making. The story, raw and bleeding, was given but two minutes' breath, the scant details laid bare: multiple stabbings, arrest made. A fitting brevity, I reckoned.\n\nNext came the lament of a young man, Travis Buyers, all of eighteen years, felled by gunfire in the shadows of Sharon Woods. Critically injured and no hand of justice yet laid upon a suspect. The SWAT team prowled the scene, but the tale was cut short—perhaps, I thought, because he was from a neighborhood where skin was darker and voices oft unheard. I've long seen how the media's gaze skims lightly over the tragedies of minorities, while the plight of a missing or harmed white child or adult sends them into frenzied cries.\n\nThen came word of a gunshot wound in a Med-Flight helicopter, the bullet's path traced to a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers dangled a five-thousand dollar reward like bait to catch the shadowed shooter.\n\nThe weather turned the narrative next, with rain and thunderstorms looming in the Saturday sky, temperatures to hover in the eighties. The forecast was a mere whisper, a siren call to keep eyes glued to the screen.\n\nA robbery followed, from a UDF on Clime Road, a dark-skinned man in a hoodie casting his shadow over the store. Six feet tall, a lean one hundred and fifty pounds, they said, the color of his skin given undue weight in the telling, like a stone in a small child's pocket.\n\nLastly, the tale of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas Drug-Kingpin, convicted in the trade of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. They spoke of his sentence not in years but in months, three hundred of them, a curious twist perhaps meant to sharpen the sting. Hispanic, they called him, a detail that seemed to bear no real weight in the matter.",
            "In the vast expanse of the financial wilderness, where numbers sway like the tall grass in the prairie, there exists a curious thing known as an ETF, an exchange traded fund. This peculiar entity shadows an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund, yet it bears the markings of flexibility, trading in the open like a lone stock on the plains. The ETF offers the breadth of an index fund combined with the singularity of stock ownership. It allows a man to sell short, to buy on margin, to claim even a single share, and all this with the expense ratios that lay lower than the average mutual fund, like the sun sinking beneath the horizon.\n\nYet, not without its drawbacks, for in this land of promise a commission must be paid on any trade, as if one bartered for cattle or land. The bounty of ETFs lies in their vast variety, and while these benefits shine like the morning sun, the prudent investor must question their existence and measure their reach. Thus, the task falls upon us to examine the ETF known as IHF, to weigh it against the ten mighty holdings that form its backbone, and to discern if the singular ETF stands as tall as a diversified portfolio of those ten stocks. We seek to know if these holdings could be arranged in a manner more advantageous, yielding a sharper ratio or better return.\n\nAmidst this endeavor, we select only the top ten holdings, those that account for 63.58% of the ETF's wealth, for to include all would be a burden too great. These ten hold a tale of their own, each with a percentage of the assets they guard. To understand how these ten reflect the ETF IHF, we must use their current assets, normalized to a perfect hundred, to calculate their weight upon a portfolio's Beta and Return, as if the portfolio were constructed solely from these ten in accordance with the ETF's design. The chart of calculations lies before us, a testament to their worth.\n\nFrom this chart, it is clear as the mountain stream that a portfolio of the top ten rises with a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, a climb of 16% in returns. The Beta of these ten stands .12 lower than the ETF in its entirety. It seems a portfolio of these ten could offer greater return with less risk, but the winds of chance whisper that their means may not differ in truth. To measure this, we turn to the standard deviation of each stock, normalized to the perfect hundred, to compare their collective deviation against the ETF IHF's own.\n\nAnd so the journey continues, the numbers like the stars in the night sky, guiding us onward through the vast landscape of finance.",
            "When you look back upon Figure 17, you see how in the third month the number of commuter logs dropped like a stone in a well. It was a sight to make a man ponder on the ways of the world. Why it happened, no one could rightly say. Winter grips the New England campus, and with it comes the reluctance of folks to brave the cold on bicycle or foot, which might explain a portion of the fall. December is the time when the semester closes its weary eyes and students and faculty alike drown in the tides of final work and grades. The commuter log, once a priority, finds itself forgotten, adrift on a sea of pressing matters. Then the holidays come, sweeping all before them, and the campus grows silent with the absence of its people. Classes awaken again in the latter days of January, yet still February logs remain scarce, a mystery unsolved. Perhaps such projects burn bright at the start, only to wane as the novelty fades. To counter such decline, we set forth the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a call to arms that saw logs rise once more. The struggle to keep the project's heart beating was a lesson in overcoming the quiet pull of holiday and semester breaks in the academic world.\n\nAnother obstacle stood, as solid as the mountains, in the love people bear for their cars, the freedom and independence they represent. It's a love rooted deep in the soil of our culture, and to turn people from it requires more than mere words. We offered incentives, prizes to tempt them from their paths: gift certificates to local haunts, the promise of a meal or a warm drink, a massage or a book. But what if the prizes had been grander? A bicycle, a hybrid, or even an electric car? Such offerings might have sparked the interest anew, luring them back to the fold. The nature of the prizes remained constant, a steady note in the project’s song. Yet had we announced, come December, the chance of a bicycle, and in January the lure of a car, perhaps then the engagement would have grown rather than dwindled. It is a thought to stir the imagination, what might have been.",
            "In the dim corridors of the Library of Congress where the ghosts of early cinema whisper, I found myself drawn to the flickering shadows of Edison’s trick films. Fifteen of these spectral reels span the years 1895 to 1901, each one a conjuration of illusion wrought by the alchemy of early editing. My study was a meditation on the poetics of these celluloid phantasms and a dissection of the evolutionary aberrations that emerged in their latter days. At the dawn of the century, these films were as bound to their stages as a moth to the flame, their worlds contained within the rigid confines of a frontal proscenium. The camera, unyielding and static, captured long and medium shots with the fidelity of a solemn witness. Each film a singular breath, one shot, one film.\n\nYet, as the century turned, a few bold visions dared to fracture this orthodoxy, introducing the radical notion of multiple shots. Still, most adhered to the stage-bound artifice, the camera never straying from its steadfast post to follow the actors’ steps. This immobility, a vestige of theatre and vaudeville, shackled the figures to a lateral dance, side-to-side, never towards the lens. Consider Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right, tracing a path along the horizontal axis, the camera unmoving, a dispassionate observer as they vanish beyond the frame.\n\nThe proscenium's grip dictated the use of long shots, with medium shots a mere whisper and close-ups an unheard plea. The frames echoed the theatre's grandeur, where the audience's eye embraced the entirety of the spectacle, bounded by the stage’s borders. Actors remained in the midground tableau, close-ups forsaken in the dawn of film.\n\nThese early trick films bore the constraint of a single shot as their narrative vessel, a limitation that confined their length to a minute or less, dictated by the clockwork of frames per second. Their tales were brief and wondrous, vaudeville's magic acts captured with little narrative ambition. Yet, the illusion was a clever deceit, for what seemed a single shot was often a tapestry of many, woven together to conjure apparitions and vanishings. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), the illusion fractures under scrutiny, revealing the seam where Mary's spectral head is severed from her body. Though to the viewer's eye, it remains a singular, haunting vision.",
            "In the gatherings of shadowed halls and timeworn spires, the Gothic Novel stands as a contradiction of old and new, a literary oxymoron as Ian Watt notes in his chronicles of its ascent. This Gothic form, maligned and exalted in equal measure, has been accused of lacking depth even as it conjures the 'terrible sublime' that Burke would speak of in hushed tones. The birth of this literary specter traces back to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a conjuring of both ancient and modern romance to forge a new path through the world of letters. Walpole, with a craftsman’s eye, wove together the old theatrics and the mimicry of nature that the modern novel offered, and in this alchemy, he penned what he would call \"A Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic genre is a tapestry woven from the threads of medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even as The Castle of Otranto met the world, the word \"Gothic\" bore the weight of many meanings, stretching across peoples, styles, and ages. It seemed a relic, unsophisticated in the harsh gaze of modernity's march. Yet it was this very mingling of the theatrical and the novel's new form, with its gaze into the heart of its characters, that let the Gothic endure, ever ancient yet forever new to eyes far removed from its birth.\n\nAmong the shadows of Gothic thought, the specter of Chivalry walks, a relic of medieval honor and the knightly path. In The Castle of Otranto, this old chivalric code is both preserved and transformed. For Gothic scribes, the idea of chivalry held a sacred importance—it evoked the noble knight, steadfast and true, a stark contrast to the absence of such ideals they perceived around them. Through these chivalric echoes, the Gothic past became a canvas of idealization, a hint of Romanticism yet to come, an attempt to cast a light upon the present’s shadows. Walpole, amidst the turmoil of his times, despaired at the world’s trajectory. Engulfed by the political storm and its accusations, he may have pondered the loss of the Gothic era's moral compass within the hearts of his contemporaries. This musing finds a face in Frederic, a character hewn from the stone of chivalric tradition.\n\nFrederic's tale is told before his entry, painted in images of chivalry. A prince once, his life marked by suffering and tragedy, lost to the world by infidel hands. In Frederic, the gallant knight takes form, an image stretched to the edge of excess, heralding the Gothic penchant for the grandiose.",
            "In the dim recesses of industry, where the hum of machinery echoes like a distant thunder, there lies the intricate dance of supply chain management. It's a procession, from the moment a customer’s desire is whispered into the ether, through the raw, unformed materials, till the goods are birthed, handed over from one unseen hand to another, till they reach that final resting place in the consumer’s grasp. This notion, this orchestration of movement and time, was laid forth in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver, who envisioned the path of goods as a tapestry woven with intent, planning, and control, all to meet the whims of want in a manner swift and sure. Six pillars uphold this edifice: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and the ghostly strands of information that tie them all.\n\nThe forge of production sits at the heart of this process, the molten core from which all else flows. It is here that the when and why and where and how are etched into the stone of intent. The managers, those stewards of commerce, peer into the market, that roiling sea of demand, to glean the desires of the masses. They chart their course, deciding what shall be made and in what measure, choosing the ground where these things shall spring into being, ever mindful of the twin gods of volume and quality, and the needful satisfaction of those who await. And once the place is set, the gears of scheduling turn, the machines are tended, for in the minutiae lies the salvation or the downfall of the enterprise. Missteps here are costly, and the reckoning comes swift. In my own wanderings through the labyrinthine aisles of Wal-Mart and Target, I have seen the doctrine laid bare—a uniformity in attire, a precision in the reception of goods, a testament to the power of outlined processes to stave off the chaos that ever lurks at the edges.\n\nSupply, the second pillar, stands in the shadow of production, casting its own light upon the path. It is the art of choosing, of deciding which capabilities to cultivate within the walls of the facility and which to entrust to the hands of others. A single product may be born in many places, each division a cog in the greater machine, each with its own tools, its own people, its own craft. The manager’s eye must discern which piece fits where, or if the work shall be cast out to others, to partners in this grand endeavor. For in outsourcing lies the promise of velocity—the speed and grace to provide what is needed, when it is needed, without the burden of excessive cost. And so the dance continues, a delicate balance of power and trust, the symphony of supply chain management ever playing to the tune of demand.",
            "Victorian novels, with their ornate tapestries of detail and their unyielding gaze upon the aristocracy, chart a course through the history of an age. Yet from amidst this grand procession emerge two tales that wander from the well-trodden path: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels, with their enigmatic mysteries and the strange, bewildering turns of the bizarre, carve out a realm where characters are not merely drawn but etched deep, their motives and hearts laid bare under the scrutiny of shadows and dreams.\n\nAnd in that shadowed world, Oliver, beset by visions, walks again with the specters of Sikes and Crackit. Their quarrels echo in his mind, a relentless clamor, even as he finds himself speaking to them in the solitude of his thoughts. The sudden crack of gunfire seizes him, cries and shouts erupting as though the very night itself had awakened. Lights flash before his eyes, chaos surrounds him, and some unseen force sweeps him away. Through this tumult, there persists a constant ache, a torment that gnaws at him with an unyielding hunger.\n\nIn these novels, the dreams and visions serve as portals to inner truths, each one a revelation of the soul's hidden landscape. In Oliver Twist, the strange visions tear at the veil of the ordinary, exposing the raw nerves of Oliver's existence. As he relives the shooting in the depths of his mind, the scene unfolds with dreamlike clarity, a testament to his powerlessness against the forces that shape his fate. The hands that bear him away are unseen, the pain an ever-present specter, now entwined with fear rather than shrouded in the numbness of shock. The question looms large: whose design has wrought this suffering upon him? For it is not of his own making. This episode underscores the futility of Oliver's struggle for agency, even as his very life hangs by a thread. The specter of defeat hovers over him, as if old Fagin's shadow had begun to creep into his soul, urging him to surrender to despair, to abandon the fight. Yet somewhere within, a flicker remains, a quiet defiance that refuses to be entirely extinguished.\n\nThe day passed off—day! There was no day; it vanished as swiftly as it came—and night descended once more, a night endless in its dreadful hush, fleeting in its swift passage of hours.",
            "Years back, I found myself in the halls and classrooms of an after school refuge, a place where young minds, elementary and eager, came to wrestle with their lessons. My own inclinations lay in the labyrinth of language, English and the written word my favored realms. It was there that a teacher sought my aid for a boy named Adrian, a lad of perhaps eight or nine years, adrift in the sea of letters. His struggle, it seemed, was not with the words themselves but with the very symbols that made them. Some letters he grasped as if by instinct, others eluded him entirely, a dance of comprehension and confusion. He was Latino, of that there was no question, yet his English was flawless, untainted by any accent. We battled onward, he and I, until the day his mother darkened the doorway. I was watching over the few left behind, when she arrived, her speech a cascade of Spanish, a tongue I barely managed to navigate. But in those halting exchanges, the truth fell upon me with the weight of a revelation: Adrian's battle was with the alphabet itself, not the reading. Whether this epiphany served him well, I cannot say, but in my heart, I hope he found his way.\n\nI recount this tale to illuminate the chasm of language that looms in our schools, a chasm deepened here in the lands of California. It serves to remind that the barriers are not always where we expect them. A child may speak the language of his peers with ease yet find the page an insurmountable wall. This is a truth we must reckon with. So, what is to be done? In Adrian's case, the answer lay in the simple act of tutoring, a focus on the letters and their sounds. Yet for those whose tongues are not yet shaped by English, the path is fraught with complexity. There is no single remedy. The dual language system, the immersion, the tutors, the ESL classes, each a tool, none a cure by itself. The answer lies in their union.\n\nThe dual language path is a worthy venture, not merely for the children of Spanish tongues, but for all. Studies speak of children in bilingual programs surpassing their peers, an achievement not confined to the few. Fear lingers, a specter of wasted effort, a belief that most gain nothing. But this is a falsehood. Make these programs the standard, not the exception, and all will rise. Yet, how to achieve this? Must we demand our teachers speak in two tongues? No, such a demand is folly. But there is no reason we cannot bring forth a cadre of aides, tutors, call them what you will, who bridge this gap with their bilingual voices.",
            "From the first whispers of consciousness we are told of a force greater than ourselves, vast and unknowable. Some are led to chapels and others to synagogues, while others seek within the silence of their own hearts. We are handed down the faiths of our fathers and many accept them without question, yet there are those who turn away, dismissing the unseen in their self-centered world. In the course of our lives, we may embrace one creed and later cast it aside for another. We walk various paths, each seeking to understand our place in the cosmos through the lens of our own spiritual perceptions. In the shadows, we search for a light to guide us to the dawn.\n\nA cardinal, my father said when I inquired of his favored bird. We sat on the porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof above, sharing cigarettes. The water poured from the gutters, drowning the plants that clung to the edge of the porch. His eyes were fixed on the rain, lost in a gaze that seemed to see beyond the present. He had grown gaunt these past months, his clothes hanging loose as if they belonged to another man. His hair had thinned, a sparse memory of what once was. Still, he stared into the rain, never meeting my eyes. I felt the solitude between us, the fear of speaking the words that would make real what we both knew. I embraced him, then settled back, drawing my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the dim light of June’s end.\n\nHe left this world that December, five days past my twenty-second year. The poison and the fire of treatment had not lessened his pain, but only stretched his days beyond the doctors’ reckonings; what worth in such prolonged suffering I could not say. I questioned the nature of a God who would allow such cruelty. Alone in the darkness, I found no prayers left in me. If there was a God, I felt he had turned his ear from me long ago.\n\nI could not bear witness to his passing from this life. I chose not to. I wished to remember him in life, not in the shadow of death. I knew him, perhaps better than any, and knew he would not want me there in those final moments. So I lay curled in my bed for three days, waiting for the news that never came.\n\nNo one thought to call.",
            "In the rolling fields of Caroline where the soil lay dark and fertile, there stood a man named John Taylor, who with the fervor of a prophet, championed the cause of Republicanism. A farmer by trade, yet his voice echoed in the chambers of power, a testament to his fervent belief in the liberty of men and the restraint of government. His conviction in the agrarian way colored every word he spoke on sovereignty, on the sanctity of the Constitution, and even upon the courts of law.\n\nJohn Taylor saw in the young nation of the United States a canvas unspoiled, unblemished by the burdens of old traditions. Here was a land where men could craft with their own hands a government of self-rule. He held fast to the natural rights of man, these rights entwined like the roots of old trees, so that in denying one, the whole would wither. Such rights, he declared, must remain out of the grasp of any mortal government. In the brutish state of nature, it was the strong of arm and dark of mind who thrived, but within the bounds of civilization, such must not be.\n\nTo forge this society, Taylor said, the government must reckon with the dual nature of man, his capacity for both good and evil. His creed was simple, yet stern, that all virtues and vices of governance were but reflections of human nature. Good principles, he claimed, were those that safeguarded private land, nurtured the crops that sprang from it, and turned away from the lure of unchecked commerce. A government rooted in such principles would stand fair, despite the inevitable sway of those who lead with greed. Self-interest, he mused, drives all men, yet it turns foul when it births enclaves that flourish at the cost of others. A vigilant government was needed to keep man's darker instincts in check, ever wary of the creeping shadow of ill principles.\n\nAmong the chorus of Republican voices, Taylor's was steadfast, calling for a Constitution held tight to its written word. He envisioned a Federal government constrained, with powers no greater than those written clear upon the parchment. An expansive government meant an expensive one, and he saw in that the seeds of tyranny. Yet he warned against a mere literal reading of the text, for without the light of the framers' intent, corruption could easily take root. To Taylor, the Declaration of Independence was the true heart of the nation, a testament not to a singular entity, but to a union of sovereign states, each with its own soul.",
            "The world lay still before me, a tableau untouched by time, and I gazed upon it with a mind as unyielding and indifferent as the earth itself. No tether to abstraction disturbed my view, no whisper of understanding, for mine was a study of the visible and nothing beyond. Thoughts drifted like ghosts, ephemeral and unclaimed, the mind a smooth stone upon which the stream of perception flowed, untroubled and clear.\n\nOnce, at the urging of an artist I’d known, I procured a book, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I’d longed to draw since boyhood, six years tender and yearning for the secrets held in a pencil's line. The book promised to reveal all, from the mystery of graphite to the alchemy of perception. It taught, among other things, the framing of a picture, to distill chaos into clarity—a bowl of fruit on a table, a universe contained within a frame.\n\nYet there, before the bowl, I stood unable to conjure such a frame. Overwhelmed I was, awestruck and silent. The greats had their phases and palettes—Picasso his blue, Monet his green, the masters their prismed hues. And here I stood, at the dawn of my own work, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers found the instrument of my art, muscles taut and obedient, and the air parted as my will became form. Water danced, clear and sure, flecks of existence surrendered to the void. Muscles clenched again, more insistent, and the hand drove the handle down. Still, the brown mass clung stubbornly, an unwelcome guest in porcelain confines.\n\nWith mop in hand, stance firm, and a tie strangling my neck, I surveyed the crude testament left behind in the Rite Aid restroom. Flush after futile flush, and moments of quiet reflection passed, until I reached for the paper, a makeshift gauntlet forming around my hand. Straightening, then bending, I plunged into the bowl, a mother reclaiming her Thanksgiving fowl...",
            "The roads become a battleground where the young meet their end, their lives snuffed out behind the wheel. There's a confluence of factors that shape this grim ledger of statistics for the youngest of drivers in America. The National Institutes of Health speak of the adolescent mind, unripe and unready for the perils of the open road. Inexperience, too, stands at the core, a silent specter leading them to their doom. It is this lack of experience that not only brings about fatal collisions but an increase in vehicles overturned, a reckless speed, and the veering off into oblivion.\n\nWhen they gather with their kin, the outcome is far more dire, a truth evident to any soul with a shred of sense, for these young riders often travel in packs. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center reveals a stark correlation: the age of those riding alongside and the frequency of wrecks upon the road.\n\nIn places like California, the law seeks to shield these fledgling drivers by imposing provisional licenses that curtail their hours and banish other young passengers from their company. Yet these provisional measures are but a patch upon a greater wound. The truth is plain: these youngest among us, by any measure of statistics, are ill-prepared to shoulder the weight of the wheel. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman holds that even eighteen is too tender an age for the granting of a full license. USA Today bears witness to his findings, revealing a penchant in those not yet twenty to court danger for the heady rush it imparts. It stands to reason then, to defer the granting of this privilege until the fever of thrill-seeking begins to wane. If we persist in bestowing licenses upon these young souls, the carnage will not cease; the death toll shall swell to unthinkable numbers in the coming years. As the children of the Baby Boomers come of age to drive, millions more will take to the highways.\n\nThe crafting of laws to address this need not be a complex affair. Schools might continue the instruction of driving to prepare those who will one day take the wheel, yet none younger than eighteen ought to command a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be given in the time before a full license is awarded, with practical training hours mandated. The number of hours might mirror what states currently require; in California, six hours of wheel-time and fifty in the company of an elder. Given the deadly data drawn from across the nation, a uniform law to guard young drivers would be a reasonable—and I dare say effective—step in securing the safety of our youth.\n\nSuch legislation is not a novel concept, but one of necessity and sense.",
            "In the quiet corridors of the mind's vast expanse, where shadows whisper and echoes linger, there lies a disorder by the name of Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, a malady not of the ears but of the soul's perception. It is here that we begin, unfolding the tale of a brain's struggle to make sense of the sounds that dance around it. First, we must define this affliction, and then, we shall peer into the means by which it is known, marked by signs and signals like distant smoke on the horizon. Lastly, we turn our gaze to the classrooms, where teachers, like weary sentinels, seek to guide those beset by CAPD through the fog of misunderstanding.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder as some have called it, speaks to the enigma of the central nervous system's dance with the auditory world. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, in their wisdom of 2005, spoke of it as the CNS's art of utilizing sound, where the fault lies not in hearing but in the alchemy of translation. The ears hear, yet the mind falters, unable to separate the song from the silence, the voice from the void.\n\nIn the annals of history, its earliest echoes resound from the mid-1950s, cloaked in the name of 'auditory imperception.' It was then that pioneers such as Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began their work, crafting tests in the year 1954. Kimura, in 1961, brought forth dichotic testing, weaving a model to unveil the mysteries of the central auditory nervous system. A gathering of minds in 1977 kindled the fires of inquiry into the children who bore this burden.\n\nCAPD reveals itself in myriad forms, a specter of sound and silence. The afflicted may wander through the world unable to discern sound's origin, or fail to tell one noise from another. Patterns of sound elude them, and the cadence of speech, with its subtle shifts, remains a riddle. The past sound is swallowed by the present, and the clues that others weave into meaning are lost upon them, as is the sequence of auditory events.\n\nTo diagnose this specter, one must embark on a journey of observation, through the systematic witnessing of listening and the trials of auditory function. Audiologists, SLPs, and psychologists are the seekers, wielding questionnaires and surveys, their eyes keen upon the behavior of the listener. Yet, no single test holds the key, no cause is known, and the path to understanding remains shrouded. Tests present a cacophony, asking of the listener a deciphering of words and numbers, while others delve deeper, recording the responses within the ear's hidden chambers.\n\nIn the end, CAPD is a silent struggle, a battle waged within, where the ears are but the gatekeepers to a mind that seeks to understand the world it hears, yet finds itself lost amidst the echoes.",
            "In the pursuit of an education in social work, my path leads toward the Division of Family and Children Services, a road marked by the desire to mend what has been broken, to shield the young who have known only neglect or abuse, and to offer a hand to families adrift in the storm. The values I carry into this field are more than mere words; they are the bricks and mortar of my being—service, respect, an unwavering ethical compass, a commitment to better the bonds between people, and a relentless drive to hone my skills so that I remain ever worthy of the task. These values are not solely the province of the social worker; they are the quiet truth of who I am.\n\nFrom my earliest days, the longing to aid others was a constant companion, though the road ahead lay obscured by shadows. High school and college unfolded before me, a parade of souls fleeing from their own shadows, some stumbling into the arms of poor solace. Witness to these struggles, I turned my steps toward a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Yet the path remained elusive, and so I paused upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, fate led me to a friend’s home, where a boy of sixteen sat upon her couch, his eyes wide with the fear of one seeking refuge from the cruelties of his own blood. The tale unfolded—an escape from abuse—and the next dawn brought news that he had called the law to stand against his kin. I went to that place where his parents dwelt, seeking to lend aid, and spoke my concerns to the officers who could do little more than listen. They bid me speak with the parents, and I did, the truth of my fresh degree a thin armor as I faced their nervous words, their justifications for what the boy had done. In that moment, the thought took root within me—a calling to the work of healing such \"simple\" disputes.\n\nIn this calling, there is also the fierce heart of social justice. Society proclaims the worth of the individual, yet in its mourning for the lost, it clings to traditions that bind rather than liberate. If we weep for those who pass, why do we shackle ourselves to the sameness of all? I am an individual, and I reject the chains that would make me otherwise. In the halls of high school and college, I raised my voice against the injustices I saw—my hair a palette of defiance, my clothes a banner of self, my ears adorned beyond the ordinary. I stood with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, stood against the specter of racism and discrimination, whenever and wherever they reared their heads. For social justice is my creed, and I shall not cease in my protest against the injustices of this world.",
            "In the dim corridor of human understanding, there lies the restless specter of insomnia, a disorder as ancient as the stars and as confounding as the shifting sands. This paper, like a lone traveler, seeks to unravel the tangled threads of its origins, peering through the lenses of the Biological and Sociocultural models. The biological model casts its gaze upon the bloodlines, the inheritance of genes and the medical tapestry woven through the flesh. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural model turns its eye to the world outside, the interplay of environment, race, and the unyielding march of socioeconomic forces. This review, a journey through the night, examines the chosen research, explaining, critiquing, and laying bare the strengths and weaknesses found therein.\n\nSleep disorders, those silent thieves of the night, come in many forms. They may stand alone as primary disorders or walk hand in hand with the shadows of mental affliction. The Dyssomnias, those guardians of sleep's gate, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, and Narcolepsy, each a tale of its own. Primary Insomnia, a thief of slumber, while Primary Hypersomnia, a struggle to remain awake, both haunting their victims for no less than a month. Narcolepsy, with its sudden descents into the abyss, speaks of cataplexy and the automatic descent into dreams. The Parasomnias, in contrast, are specters of the night, causing nightmares, terrors, and sleepwalking, each a dance of the mind's shadows. The disorders tethered to mental afflictions, linked to the Axis I and Axis II, weave another story. This review lingers on insomnia, a focus upon the biological and sociocultural realms.\n\nThe biological model, a study of the codes within us, speaks of genes, heritable whispers, and the physiological web that binds. In the hypothalamus, neurons laced with orexin hold the keys to the kingdom of sleep and wakefulness. Studies with mice, those tiny wanderers of science, reveal GABAB receptors on these neurons, gatekeepers of slumber and alertness. Activation of the GABAA receptor ushers in sleep, while its silence brings forth anxiety and wakefulness. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, lengthens the night's embrace (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings, etched in the annals of research, suggest that the mice's tale may echo in the human heart. The genetic and environmental underpinnings of the GABAB receptor unveil a truth: its absence or malfunction may render sleep elusive. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is passed down, it may cast a shadow over life's endeavors, dimming the prospects of learning, work, and the daily grind of existence. And so, the study of insomnia, a journey through the darkness, seeks to illuminate the path forward.",
            "I've roamed these grounds at University Park for nigh on two and a half years now. The corridors of time marked by four and a half semesters. For many and myself among them, the labyrinth of campus is a trial. My first year saw me nestled in an East Halls dormitory, perched at the easternmost edge of this scholar's domain, save for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center's vastness. From my quarters in Stuart Hall to the distant precincts of Willard building, a pilgrimage to the heart of campus demanded twenty-five minutes or more, a journey aggravated by the whims of State College weather. In conversation with an alumnus, a soul not much older than myself, I gleaned tales of yore when East Halls stood apart, isolated by fields of barren earth. Now the void is filled, sports fields and colossal structures like the new Creamery and health services building rising up, apartments encircling them. As the campus sprawls ever outward, the burden of distance grows heavier. How best to traverse this widening expanse? The answer lies in the bicycle. Yet the bicycle alone is but half the battle. Riders must mount them, and the paths must welcome their wheels.\n\nI spoke with a friend, one who had recently returned to the saddle after years away. He pondered aloud why he ever dismounted. \"Bikes are grand,\" he declared. \"Once, it wasn't the fashion to ride, but it's the only way to roam.\" Beyond fortifying the body, the bicycle is a paragon of efficiency. A humble bowl of oatmeal and the turn of a pedal can carry you thirty miles or more. Like many a student, I've taken residence off campus, distances akin to those dormitories. The wisest choice I've made this year was to acquire a bike. Each day, my path leads to Thomas building, a place that demands twenty-five minutes on foot from my door. A bicycle reduces that time to five, if I am swift and the road favors me. Yet the straightforward path of Pollock Road is fraught, a challenge whether mounted or on foot. There are merits in walking, but time is a luxury I do not possess. Without my bike, walking would be my sole recourse, a drain of thirty to forty minutes each day. Hours lost each week, time I cannot afford to squander.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dark vision of a world remade by the hands of men, he lays bare the creeping machinations of technology and the relentless march of capitalism, crafting a realm where the soul is subjugated to the whims of the machine. This brave new world, a place where the collective voice drowns out the solitary whisper, molds its people from birth to seek only the fleeting balm of immediate pleasure. Within this tapestry, the citizens are revealed as mere pieces in a grandiose game, their minds shackled to the dictates of the World Controller. Through the lens of Marxist thought, one glimpses Huxley's wary eye cast upon the constructs of his age. The jargon of Marxism—homogeny, reification—lurks within the narrative, underscoring the novel's commentary on the flaws of the burgeoning economy that rose around him.\n\nIn this satire of capitalism, the specter of false consciousness looms large. The common folk, blind to the chains that bind them to their economic fates, pursue self-interest in a dance orchestrated by unseen hands. This, the fruit of ideological dominion over the masses, stands starkly in Huxley's world. The Delta, the Gamma, and their ilk, robbed of true volition, are driven by the whispers of hypnopædia to consume, to spend, to indulge. Their strings pulled by the World Controller, who enacts a hegemony over their lives, a dominance where the many unknowingly uphold the very structure that ensnares them. The Alphas and Betas, aware yet silent, save for a few like Bernard who dare to question. In this interplay of castes, the heavy hand of capitalism's perceived oppression is made manifest.\n\nIn Huxley's creation, the bonds between souls are mere shadows. The novel draws no lines to separate its players, for even those who stand in the light are but hollow echoes. Here, he suggests that the rise of the machine and the market strips man of his will, his essence. Love is a ghost, and the peaks of emotion are leveled to the plain. Interactions are but surfaces, the men's talk of women reduced to the pneumatic, the women unabashed in their tales of encounters. The unquestioning acceptance of their place within the hierarchy speaks to the socioeconomic toll of capitalism. Their obedience, their unyielding role in the collective, mirrors the Marxist view of the proletariat, led to believe in their own supremacy so long as they consume, conform, and march in step with their fellows.",
            "It was near four years past when I found myself enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A crucible of debate it was, with the class grappling fiercely over the nature of Islam itself, whether it bore hostility in its heart. The question lingers yet, more pertinent perhaps than it ever was. The shadow of 9/11 cast long, and I watched as the media scape shifted, from a scornful gaze upon Islam and its zealots to a peculiar tolerance within the bounds of America. In the year of 2001, it would have been unthinkable for a man named Barack Obama, whose lineage traced to Muslim roots, to stand as a presidential contender.\n\nThe life of the Prophet stirs my interest, for in it I see a dance of contradictions. The history I’ve known paints Muhammad as a conqueror, wielding the sword to spread the faith among tribes. Yet the biographers pen a different tale, casting him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, drawing followers not by force but by the truth they perceived in his teachings. They came to him, so the story goes, as moths are drawn to flame.\n\nThere are echoes of another ministry, that of Jesus, in this narrative of Muhammad’s wonders. The multiplication of mutton and milk for forty men, a miracle reminiscent of the loaves and fishes. I sense the writers’ intent, to craft an image of a prophet unbothered by proof, instead living a life suffused with truth and miracles. Yet, such a portrayal seems to diminish the singular life of Christ, as though they would borrow glory from one to bestow upon another.\n\nIn the biography’s tales, one sees a pattern, a need to establish witness, to mark the conversion to Islam as a voluntary revelation. But the stories often wend their way through the mouths of others, a hearsay chain of so-and-so heard from so-and-so. It leaves the tales suspect, their truth diluted by the distance of voices.\n\nWhat gnaws at me most is the elevation of Muhammad to a stature of saintly humility and wisdom, a gentle soul. Yet the chronicles of history seem to sing a different song, a discordant tune against this image. I wonder if those who follow Islam today perceive these truths, the history that lies beneath the legend of Muhammad’s ascent.",
            "In the dust of centuries past, the teachings of the Nazarene lay like forgotten stones, left behind by those who sought to build upon them towers of doctrine reaching skyward. In the sweep of history, one sees the faith of Christ drawn ever further from its humble origins, a river swollen and diverted, its course altered by time and the hands of men. The world now turns with a restless awareness, a stirring in the hearts of many toward a horizon not yet seen. Those who cling to the old ways, rooted in tradition, stand steadfast, but their numbers wane, and their voices, though loud, may not carry the weight to halt the tide.\n\nAmidst the faithful, a seed of understanding takes root, a reckoning with the layers laid upon the simple truth long ago. There will be a yearning, a hunger to peel back the years, to strip away the accretions of centuries, and to gaze once more upon the face of the Christ, unadorned and pure. It is a slow turning, a movement that may take the span of lifetimes, but it is inexorable. A great reversal looms on the horizon, a return to the ancient path, a shedding of the burdens of doctrine, down to the bare earth of the man from Galilee.\n\nAs this reversion sweeps across the lands, from the shores of the New World to the old streets of Europe, it will gather the faithful in its wake, drawing them together in a unity of purpose unseen for generations. The church will stand resolute, a shepherd to guide this flock, yet the diversity that once scattered the faithful like seeds upon the wind will coalesce into a singular vision. The distinctions that once divided them—denominations, creeds, and theologies—will blur into a harmony of belief, a testament to the power of a shared journey back to the source.\n\nHistory is a tapestry woven with reversals, a testament to the cycles of human endeavor. The Romans once hunted the followers of Christ, only to later embrace the cross themselves. Our own nation has seen the chains of slavery broken, rising to a place where those once oppressed now lead. And so it will be with this coming reversion, as the faithful seek to unweave the threads of time, to return to the spring from which their faith first flowed. It is a journey that will be guided by a reading of the Nazarene’s words not as rigid law, but as parable and metaphor, a map to guide the soul.\n\nIn the mists of ancient days, before the man from Nazareth walked the dusty roads of Judea, there was only Judaism, the soil from which the new faith would grow. Monotheism, revelation, and the sacred texts of the Hebrews were the bedrock upon which the Romans, in their conquest of Jerusalem, found a people divided—not as one, but in the many faces of Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the nameless multitudes who lived and died by the law. And so, one asks, what has become of this faith since those distant days?",
            "In the gloom of the ironworks and the ceaseless clangor of industry, The Jungle lays bare the raw and unyielding truth of man's nature, a truth steeped in avarice and self-interest. Beneath the facade of civility lies a relentless quest for self-betterment, a pursuit blind to the plight of those who dwell in the shadows below. The tale unfolds within the labyrinthine corridors of the great factories, overseen by owners and managers whose eyes are fixed solely on the expansion of their empires. Their hearts are hardened against the cries of those trampled underfoot, the casualties of their relentless march toward progress. Upton Sinclair's vision is stark, his words painting the sky as a canvas of dark defilement, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" A testament to the disregard these titans hold for all that is caught in their wake, be it man or beast, the smoke rises unceasingly, a harbinger of ruin.\n\nWithin this realm of iron and smoke, the well-being of the laborer is cast aside, a mere afterthought in the ledger of wealth. The men who toil within are cogs in a machine, their lives exchanged for the promise of another dollar. Sinclair's words cut to the bone, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The laborers are driven without mercy, their hours long and their recompense paltry, until the day they are discarded, without warning or recourse, to fend for themselves in a world devoid of safety nets. In this era of unbridled capitalism, laws are but whispers against the gale, and the owners reign unchecked, demanding ever more from their workers who toil under the weight of impossible demands. Though Sinclair's narrative does not voice it outright, the silent expectation is clear: endure the torment, for there is no salvation to be found. No agency offers solace, no hand extends in aid. The unions, conceived as bastions of hope, become yet another cog in the infernal machine, exploiting the very souls they claim to protect. The workers, ensnared in this relentless grind, are likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\" Thus, the cycle turns unbroken, and the cries of the downtrodden echo unanswered into the void.",
            "In the dim corridors of the mind where shadows weave their tales, Poe's \"Dream-Land\" stands, a testament to his own claim of mastery. Here, in the lines that speak of \"Thulé,\" an echo from Virgil rises, whispering of that far island beyond Britain's grasp, the edge of what men dared to know. Virgil's voice indeed calls from the past, yet Poe's gaze wandered further, drawn to the Germanic titans of word. \n\nIn this, the specter of Goethe looms large, for Karl J. Arndt, in his musings on \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" finds mirrors in their verses, a mimicry perhaps, or homage. The Oxford Companion to English Literature speaks of Goethe’s own Faust, a drama of poetic descent, unspooling over the years, its threads concluding in the year Goethe himself found his end, 1832. Within it, a fragment, \"The King of Thulé,\" tells of a monarch whose heart was lost upon a goblet’s gift, his lady gone to the grave. The weight of memory bends him to drink and mourn until he casts his final treasure to the sea's depths and follows it with closed eyes into the abyss.\n\nIn Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" echoes of this king's sorrowful tread can be felt, shadowed reflections of a soul adrift in drink and grief, perhaps a specter of Poe's own losses. Faust's tale found new life in the hands of H P Grattan in '42, mere moons before Poe's own pen inscribed \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nTwice \"Thule\" rings from Poe's collected voice, once in the pit's dark sway, twice in the land of dreams, a refrain that binds the pieces as kin. Within \"Dream-Land,\" the traveler speaks of Thule's desolate expanse, a place where ghosts keep company and color fades to whispers. A land where Goethe's king might wander, burdened by loss and the specter of rule unclaimed, a place where Poe's imagination might find its reflection.\n\nThrough this, Goethe's shadow stretched across Poe's landscape, a presence felt through the tendrils of Tennyson's acclaim. Though the connection is woven by respect and the tides of literary fashion, it is in the echoes and the spaces between words that Poe found Goethe, and in turn, reflected him.",
            "In the sun-drenched land of California, a question arises from the dust and echoes of commerce. Could a soul, wounded by a fall upon spilled applesauce in a grocer's lane, seek the judgment of punitive damages by revealing the store manager's malice? This, because twice he was told of the mess and yet, wrapped in the solitude of supper, let it linger for a half-hour unheeded.\n\nIn the halls of justice, a judge is unlikely to cast aside Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive recompense without due consideration. To weave such a claim, the plaintiff must unfurl evidence that the defendant’s deeds bore a willful and conscious neglect for the likely harm they sowed, and that such deeds were despicable in nature. Palmer might say that Martin should have foreseen the harm of not cleansing the spill, for in the months before her fall, many patrons of D&D had been felled by similar missteps. Knowing this, he still let the spill remain, a testament to his disregard. Her assertion of Martin's despicable nature may falter, yet it stands on the ground that six such slips had occurred in that fateful year, and still, Martin took no steps to ensure his store's safety.\n\nThat day, October 13, 2009, at the hour of five past the meridian, Rich Wayne, in the employ of D&D Markets, approached his overseer, Paul Martin, to speak of an applesauce spill. Martin, steeped in his meal, dismissed the matter, saying he lacked the time for the woes of the customer. Fifteen minutes later, another worker, Mary J. Haddigan, sounded the same alarm, and Martin, unyielding, replied in kind. At the half-hour mark, Jennifer Palmer stepped into the tale, slipping upon the spill, her back grievously hurt. Before Palmer's misfortune, five other such tales had unfolded at D&D in that same year. Now, Palmer seeks due redress for her hurt, both in compensatory and punitive terms, as we ponder the path of a motion to dim the punitive claim’s light.\n\nIn this golden state, one may recover punitive recompense for a breach not born of contract if the defendant wore the mantle of “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010) speaks thus. Malice, the law says, is a deed wrought to harm or, if not so intended, must be “despicable” and done with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). The courts have named a deed malicious when done with eyes wide to the peril it brings, yet the doer, with deliberation, let those perils come, as in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always harbored a yearning, a gnawing hunger that eluded fulfillment. It was a specter that took root around her fourteenth summer, as she waded into the tumult of adolescence, and it lingered still, three years hence, at seventeen. In those years, the amorphous need had coalesced into a desire for companionship rather than possession. Yet no boy stirred her interest. Some had attempted to court her with the clumsiness of youth, drawn by her allure, but all fell short of kindling any spark within her. She wrestled with this enigma, pondering the nature of her peculiar indifference, seeking the source of her anomaly with the earnestness of youth. The years of introspection yielded theories, but none substantial enough to anchor her speculation. And so she moved through her days, a soul adrift in her own quiet inquisition.\n\nHome was a bastion of tranquility. Her parents were gentle souls, their discourse seldom marred by discord. They rarely quarreled, even with their daughter, save for the inevitable clashes with her burgeoning independence and spirited nature. She was the offspring of serenity, yet she injected into their lives a vibrancy that was both a counterpoint and a complement to their calm, endearing herself to all with her genuine warmth.\n\nToday, however, tranquility shattered. As she wandered through the rooms, seeking the elusive muse, a cry pierced the air, sharp and sudden, borne from her mother's lips. Panic surged as she raced to the kitchen, her voice rising in urgent inquiry, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay prone, pain etched on her features, each breath a whispered \"Ow.\" The girl rushed to her side, hand outstretched in a futile attempt to alleviate the hurt. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words tumbled out, compressed by agony, and the daughter knew her mother's suffering was profound. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother gestured, and in that instant, the girl was grateful for the strength she had honed in preparation for such unforeseen trials. She bore her mother to the car, laid her gently in the back, and drove with purpose.\n\nThe hospital loomed, a place of antiseptic odors and fraught with the specter of illness, but she was impervious to its atmosphere, her mind singularly fixated on her mother's plight. She carried her swiftly inside, her voice rising to summon aid, and they came, faces etched with concern, laying her mother upon a rolling bed with practiced haste. They whisked her away to urgent care, leaving the daughter ensconced in a cocoon of anxiety.\n\nHer mother had tumbled from a stepping stool, reaching for a vase ensconced in the highest cabinet.",
            "In the course of this study, the aim was to lay bare the truth that the adherence to what is known as the Mediterranean Diet, or the Med diet, as mirrored in a lofty alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, carries with it a lesser burden of chronic heart disease and stroke and even the grim specter of stroke mortality. The aMed diet stands as a variant of the Med diet, distinguished by a greater presence of plant foods, plant proteins too, casting aside the common potato but embracing fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, a favoring of monounsaturated fats over their saturated brethren, and a turn towards the bounty of the sea in fish, while the consumption of animal products and saturated fats wanes. A moderate measure of alcohol finds its place.\n\nThe chronicles of studies past have drawn forth an inverse association between the Med diet and the specter of death both total and cardiovascular, with interventions revealing the Med diet's prowess over a low-fat regimen, guiding to weight loss and a favorable tilt of the scales in cholesterol in those who carry the weight of obesity. Yet, these studies of old did not cast their gaze upon stroke or the mortality it brings.\n\nThis inquiry delved into the lives of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, their pasts unmarked by cardiovascular disease or diabetes, drawn from the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort woven from 121,700 female nurses across 11 states. Across the span from 1984 to 2004, six times over, an aMed diet score was drawn from the self-reported food frequency questionnaires, instruments crafted to capture the essence of their nutrient intake from the year gone by. A steadfast 95% of nurses remained tethered to this study through the two decades. The FFQs underwent the scrutiny of validation. The shadows of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through the examination of medical and hospital records, autopsies, or the finality of death certificates. Where such records were absent, cases were deemed probable and gathered in, with some 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts thus classified. Measures of body mass index, the smoke of cigarettes, the use of aspirin, the intake of multivitamins, menopausal status, and the postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986 onward, the leisure pursuits of physical activity were noted.\n\nTo quell the capriciousness of random variation and to better capture the essence of long-standing dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were taken, melding together scores from two years past. Adjustments were made to account for the confounders, those beguiling factors that could cloud the truth, by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling became the tool with which to discern the relation between an aMed score and the specter of CHD and stroke, separate models crafted for the fatal and the nonfatal, and for the varied strokes.\n\nGreater fidelity to the Mediterranean way, as captured in a loftier aMed diet score, bore a kinship with a lesser risk of CHD and stroke in women. Across two decades of vigilance, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 strokes, and 1077 deaths by cardiovascular disease, the fatal CHD and strokes alike, were recorded. Those women who stood in the top aMed quintile found themselves at a diminished risk for both CHD and stroke when set against those in the bottom quintile, a relative risk standing at 0.71.",
            "The sign proclaimed that Hitler lives in Burma. Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, stood solitary on a street corner, a piece of cardboard hoisted aloft, the message scrawled in Sharpie, stark against the world. Burma, or Myanmar they call it now, a land under the yoke of a military junta, power seized in the coup of '62. In 2007, they rose, the people, the monks in their saffron robes leading the way, the streets alive with the spirit of a decade-long silence broken. The Saffron Revolution they named it, for the color of the robes, for the monks who dared the junta's wrath. At first, the government turned a blind eye, a charade of peace, but the tide turned red and the monasteries became battlegrounds, soldiers storming through sacred halls. Foreign eyes, the lenses of journalists, they were sought out, silenced. Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, fell on September 27th, 2007, a casualty of witness. Thirteen dead, they say officially, but Colonel Hla Win, who turned against his own, whispers of thousands, of bodies uncounted and unseen.\n\nThis is the world's old song. Tyranny's hand upon the throats of the dissenters, a tale as aged as time itself. The Romans called their emperors divine, chosen by gods to rule with iron fist. In Japan, the emperors walked as gods among men, heralds of prosperity and ritual, and here in our own land, George W. Bush converses with Ted Haggard, a man steering fools under the banner of the Republic Party.\n\nHistory is littered with such shadows. Tiananmen, June 4th, 1989, where the young and the intellectuals and the workers stood against their rulers. The numbers of the dead, a secret held tight by the Chinese government, spoke of a few hundred, but others tell of thousands fallen. Rwanda's blood-soaked earth in the '90s, Hutu against Tutsi, a government and its militia in lockstep, a genocide. And the specter of Hitler's Reich, where the Jewish people were hunted across nations, a dark chapter etched in the annals of time.\n\nThis tale is old, and still, it unfolds.",
            "In the annals of jazz, Duke Ellington stands like a lone figure etched against a forlorn sky, his legacy a testament to the endurance and artistry that shaped his orchestra like the hand of a sculptor upon wet clay. His touch upon the piano keys whispers soft like the wind through the pines, yet as a composer, he weaves tapestries rich and complex, each thread a testament to the talent within his band. He built cathedrals of sound where the soloist roams free, yet he penned with precision, calling upon the unique voices of his players to illuminate the dark corners of his compositions. In this, he crafted a sound that was both singular and vast, a sound where each piece fit into a grand mosaic of innovation and brilliance.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary speaks of Ellington's sound, a sound like no other, citing Creole Love Call, where the voice is wielded as a jazz instrument, a texture and color unburdened by words. This early work stands as a testament to his ability to compliment and elevate the soloist's style, a thread woven throughout his career. It moves slow, deliberate, a twelve bar blues with six choruses:\n\nFirst, a call and response, voice and reeds, the voice smooth as river stones, then rough as the crags of a mountain.\nNext, the muted trumpet sings, stretching the melody with blue notes that hang like twilight.\nThen, a clarinet soars high, the piano beneath it a subtle dance.\nThe full band echoes, brass and reeds answering each other in echoes of the first.\nThe fifth chorus rises, reeds calling high, syncopated brass and rhythm beneath.\nAnd finally, the voice and reeds return, the growl technique transforming the voice into an instrument itself.\n\nEllington's use of voice, a brushstroke of tone color, is a thread that runs through the tapestry of his work. In Hot and Bothered, a year hence, his orchestration is tight, his ear for tone color sharp. There, “Bubber” Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing engage in a call and response as rich as the earth, creating a sound that is both vocal and instrumental. And in It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), these ideas find further expression, as Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody, a cornerstone in the architecture of Ellington's orchestra.",
            "In the slow and relentless march of time, creatures shift and change, molded by forces both seen and unseen. One might wonder why these beings twist and turn upon their path of evolution, what barriers or guides might steer them along their course. The old wisdom of D’Arcy Thompson from the year nineteen and seventeen still whispers its quiet truth, that the heart of nature's forms eludes the grasp of numbers, an enigma yet unsolved. But the age has advanced, and in its wake, men have begun to use the language of mathematics to probe the secrets of the mollusk’s curving shell, through the journey of its life and the long tale of its kind (as pondered by Raup and Stanley in the year nineteen and eighty-one). With this study, we seek to weave together the strands of mathematical modeling and the tangible world of experiment, to uncover the hidden gears and levers that drive the evolution of the Prunum's form.\n\nIn this task, we took to the shadows cast by X-rays upon the shells of Prunum, seeking the lines and curves that tell their story. These we fed to the machine, the one they call CerioShell, born of Stone in nineteen and ninety-five, and from its calculations arose visions of shells that might be, to trace the limits of their potential change. These findings, in concert with the raw observations of nature, aim to cast light upon the great turning of macroevolution in this lineage.\n\nImagine a shell as a passage spiraling through the ages, each turn a whorl upon an unseen axis, the columella its spine. The whorls grow with a mind of their own, and a line, the suture, marks their boundaries. The greatest of these whorls is the last, the body whorl, while the spire rises above, its apex pointing to the heavens, and the base grounding it below. Out of this creation, the creature ventures forth through the aperture, its gateway to the world.\n\nIn viewing these shells, one might gaze from the apex, the base, the aperture, or the opposite side. And to count the whorls, one must see from above, finding the first suture and drawing a line to divide the shell, to reckon each turn from that mark, even to the quarter of a whorl.\n\nConsider the shell as a series of open doors, each a moment in time, as the creature builds its home. The path of the aperture can be traced by the coordinates of its journey, the radius both wide and tall. This trajectory, a story woven in numbers, can be altered by shifting the variables, thus changing the blueprint of the mollusk's creation.",
            "In the sprawling archipelago of Indonesia, the measure of life’s fragile beginnings has stood unmoved these past ten years, a stillness that echoes in the halls of hospitals and the quietude of rural clinics. While the nation strides toward the Millennium’s beckoning goals, meeting the calls for clean water and the sanctity of sanitation, the cries of mothers and the breath of infants tell a different tale. The path to the promised land of health for child and mother remains fraught, the goals set for 2015 a distant mirage. The reasons for this failure lie buried in the bones of a weakened system, a system in need of fortification rather than mere programmatic patchwork.\n\nIn the crowded rooms where life begins, there is now a greater presence of skilled hands, yet the promise is hollow. Seventy-two percent of births boast such attendance, but the skill is oft possessed by those whose hands are bound by tradition, midwives who cannot wield the tools of intervention when the blood flows too freely. The shadow of maternal death looms large, the specter of hemorrhage ever-present. And so the numbers that speak of progress are but whispers in the wind, masking the vast expanse of work yet undone. Meanwhile, the children suffer, their small bodies wracked with illness, and the hands of health professionals grow scarce in the treatment of their fevered sickness. The records of care after birth are fragmented and incomplete, yet they tell enough of a story—a narrative of neglect that spans the nation.\n\nIn the matter of Cesarean births, the statistics are telling, the figures languishing at a meager four percent, a testament to the inequities that divide this land. In the cities, the rate climbs to seven, yet in the remote corners, it falls to two. The disparity in service is a chasm carved by geography and wealth, the cities drawing the lion's share of care while the rural lands are left wanting. And within this division lies another tale of inequity, the chasm between rich and poor, a gap of twenty-seven percent in the use of services. The poor, ever at the margins, find themselves adrift in a sea of costs beyond their means.\n\nAs the nation contemplates its course, the question looms large: how best to mend this fabric of care? Should the focus be sharp and singular, a programmatic spear aimed at the heart of the issue, or should the strengthening of the system be broad and deep, encompassing the full breadth of life’s journey from womb to world? The allure of targeted programs is strong, their objectives clear and results swift. But the siren song comes with a price. To pour resources into one vein of the health sector is to starve another, to draw the lifeblood of human talent to where the money flows quickest, leaving other fields barren. The specter of international funding for HIV/AIDS casts a long shadow over family planning, a lesson in the perils of such a path. And so too, the proliferation of parallel programs breeds a forest of forms and a tangle of red tape, a bureaucracy that serves itself more than those it was meant to aid.",
            "The annals of Popular Music stretch long in the shadows of time, a century's worth of sound and fury that resists confinement in neat little boxes. These sounds, unruly as a wild river, branch into countless tributaries—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and beyond—each spawning a profusion of sub-genres, sub-sub-genres, a tangled web of sonic exploration. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal has, over the past four decades, become a realm of manifold voices. Its expression is raw and unyielding, a tapestry woven from the darker threads of human emotion. This diversity, birthed from the genre's inception, revealed a flexibility that musicians seized upon, crafting sub-genres and further still until the music became a labyrinth of its own making. \n\nAnd now, as we stand amidst the cacophony of heavy metal's evolution, the essence of what defines it seems to blur, absorbed as it is with themes borrowed from other realms of music. Its roots, however, remain, for understanding the sprawling edifice of metal today demands a reckoning with its origins, its nature as a movement transcending mere genre.\n\nMetal is a journey through shadow, a pursuit of the infinite. It is a sound of excess—more bass, more volume, more violence, more spectacle. It is less the primitive beat, more the virtuoso's touch; the musicians are craftsmen, their mastery evident in every note. Metal, unsurprisingly, is a journey often fueled by the mind-altering haze of drugs. In the mid-seventies, a psychedelic tide swept minds to the brink, birthing records that spoke in tongues of madness and otherworldly visions. These qualities, visceral and dark, struck a new chord in the music scene, a scene where much of what was popular dared not tread into such shadowed realms. Successive waves of metal drew from these dark waters, echoing the Romantic Era’s penchant for the visceral and sublime. The darkness runs like a black thread through the lyrics, a staple of the movement, a whisper of the abyss.\n\nConsider, if you will, the song Helter Skelter, the Beatles' own foray into the depths. It is a song that ascends and descends, a reflection of the mind's tumultuous journey under the influence. Some whisper it to be among the first born of Heavy Metal, a response to the Rolling Stones’ own darkened tune. The Beatles, in their rivalry, sought to prove they could summon the heaviness of the Stones, casting this track into the world from the depths of The White Album.",
            "In the years before the surrealists set their dreams to canvas, Henri Rousseau crafted his own visions from the fabric of his soul. The Dream, painted in 1910, stands as a testament not merely to the wonder of lands traversed in dreams but to the yearnings and aspirations that stirred within Rousseau's heart. Here is a woman cast in awe, and here too lies Rousseau, a painter longing for the embrace of recognition and the praise of his peers. From the outset, he was beset by the vexing choice: to mimic the styles that would grant him entry into the hallowed halls of the art world or to forge his own path, unshackled and defiant.\n\nTo lay eyes upon The Dream, one must first know the dreamer himself. Born May 21, 1844, in the shadowed town of Laval in the northwest of France, Rousseau's beginnings were humble. His father, a tinsmith by trade, lived a life of modest means. Rousseau's hands knew no art in his youth, only the labor of a gabelou, a toiler of municipal tolls, though the world knew him falsely as a douanier. In his personal life, tragedy was a constant companion. The death of his wife Clémence, preceded by the loss of eight children, left him with only a daughter, Julia, and a heart heavy with grief. With brush and canvas, Rousseau sought solace, a new dawn in the midst of despair. Unlike his contemporaries who painted the peasantry with romance, Rousseau was of the folk, a dreamer of dreams that echoed the common man's heart.\n\nTo yearn for acceptance is a human thing, and given his journey, Rousseau's fervent desire to be embraced by the art world is understandable. Untrained, commencing his true calling late, he labored in the shadow of giants. Recognition came slowly, only as Matisse was carving his own niche. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon speaks of the two as rivals yet not, their purposes diverging. Matisse, a man driven by the fear of banality, while Rousseau's wish was to paint with such convention that he might be welcomed into the Artiste Français. Yet in that desire lay the paradox of his existence.",
            "In the quiet corridors of thought where the world’s thinkers have often wandered, there lies a tether binding ethics to aesthetics, truth to beauty. At the core of it all, there is a reason, something elemental. Keats, with his Grecian urn, whispers to us that beauty is truth and truth beauty. That alone is the knowing granted to us in this world. Our journey through life imparts knowledge through the rigors of education or the trials of experience, yet there are things deeper still, understood without instruction. Ethics and aesthetics, you see, are less commandments than they are whispers of understanding. Our exploration of morality and art seeks not to lay down laws but to uncover the mysteries of what makes art resonate or an action noble.\n\nIn the telling of art’s worth or moral’s measure, the conversation dances around but never quite holds the essence in its grasp. Take da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, a subject of myriad discussions—foreground, background, contrast, and culture. Yet none capture why it stands as art. When asked of a beloved piece, a soul might say, “There’s just something about it,” before delving into critique. Art and morality resist reduction to mere qualities. As O’Connor wisely notes, a story unveils what mere statements cannot. All descriptions of literature leave something transcendent. Ethics, too, shares this nature. Wittgenstein muses that ethics cannot be spoken, for it transcends. It is this ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, that is the true strength of art and morality, forging the link between them.\n\nMorality and art wend their way to us in the realm of the noumenal, as Kant might term it. They touch us in ways that defy full explanation. Literature, especially, bears this bond with the moral. As McKean observes, literature’s distinction lies in its moral quality. Other arts might escape such standards, but literature’s very essence is intertwined with the values of life. Living is entwined with values, and literature matters because it reflects those very values back to us.",
            "In the land of Germany as it stands now, a robust and unified presence lingers. From the shadowed embrace of the Alps in München to the northern reach of Kiel by the Baltic Sea, the cultural tapestry weaves its way through the country. It is felt along the banks of the Rhine in Köln, threading its path to Dresden where the Elbe flows. To see Germany's culture as a singular entity is to overlook the myriad threads that form its history, echoing from tribes long past.\n\nGermania, the cradle of the Germanic soul, holds a name whose roots are tangled in scholarly debate. Tacitus, in his accounts, spoke of the Tungrians, a tribe he claimed once bore the name German before they ventured across the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. It was Julius Caesar who first inscribed “Germanus” in his chronicles of the Gallic Wars, a term lifted from the Gauls to set apart those he had vanquished from those who stood unconquered, the latter crossing the Rhine with a mischievous intent. Some, in their conjectures, propose it was a Gaulish word for a neighbor, while others see it as tied to the Germanic spear, the ger, or the Old Irish garim, a shout that marked the Germans as loud and fierce.\n\nTacitus, in his stoic prose, penned “De Origine et situ Germanorum” in AD 98, speaking of a people aboriginal, untouched by the tides of migration. He mused that no man would forsake the fertile lands of Asia or Africa for the harsh terrain and sullen skies of Germania unless it was the call of home. For who in their right mind would leave Rome for such a place? Not the Romans, not then. They sent their armies to the edges of Germania, thirsting for its bounty, yet always they turned back to the sprawling heart of their empire. As the Germanic tribes took form in the first century, they lingered on the empire's periphery, trading and serving among the Roman ranks, their skills honed by the land they called home (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the shroud of disguise wends its way through the soul’s corridors, a tool both cunning and perilous. This masquerade, crafted to deceive, must ultimately be cast off, lest the wearer be consumed by its shadow, leaving only echoes of identity behind. The unraveling of deception bears its own burden—alienation, a severing of bonds once held dear. Thus, one stands at a crossroads, the heart torn between the sanctity of self and the fragile tapestry of human connection. For while some may look upon the ruse with indifference, others shall find offense in the unmasking, their trust shattered like glass upon the stones.\n\nThe intricate dance of deception twines with the reversal of gender roles, raising questions that linger like specters in the mind's recesses. Chief among them is the bewildering query: why? What compels one to forsake their own visage and don the garb of another gender? Viola's plight answers with the voice of survival: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). In lands unknown, Viola cloaks herself in masculinity to stave off danger, her guise a shield against the world’s brute forces. Yet this guise estranges her from the womenfolk, severing her from their solace and strength. Her deception, so artfully wrought, ensnares Olivia in a web of confusion, blurring the lines between Cesario and Sebastian, leading to a love misplaced: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). And still, she carries the weight of unspoken ardor, a flame flickering between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nIn this tangled skein, Twelfth Night speaks to the modern soul, revealing how deceit may unlock the heart’s hidden chambers, drawing forth desires long buried. The shadows of Olivia and Orsino’s hearts suggest yearnings unspoken, desires unbidden, brought to light by Viola’s masquerade. Does Olivia’s heart lean toward Cesario for the semblance of manhood, or does it whisper of a deeper truth, a love for women that dares not speak its name? Yet, it seems more likely that Olivia mirrors the follies of her time, where judgment clings to the surface, to the fleeting beauty of countenance. Her swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, her embrace of Cesario/Viola as kin rather than lover, sings of this transformation: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "The German colonial dominion, a vast and unruly beast, was remarked upon by many for its cruelty, most vividly in the blood-drenched lands of German South West Africa where the Ovaherero and Nama peoples met their grim fate. Yet an empire so sprawling as this cannot be easily reckoned with a single tale of savagery. It was a tapestry of many colors, each colony a world unto its own with laws and manners as diverse as the lands they governed. In the realm of education too was such variance. When the British laid claim to German East Africa, known as Tanganyika, in the year 1919, they encountered a multitude of Africans not only schooled but literate. The Germans had sown seeds of learning across their holdings in Kamerun and beyond, earning the admiration of those who chronicled such endeavors.\n\nYet in the arid expanse of South West Africa, what they now call Namibia, the story was a different one. There, unlike in the green expanses of East Africa where the state had seen fit to build schools and take charge of educating the native populace, the burden fell almost entirely to missionaries, who struggled with scant aid from the government. It was the Europeans who received the state’s largess, with schools established for their benefit and missionary efforts therein strictly overseen and supported. The legacy of these policies lingered long after the Germans departed, leaving behind a land where the vast majority of its people remained untouched by the light of learning, their minds unawakened, their hands unlettered. The reasons for this divergence lay buried in the complex soil of social, political, and economic circumstance. This paper seeks to unearth these factors, guided by fresh inquiry into the hearts and minds of settlers and those who ruled them.\n\nThe annals of education under the German flag are rich, penned mostly in the mother tongue of those who sought to document the ways of teaching in lands far from home. These early works served to describe what was, laying bare the bones of the educational systems in the colonies. Later, voices speaking in English broadened the conversation, comparing the schools of different colonies and plumbing the depths of their particularities. They revealed a world of contrasts. Among these, Cohen’s study stands as a keystone, examining the schools of South West Africa and East Africa and unraveling the threads that set them apart. He points to the settlers of South West Africa, a people drawn to its mild climes amidst the desert's embrace, as a key to understanding the peculiarities of its schools.\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to the other lands held by Germany, offered a climate more forgiving, though much of it was swallowed by the barrenness of desert. The Europeans flocked to it, finding it more welcoming than other colonies. By 1913, the land bore witness to nearly 15,000 white souls, while East Africa, holding the next largest gathering of settlers, counted but 5,336.",
            "There was a time when the United States of America and the lands of Mexico were bound in a rivalry that stretched across the years like a shadow over the desert, a span of fifty-seven years from 1836 to 1893. It was a time marked by conflict, the high-water mark of which was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. Here the United States moved with force and took from Mexico the lands of Texas and what would become the American Southwest. Other confrontations followed, a simmering flame that would last until just before the Great War. These two nations were locked in a struggle, their differences rooted deep in matters of faith and custom, and in the clash of their material desires. \n\nBut this tale is not unique in the chronicles of nations. For those who share a border often find themselves at odds, their interests clashing like the meeting of two rivers. The United States and Mexico were no different from many such enduring rivalries that mark the history of neighboring lands. David M. Pletcher once spoke of the long shadows cast by these old American diplomatic problems, their roots tangled in the lands of Mexico and Cuba. These are the two that sit closest to the heart of the United States, while other brethren in Latin America have known times of peace and good relation.\n\nSo it was that religious discord drove a wedge between these two nations, a rift as old as the hills, and no stranger to the annals of human history. As Sally Frahm tells it, in those days past, Americans set themselves against the creeds of Catholicism and the rule of monarchy, just as in the later years they would stand against the specters of fascism and communism. This was a struggle of ideologies, not unlike the Cold War that would follow, yet rooted in the faith of the people, a legacy inherited from the distrust that lay between English and Spanish blood. A legacy that forged a barrier to peace between the United States and Mexico.\n\nIn the reckoning of Diehl and Goerts, there were seventeen disputes that marked the years of this rivalry. Most of them were born of territorial matters, of raids across borders and the lawlessness of the frontier. Bandits and outlaws ranged wild, a trouble that lingered until both nations brought forth their military might to tame the edges of their lands. Yet, as the years passed, the rivalry began to wane. Schmitt tells us it was because Mexico found itself in need of what the United States could offer, and the ambitions of America turned from the hunger for lands to the pursuit of economic influence in Mexico in the late days of the nineteenth century.",
            "Fifteen years past I found myself felled by an ailment unknown to me before. A sudden and unwelcome visitor that took hold and did not let go.\n\nI once wore the garb of a nurse. A choice born not from dreams but from necessity, a yearning for the security denied me in younger days. They said, you will always find work for the world is ever sick. And so the words echoed through the corridors of my youth. Though I longed to tread the paths of science or to wield the pen of a journalist, I chose the way of nursing.\n\nAnd there I stood at forty-six, alone and with little to my name, unable to labor. Still, the years have passed and I remain tethered to Social Security, owning nothing but the grit of survival. Each day is a trial, a siege upon my sense of safety and self-worth. Certainty is a ghost, yet one truth remains: I have endured these years only through the kindness of kin and the grace of friends. For when calamity comes, it strips away the facade of strength.\n\nLife is a series of emergencies, large and small. No promises are made and no preparation is ever enough for the burdens that may come. \n\nI see the cracks in the grand edifice of governance and understand the call for less reliance on it. But I would rather we turn to one another, learn again to trust and to aid, than to retreat into solitary fortresses of our own making.\n\nThe tales of old speak of rugged souls who carved this land, yet it was not solitary strength but shared compassion and resources that steadied them through the trials. Those who traversed the mountains in their caravans did not reach the ocean by solitude.\n\nSo yes, prepare. I do. A kit for disaster, supplies for wounds, tablets to cleanse water, and coverings for windows should the unthinkable arise. Flashlights and batteries, candles and matches sealed against the wet. Canned goods aplenty. If you have the means to till the earth and preserve its bounty, do so. A wood stove, too, if your home permits.\n\nBut as you gather these things, do not forget your neighbors.",
            "In the dim recesses of antiquity, sometime in the shadowy folds of the fifth or sixth century before the common era, there was a prince born into this world who would one day be known as the Buddha. His life was a journey away from princely pleasures, a path that led him to renounce the world and find a light within, a light that birthed a way of living that came to be known as Buddhism. Among the many branches that grew from this seed, Theravada stands as the most orthodox, a tradition that has seen the passage of twenty-five centuries and bears little resemblance to what the Buddha may have known. In distant lands like Sri Lanka, this change is visible in rituals such as the water-cutting ceremony, a practice untouched by the Buddha's teachings yet imbued with sacred meaning. The transformations, they run deep, from the surface of tradition to the very core of salvation. The Theravada community, both the robed and the unrobed, has bent and swayed to the winds of time, shaped by forces that are both of this world and outside it, forces both kind and cruel.\n\nTo trace these shifts, one must reckon with the terms of discourse. Internal and external, these are the markers of origin, the former arising from within the fold of the Buddhasasana, be they monk or layman, and the latter from those outside its sanctuary. Hostile forces, they bear the weight of scornful eyes, while benign forces drift indifferent, bringing change unbidden. These words will loop and twine through the telling.\n\nLet us turn to the heart of the matter, the doctrines that pulse at the center of Theravada Buddhism. The faithful find their refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, a corpus of teachings known as the Tripitaka, unfolds in three: the Sutta Pitaka with its sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka with its rules for the monastic life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka with its deeper metaphysical musings. Metaphysical notions like Anatta, the absence of self, Dukkha, the ever-present suffering, and Anicca, the impermanence that colors all things. Only by seeing these truths can one step off the wheel of Sansara, the endless cycle of birth and death. Enlightenment brings an end to the trio of lobha, dosa, and moha—desire, hatred, and delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka lays down the precepts for living: five for the laity, many more for the monks. At the heart lies the teaching of the four noble truths: life is suffering, suffering springs from attachment, and suffering can be transcended."
